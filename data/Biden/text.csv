1,Biden to pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession
1-1,"Meanwhile in Britain, it was reported this week that Tory Police Commissioners want to make cannabis a Class A drug, bringing it in line with cocaine and heroin.What a shitpit we have become."
1-1-1,"Imagine looking at all the US problems and saying ""yeah I want all those"" and speed-running towards them."
1-1-1-1,Naruto-running to reach peak stupid with the least amount of air resistance
1-1-1-2,"SCOTUS. Has entered the chat, also those laws from the late 1800’s were kinda lit, not gonna lie.we’re bringing them back. /s"
1-1-2,It's impressive how wrong she is about everything.
1-1-2-1,"Within a week, she came within *hours* of collapsing the economy handing out tax breaks to the rich. I'm still struggling to figure out why a lot of people still trust conservatives more with handling the economy."
1-1-2-1-2,Never trust conservatives. They only curtail to the rich.
1-1-2-1-3,"*""Because Labour are bad and dangerous!""* Says the media... Just look at the state of the country after these 12 years of Tory rule. There's no way in hell it can be anything else.They vote for austerity and wonder why they have no money, because they're told that if the other party gets in they'll have no money because of foreigners taking their jobs, and incompetent leaders who can't budget. Because a PM who gambled Brexit on his ego was competent, a PM who couldn't organise Brexit was competent, a PM who was criminally charged was competent, and a PM who, well, you summed her up pretty well... She's competent too I guess!"
1-2,“He’s only doing this to get votes!”No shit welcome to politics
1-2-1,yeah those accusations are always a hoot.Like okay? And I am going to reward the guy who catered to what I want with votes and hope he does more stuff like this. I'm not going to get mad and not vote for them because of some pointless need to question his motives if he is going to do what I want him to do.
1-2-1-1,"Maybe if any Republican had a platform they'd get voted too. Instead it's all just hateful shit slinging, seeing what will stick. They literally have no policies they're running on."
1-2-1-1-1,"they definitely have policies, they just do everything they can to prevent people from knowing about them because they are all very unpopular. then there are thew super secret fascist policies"
1-2-1-1-2,"I mean I agree with most of what you said fuck the right, but I see this often repeated on Reddit and it just isn’t true and makes them seem less dangerous then they actually are.Some of their specific policy goals are to cut taxes for the wealthy because they are bootlickers and tighten up border security because they are xenophobic"
1-2-1-2,We could maybe market it as being the first politician smart enough to figure out that representing the people is what they're there for.
1-2-3,Literally the entire point of a representative democracy is the politician votes for what the people they represent would vote for.
1-2-3-1,"crazy stuff, that"
1-3,"Actual holy shit moment lol. Fantastic news though, I'm glad Biden is doing this."
1-3-1,It’s weird that there’s actual change for the good lol it’s been bad news for the past 6 years
1-3-1-1,this and the student loan forgiveness…holy shit am I becoming team Biden?
1-3-1-1-1,"August was the beginning of the Dark Brandon arc. Gotta say, I'm a big fan"
1-3-1-1-1-1,He's evolved beyond Dark Brandon and is now Dank Brandon
1-3-1-1-1-1-2,All right that made me snort laugh.
1-3-1-1-1-2,Ok but previously Biden saved hundreds of thousands of lives by pushing covid vaccination requirements as broadly as he legally could. Vaccine hesitancy in the US is a huge deal and he essentially forced millions of people to get the shot in order to keep their jobs. I don't understand why that somehow gets overlooked.  So many dumbasses worried more about their jobs than their lives and he made the right call to save them.  Dude's a legitimate hero.
1-3-1-1-1-3,No one fucks with a Biden.
1-3-1-1-2,Last three months he’s kinda been killin it
1-3-1-1-2-1,"I think he was saving all of his good shit for September/October so Democrats look better going into the mid term election.It would be politically stupid to do it any other way, but it's annoying waiting 2 years for the president to actually do something decent."
1-3-1-1-2-1-1,"If the reporting is accurate, it sounded like it really took that long to convince him on the student loans. But if that is true, I'm glad he was willing to have an open mind about it. Nowadays if you change your mind for any reason at any time, it's seen as a weakness."
1-3-1-1-2-1-1-1,I think part of it is also the behind-the-scenes research part of figuring out exactly how much can be done with Executive actions without running into Republicans immediately taking things to the currently incredibly biased Supreme Court to complain about Constitutionality.
1-3-1-1-2-1-1-3,"This is the trait that I like about Biden, that he's perfectly open to evolution on basically any policy issue. That's what a good leader should do."
1-3-1-1-2-1-2,You didn’t read through his build back better act very thoroughly. Biden’s been trying to do tremendous work since he stepped into office. Unfortunately our other branches of government often step in our democratic leaders way.
1-3-1-1-2-1-2-1,"These people are trying to smear President Biden with all the ""He purposefully waited until election time to do this just to get votes, bUt It'S gOoD tHAt He DiD sOmEtHiNg."" They won't give this President any credit without taking a dig or just straight lying on POTUS Joe.They blame President Biden for gas prices going up but the minute He gets credit for gas prices dropping it is back to the President's don't have any impact on gas prices, bs.I don't get how these people are not tiring to their own selves."
1-3-1-1-2-1-3,Exactly what he was doing. I agree it's been frustrating as well.
1-3-1-1-2-1-3-1,"Play the game you’re playing, not the one you want to be playing."
1-3-1-1-2-1-5,Would sure be nice if people's memories lasted longer than a couple months at most.
1-3-1-1-2-2,"I'm going to say it: He's actually been killing it since issuing those 12 executive orders on day 1 of his presidency. Keep in mind he had a world of Trump trash to clean up before he could really start laying down his policies in earnest. That said, Biden has done more for the LGBT community than any president in history, he's reunited families Trump separated (still in progress), he *humanely* dealt with the overcrowding at the texas border facilities that Trump left him, he taught the world a masterclass in how to deal with Russia which essentially neutered a global superpower and enemy nation without a drop of American blood, he handled the covid vaccine rollout like a boss, got everyone free test kits pretty much as needed... the list is a lot longer than I want to type right now.Biden's been remarkably effective and progressive since taking office.I actually think when he told those wall street guys, ""nothing will fundamentally change,"" Biden bamboozled them."
1-3-1-1-2-2-1,"> I actually think when he told those wall street guys, ""nothing will fundamentally change,"" Biden bamboozled them.The context of that quote is missing. He was telling them that he was going to raise their taxes and that they could afford to pay more without it fundamentally changing their lives. It was basically “you can pay more taxes and in your life nothing will fundamentally change.”"
1-3-1-1-2-2-2,">I actually think when he told those wall street guys, ""nothing will fundamentally change,"" Biden bamboozled them.The thing about that line is it's always been misconstrued and taken out of context. He was talking about how a marginal increase in their tax rate wasn't going to mean they would have to move out of their mansion or that hordes of angry mobs were going to come for them."
1-3-1-1-2-2-2-1,"Sure. But if Biden manages to reschedule Marijuana and legalize it, that's actually a massive sea change in American policy. Not just for drugs. It's going to tear down a lot of the for-profit prison system that relies on these cheap and long-term convictions, and greatly affect corporations that abuse the slave labor these prisons provide courtesy of the 13th amendment. It will also flood the workforce with more available labor.This WILL shake up wall street, I guarantee it."
1-3-1-1-2-2-4,"Let’s not forget the infrastructure bill, CHIPS, and the greenness of the Inflation Reduction act, putting the first black woman on the Supreme Court. I hear a lot of people shit on the guy, when he really has done a Hell of a lot of functional good in my own opinion. Could he do better, yes, but I can’t say he hasn’t done a lot of great stuff."
1-3-1-1-2-3,"His first 100 days in office were pretty stacked too, mostly in terms of executive orders and reversing a lot of the harmful Trump policies"
1-3-1-1-3,"He know's he's got an election coming up. The right wing stirs up voters with fear, racism, and religious extremism. The left wing stirs up votes by...let's see...implementing initiatives that benefit the country and are actually popular with voters. Crazy how that works."
1-3-1-1-5,"Biden has been the most progressive President since FDR, and arguably in history. He has been incredibly effective, setting records for judicial appointments, passing the largest infrastructure bill in history, passing the largest climate package in history (and in the west), strengthening federal agencies to tackle drug prices and energy and climate and food safety, re-engaged allies on climate pacts, made the largest hostile foreign power look like a limpdick bitch while simultaneously displaying the prowess of the American intelligence community by predicting every single move of Putin's, student loan forgiveness, pot pardons, etc, etc, etc.The guy has been incredibly successful in a polarized and split government, and it's been disheartening to see him get no credit up until the last few months."
1-3-1-1-5-1,"The thing is, he's been doing all these good things and *not really caring* about getting the credit.I think the fact that he continues to chug along and just doing things without the expectation of praise should be like...absolute bare minimum for a national leader."
1-3-1-1-5-2,"Yeah it sucks that people have a short memory span, only notice big things that very directly affect them, and like to label. Biden has been pretty effective all along, but getting shit from all sides of people until recently."
1-3-1-2,"I keep telling my indignant and stubborn fellows on the left that Biden is running the most progressive administration in history and no number of reruns of his opinions 40 years ago change that. It's nice to see people becoming overwhelmed with the amount of positive policy changes and regain some hope that, yes, voting does, in fact, matter."
1-3-2,"Anybody still pushing that “both sides are the same shit” can stfu forever. A Republican would never do this in a million years. Dems are far from perfect, but they’re the only logical choice for any sort of progress in the country."
1-3-2-1,"People are oddly disconnected from whatever maturity they may have in their personal lives when it comes to politics. There are plenty of people we know in real life who are far from perfect but genuinely trying, as opposed to people who straight up do not give a shit and are psychopaths. Obviously democrat politicians and republican politicians are a large sample size and there are genuine republicans (or at least there use to be) and corrupt asshole democrats but I do feel like a lot more democrats are genuinely attempting to make America a better place versus the Republican Party that is generally made to enrich a select few at the expense of many."
1-4,"I take personal pleasure in using my medical marijuana (legal in my state) rather than opioids for chronic pain. Fuck you, Sackler family.Edit: this comment blew up, so I wanted to add please vote on this issue. Head over to [the Cannabis Voter Project] to see where your lawmakers stand and register to vote."
1-4-1,Imagine all the lives that’ll be saved from people *not* OD’ing on their (or someone else’s) pain meds!
1-4-2,"Holy, I just finished dopesick they portrayed really well how shit the sackler family really is. Btw it’s a must watch! Super Dope mini series (pun intended)"
1-4-2-1,"And if you don't like it, just double the dose and watch it again."
1-4-2-1-1,Yo my jaw literally dropped when they released the pill that they had to change the shape cuz it didn’t fit!!!!
1-4-2-2,"I finished watching it a few days ago. It was incredible. I was discussing it with my doctor on Monday, and the venom in her words was palpable when speaking about the Sacklers. She works at the VA, so she’s seen firsthand how the OxyContin explosion came at the perfect time to entrap thousands of Iraq & Afghan veterans suffering from physical and mental trauma."
1-4-3,"It's been such a godsend. I was pretty straight-edged when it came to marijuana during my teens and young adult years, I tended more towards alcohol. I got my card in my 40's for chronic knee pain I've had for YEARS.Not only does has my knee feel great since starting in the program, but I also lost any real desire for alcohol. I went from a large goblet of whiskey or two every night to basically having a handful of drinks over the course of several months. I've lost about 30lbs. Mentally, I feel healthier and less anxious than I've ever felt before.It's been life-changing"
1-5,"This is huge! Hopefully, federal legalization is next"
1-5-1,And protections against employment. It makes sense to not allow people under the influence at work but should not matter if people do it in their own free time.
1-5-1-1,California is doing this.
1-5-2,"President Biden may be waiting until after midterms to attempt full legalization, because he thinks there will be political fallout and/or he is waiting on more support from Congress.Hopefully it gets decriminalized soon enough before the midterms to help the Democrats out."
1-5-2-1,"You should read the article before commenting.&#x200B;Biden has already started the process to change or deschedule marijuana.&#x200B;Edit: comment above me completely edited their comment, it no longer says what it originally did."
1-5-2-1-3,"Reschedule, not deschedule. If he actually legalizes it that will be a giant surprise to me."
1-5-2-1-3-1,He can't. Telling the respective agencies to start the review process is all he can do. Legalization would require those agencies deciding to deschedule it or a congressional bill.
1-5-3,"I'm not trying to downplay what an awesome decision this is, but exactly under what circumstances are people *federally* charged for *personal possession*?It was my understanding that having large quantities (over 1oz) or having multiple bags of marijuana was automatically an ""intent to distribute"" charge (which *wouldn't* be simple possession, no?)."
1-5-3-1,"For people whose work requires they receive and maintain U.S. Security clearance, we are tested regularly for controlled substance use.So removing it from the controlled substance list is a big deal to some in a different way than worrying about a federal charge for personal possession."
2,Biden welcomes Zelenskyy to White House.
2-2,Zelensky rocking his formal sweat shirt.
2-2-1,Russia attacked and he was like “fuck this shit I’m going full athleisure” and never looked back
2-2-1-1,I mean…who wouldn’t use any excuse to not wear a suit?
2-2-1-1-1,"It’s how I battled Covid, sweatpants and hoody year 3 coming up"
2-2-1-1-1-1,Hard pants are almost dead to me.  Soft pants FTW!
2-2-1-1-1-1-2,"I am a department head in my org.When we were told we had to prepare to return to work one day a week, after two full years away, I told my team during a meeting that I would need to buy pants.They thought I was joking.Narrator: *He was not joking.*"
2-2-1-1-3,Right? You don't need a suit to be important. Useless and it's time to move on. I'd be fine with Biden in a sweater.
2-2-1-1-5,"I don't know, I really like wearing suits, including ties  but hardly have occasions to wear them."
2-2-1-1-5-1,"There's something special feeling about a comfortable, well fitted, well made with good materials pant, shirt, suit, tie, vest, and jacket that cannot be replicated by regular clothes or even rack suits.  I had to wear shirt and tie, jacket optional, everyday for school uniforms growing up."
2-2-1-1-5-1-1,"Not for me, fuck formal attire.Have had a nice custom fit suit, absolutely hated every minute in the thing."
2-2-1-2,Somehow he was also getting gore tex Air Force 1s.
2-2-1-2-1,"You wouldn’t believe the efforts Nike go through to get their products on someone with even minor public attention. The leader of Ukraine, and a viral figure essentially supported by half the world? They probably flew an intern in to hand deliver it to him."
2-2-1-2-2,The drip is critical for the war effort
2-2-1-2-2-1,Throw fits not bombs
2-2-1-2-3,I mean the most famous Gore-Tex AF1 is only like $250. They’re not hard to come by. He was an actor. Maybe he’s a sneaker head.
2-2-1-2-3-1,I didn’t mean to imply they were hard to come by at all. Just figured someone out there was hooking him up with them. I doubt the guy is actively shopping for sneakers lately. 
2-2-2,I actually like the choice he made to only wear simple clothes while the country is under siege.
2-2-2-1,also it has Ukrainian coat of arms. i’m sure it’s not a random choice
2-2-2-1-1,I'm sure he puts thought into how he appears publicly during times of war.Visual imagery is important and his outfit shows he stands with the country and not above it.
2-2-2-1-1-1,Plus the olive green color he's always wearing implies support with his military
2-2-2-2,"Exactly, it's more human than all the suits"
2-2-2-2-1,A man of the people
2-2-2-2-1-1,One might say.....A Servant of the People.Слуга народу
2-2-2-2-1-1-1,I LOVE that show and have went back and watched a lot of it and it is really funny and ironic as shit now!
2-2-4,A trend I can get behind. I wouldn’t be sad if suits became a thing of the past
2-2-4-4,Suits are just pyjamas that are okay to wear in public.
2-3,"Welcome to America. Allow me to introduce you to your new friend, The Patriot Missile."
2-3-1,For your consideration… The Jericho Missile.
2-3-1-1,!
2-3-1-1-1,That’s how dad did it. That’s how America does it… And it’s worked out pretty well so far.
2-3-1-1-1-1,> And it’s worked out pretty well so far.Jesus fucking Christ it's amazing how much character development that prick had ahead of him.
2-3-2,"""Say hello to my little friend.""*\*Puts on aviators\**"
2-3-2-1,!
2-3-2-1-2,!
2-3-2-1-2-1,*A Dark Brandon appears*
2-3-2-1-3,Ok I really love that this gif is the president
2-4,Biden's tie is elegantly Ukrainian.
2-4-1,Good catch
2-4-1-1,"Idk why but the fact that the top comment is about the colour of his tie really kind of makes me happy. I was opening the comments expecting to see a plethora of political bullshit, which I'm sure I'll find if I keep scrolling but the fact that the mundanity of his tie colour was the first thing I saw just really soothed me."
2-4-2,"It caught my eye immediately. Probably the shiniest tie I’ve ever seen.Very dapper, Mr. Pres."
2-4-4,Wait what? I see it as black and yellow...Is it blue and yellow?Damn dresses again
3,President Biden’s wholesome reaction
3-1,Isn't that the child that lost his dad in a school shooting?
3-1-3,Oh god that's heartbreaking
3-1-4,Didn't knew this now this is even more emotional
3-2,"[When Joe Biden visited with the victims' families from the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School two years ago, a man with special needs who lost his father simply wanted a hug during a devastating time.]"
3-2-1,I wanna know why they called him “the former Vice President.” Instead of just the president.
3-2-1-1,He wasn’t the president at that time.
3-3,The way the young man blurts out “I’m his son” with such raw emotion just hits to the core.
3-3-1,"Apart from my opinion about U.S. presidents, this was the most humane act by a U.S. president I have ever seen."
3-3-1-1,"Yes I agree, politics aside.It almost seems Biden needed that hug as well. Being president and having to bounce from one place to the next and making decisions that doesnt always get support from both sides, little moments like this have to feel like ""this person doesnt need me to be the president right now, they just need me to be human and care just for a moment."""
3-3-1-1-1,“Thank you for hugging me!”I think you’re absolutely right there
3-3-1-1-2,"Biden also carries the weight of the loss of his son, too."
3-3-1-1-2-1,As well his wife and daughter. The man has lost most of his family in his lifetime.
3-3-1-1-2-1-1,"He is a strong man.. I truly admire that, not many men could survive over this"
3-3-1-1-2-2,Wait what happened?
3-3-1-1-2-2-3,"His wife and daughter died in I believe it was car accident many years ago*edit* Correction as others pointed out,  it was his wife and daughter in the car accident. Also as well his son dying of cancer a few years ago."
3-3-1-1-3,"There's a reason the presidency ages people so quickly.The president doesn't control everything the way people think they do, but they sure as hell have to be always on. I'm genuinely surprised that more of them haven't just keeled over out of nowhere, especially given the fact that we seem compelled to elect only the elderly these days."
3-3-1-1-4,Yes and more yes.
3-3-1-2,"Brought tears to my eyes seeing this video. Putting aside politics, he is a nice human being."
3-3-1-5,Yea i dont like biden but seeing him do that for this young man was really heart warming. You can hear the pain in his voice when he said im his son
3-3-2,Can’t wait for the right to twist it into something gross.
3-3-2-1,“Did you see him kiss that boy? I thought he was only creepy like that with little girls!!”
3-3-2-1-2,Did you just quote the sick voice in your head?
3-3-2-1-2-1,"No, they were giving an example of what they expect the right to do with this. Because they will. They will meme it to death in the most classless way possible, because that's all the MAGA base is any more."
3-4,this was real grampa energy right there
3-5,He did it without hesitation and sincerely. Just how a grandfather would react to a grandson who is having a tough emotional time.
3-5-1,"I honestly don't like Biden and his policies, especially when considering his entire career as a politician not just as presidentBut this just further solidifies something else I think about Biden - he genuinely cares about the people, and I might disagree on a of his choices but do think he's doing what he thinks is best. And really, that's huge - especially these days. The man has my respect"
4,Biden's having a good week
4-1,"Representative ""what's her name, who believes in the... anyway"" perfect way to refer to a total nobody."
4-1-2,"Unfortunately, no sitting congresswoman is a ""nobody"" hell, no sane world would make someone like her a ""nobody"" a sane world would imprison her, lockaway the key, then stick a hidden camera in the cell to watch whatever insane bullshit starts oozing from her brainchasm"
4-1-2-1,I mean Biden has been in Congress since the 70s. He's probably seen more than his fair share of flash in the pan freshman reps.
4-2,Those wingnuts who got bailed out of their ppp gifts walked right into this shooting gallery
4-2-2,Turn in those ppp fraudsters if you know of any. I heard you get a reward for it.
4-2-2-1,30%.Many people are saying it.
4-2-2-1-1,The best people?
4-2-2-1-1-1,"You know it, I know it, everyone knows it"
4-2-3,"if you live in a glass palace funded by forgiven tax dollar PPP loans, you probably shouldn’t bring a jello to a Dozens battle. - Joltin Joe Bidenwow can’t believe this is my most upvotes comment :)edit please don’t waste money on reddit awards, donate to a local Dem that’s up for election this year.thanks for the gold though:)"
4-2-3-1,# D A R K B R A N D O N
4-2-3-1-1,This may be the redemption arc we've been looking for
4-2-3-1-1-1,Those recent bills were a good precursor for this. He got shit done and now he's having a little fun. Hopefully more of both to come
4-2-3-1-1-1-1,"Pretty sure it’s because it’s election season and the Dems have been getting their ass kicked for a few months, but I’ll take it. I welcome angry Joe."
4-2-3-1-1-1-2,"Imo, he was holding back to court Manchin and Sinema on the one or two things that *needed* to be passed before the midterms, and now that he's got them and it's looking like Dems are charged to do well in the midterms, he's going all out."
4-2-3-1-1-1-2-1,"I hope so, but that also assumes Manchin and sinema didn't see this coming because if Democrats win big then those 2 lose their role as obstructionists. Perhaps despite being dinos they still want democrat agendas to succeed so they are content with voting against everything whether or not it passes so they can tell their constituents they tried.It would be easier for me to believe they are playing along because they already know the next election is going to be a shit show"
4-2-3-1-2,"This is Dark Brandon Begins, I can’t wait for the The Dark Brandon, and The Dark Brandon Rises!"
4-2-4,"Democrats should do things like this more often.It’s obvious they would do these things, and the GOP is so used to popping off regardless or how hypocritical or ridiculous it is.Line up your responses to what you KNOW they will say, and crush them the second they say what they will obviously vomit out."
4-2-5,The fact that the official white house twitter is out here ratioing Republicans is the cherry on top of the shit sandwhich of our government. I laughed so mf hard when I saw that this morning
4-3,He was gonna say Jewish space laser wasn’t he
4-3-1,"Could be, but honestly she's given us so much crazy it's hard to pick one."
4-3-1-1,He probably went with this so we could fill in the blank with our favorite quote from that person
4-3-1-1-2,Can’t wait for people to edit in clips of her rants. And they say the left can’t meme
4-3-1-1-2-2,The problem with lefty memes is that they spell the words correctly and that's insulting. Fucking smarty com... comoonis... commies.
4-3-1-4,Which is the brilliance of this line. Let the speculation memes flow over the internets.
4-3-3,**DARK BRANDON GOBLIN MODE**
4-4,I wonder wtf happened this week lolThere had to be a single event that tipped the scale and they chose to unleash dark Brandon on the masses
4-4-1,The White House got a new social media director in the last month. She's a young woman from New Jersey known for being savvy and smart. Those tweets this week were not a coincidence.
4-4-1-1,Bless her and her fight against fascism!
4-4-1-2,I agree. I don’t believe she is getting the credit she deserves. This is going to change the tone of politics from here on out.
4-4-2,"So, while I can obviously offer no proof for this, my dad was a driver for the White House during the end of the Bush years and Obama's first term. [Went back to active duty after, he hated working in DC] He was never Obama or Biden's driver, but heard plenty about both from the other drivers.According to him, this guy right here? Dark Brandon? Is what Biden's actually like. So maybe the White House just went ""you know what, fuck it, go be you, sir""."
4-4-2-1,"He's always had a lot of 'snark' about him, but it seems with the big elections he puts that away to be what everyone thinks a politician should be like. The snark is what got him where he is though. Well an intelligent snark."
4-4-2-1-1,"I still fondly remember “will you shut up, man?” "
4-4-2-1-1-1,"For me, it was when trump tried to zing him about his kid’s drug problem and he said “My son, like a lot of people, like lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He’s fixed it, he’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.” Not as punchy as “will you shut up, man” but it was significant, particularly for the recovering addicts I know."
4-4-2-1-1-1-1,"What a complete trash, sorry-ass motherfucker Trump was for going there. Not that it was a surprise, but Jesus what a despicable piece of low-rent trash he is.I remember the emotion in Biden’s voice when he answered. You could hear the heartache in his reply.Regardless of your political views, when you think about the loss that man’s had in his life - a wife and child to a car wreck, then a son to cancer, and then the struggles and heartache of two children with drug problems (Ashley Biden, also), you’ve got to respect him for still standing (and for not walking over and ripping Trump’s throat out).Certainly no wonder there’s a dark Brandon…."
4-4-2-1-1-1-3,I ugly cried . I bet he really moved a lot of people with that response.
4-4-2-1-1-2,"""Will you shut up, man?"" ""It hurts nobody, it helps everybody"" and ""They should have an ice cream"" are forever a part of my lexicon"
4-4-2-1-1-3,"""This is a big fucking deal!"" caught on the hot mic is my favorite. Not snark per se, but so heartfelt in the moment."
4-4-2-1-1-3-1,When he defended his drug addict son by saying he loves him was another great moment. Politicians being honest and acting like real people instead of the usual bloviating is always great.
4-4-2-1-1-4,This is what always gets me. That’s when I actually liked him as a candidate. The “fuck it” attitude is so welcome. Let’s stop being so cordial about how fucking childish they’re being.
4-4-2-1-1-5,He said on live TV what every sane person in the nation had been waiting to hear and it was glorious.
4-4-2-1-2,"I also feel like since he inherited a shitshow, he's been head down sorting through the chaos. Finally, he got a minute to breathe and was like ""now, what the fuck was I supposed to be doing?"""
4-4-2-1-2-2,"Also his approval was in the gutter, maybe they were like, ""fuck it, can't get any worse, you do you sir"""
4-4-2-1-2-3,So much this. Imagine expecting productivity in the first hundred days when he inherited a broken underfunded govt that was missing nuclear documents.
4-4-2-1-4,"Similar mistake Hillary made. Ultimately she was terrible at reading the room, but if she had figured out the times were right to be her actual self on the campaign trail she would have infuriated the right and energized everybody else."

4-4-2-3,"That's the motherfucker I was hoping for when I voted for him in 2020. I'm so glad my hopes became a reality, at least for now."
4-4-2-3-1,"Exactly. I voted for the man who told Trump to his face, on national television “will you shut up, man?”"
4-4-2-3-1-1,"That “will you shut up, man” was a collective sentiment for literally half the country.When he said that, it felt like a huge release on what I’ve been bottling up the last 4 years lol."
4-4-2-3-1-1-1,"That's unfair, it was more than half."
4-4-2-3-1-3,"That was such a gorgeous moment. I actually commented about that on Reddit recently when I was on a thread about how Howard dean got so much shit for what was basically an enthusiastic ""wahoo!"""
4-4-2-3-1-4,"The one that called out Peter Douche-y's horseshit near an active mic: ""No, it’s a great asset — more inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch.”"
4-4-2-3-1-5,It's what I think we all learned from Hillary. She just ignored him and it just made him bolder. You've got to hit a bully sometimes or they'll never learn.
4-4-2-3-1-5-1,"I wish he had a little spray bottle to squirt him with whenever he started acting up in the debates. Probably would’ve melted his orange glow, too."
4-4-2-4,"When Obama picked him for VP, wasn't part of the reason at the time because Biden was supposed to be a bit abrasive and not afraid to go out on the attack?  Obama needed to be all about positivity and hope, so he needed his VP candidate to be the ones to get their hands dirty and go on the offensive.Somehow he morphed into friendy-old-man Biden during his tenure as VP, but he was originally supposed to basically be the attack dog for Obama."
4-4-2-4-2,That and he knew how to get shit done on the hill.
4-4-2-4-3,"Obama couldn't afford to be branded 'an angry black man' by the GOP so that's what Joe was for.    And has anyone forgotten the friendship memes with Obama?I still recall Biden threatening to take Trump behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.  He was born a 'coal cracker', I live in coal country....he still fits right in.   And yes, we all know what malarkey is.  It's basically all Celtic and German bloodlines in the area.  We're great folks until you piss us off, then the Irish Vendettas kick in.  And yes, we still praise the Molly Maguires and curse the Pinkertons."
4-4-2-4-3-1,"Biden's chosen secret service codename for himself is ""celtic"".Thought that's apt."
4-4-2-4-3-1-1,nah that’s toughhhhhdark brandon has gained a lot of respect from me recently
4-4-2-4-3-1-1-1,His mother once refused to sleep in a bed because queen Elizabeth had also slept in it. He inherited that feistiness.
4-4-3,"It's definitely because midterms are around the corner and his approval rating is super low, but it's working I am loving Dark Brandon."
4-4-3-1,"This was my thought. There had to have been some advisor(s) that said “hey, people like you a lot more when you fight back. You should start doing that more”"
4-4-3-2,It’s actually been going up considerably the last few weeks. Last I saw he was at 44% and rising which isn’t amazing it is much better than I last saw it (a few months ago it was in the low 30s)
4-4-3-2-2,"I used to consider him as ""Meh, not my first choice, but not terrible like the alternative.""But after the Build Back Better and the student loan forgiveness, I'm like ""Hell yeah! Let's fucking gooooo∼∼∼"""
4-4-3-2-3,"If you plot gas prices and Biden’s approval rating (inverted), it’s the same chart. People were just mad about gas."
4-4-4,"New “Sick burn” strategy in play, staffers working on zingers instead of speeches.  Idea is to reduce support for the right by just mocking it… no one wants to get made fun of."
4-4-5,"From the random comments that slip out, dark Brandon is the true Brandon."
4-5,"Damn Dark Brandon ""I don't think about you at all""'d her"
4-5-1,Probably one of the coldest lines that Draper dropped. Woof.
4-5-1-1,lmfao I'm loving this timeline of the Left starting to embrace cultural war memes. I love it. We needed this. Biden is based.
4-5-1-1-1,Lol let’s not get carried away. He’s still center-right on the global scale. I do love the memes tho 
4-5-1-1-1-1,"Doing the bare minimum is better than doing nothing. And he is doing the bare minimum. Don't forget that ""nothing"" is the lowest bar to compare anything to. But yes, he is still most definitely a neoliberal."
4-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Totally agree. “The bare minimum” will always beat, you know, actively dismantling every ounce of social progress from the last 50 years. Not quite based, though lol"
4-5-1-1-1-1-1-1,“American flavor based”

4-5-3,One of the most badass lines in tv

4-5-5,I definitely didn’t have Biden get fed up and dishing out sass on my 2022 bingo card
5,President Joe Biden to propose new 20% minimum billionaire tax
5-1,Checks Senate roster..... not happening.
5-1-1,"there's 4 Republican congressman worth over $100m each and ~20 congressman worth between $20m and $100m so I'm going to go out on a limb and say they won't be voting for thisEdit to clarify a couple things:1) I used this list:   I wasn't trying to ""single out"" Republicans.  That list only shows 4 members worth $100m or more and they are all Republican.  There are 12 Democrats on that list worth between $20m and $96m.  This post has had several responses accusing me of playing the party game and that was not my intention at all.2) I understand that this is a billionaire tax, but I can't see members of Congress that are worth tens of millions of dollars voting in favor of it.  Call it intuition."
5-1-1-1,Get rich by serving the agenda of the wealthy at the cost of the average Joe. Join wealthy and serve your own wallet from that point on.It's hard to understand how people accept politicians becoming mysteriously wealthy on a wage that could never support that kind of growth. There's not much to deduce to understand what's going on there.
5-1-1-1-1,"EXACTLY!    It just seems like most Republicans are wealthy when they arrive but many Democrats become wealthy afterward.At the end of the day, they all need to stop serving themselves and serve The People.No more legal insider trading.Want to fix healthcare?    Make them participate in the same as The People.    No more special healthcare for Senators & Congress etc.Want to fix social security?     Make them participate.    No more special, life long benefits.Want to fix tax?    They must pay tax also.And at day's end, it's our fault for not holding them accountable in a way."
5-1-1-1-1-2,We can start by having them go to the DMV:[They had a \*secret\* DMV serving the CA State Capitol. That is beyond cringe level of self-dealing.
5-1-1-1-1-4,Yes to all. Funny how it has gotten so horrible and this far.
5-1-1-1-1-5,"Hmm congress people make $174,000 a year. With that kinda salary it isn’t hard to increase your net worth especially with a financial advisor.It really sounds like you’re trying to accuse democrats of gaming the system but the system already is there to make congress people rich."
5-1-1-2,No Republican will vote for this.
5-1-1-2-1,No republican will vote for anything if the proposal came from BidenThe majority of republicans key position is being anti dem
5-1-1-2-1-1,They are literally children
5-1-1-2-1-1-1,Sounds like the democrats do the same thing
5-1-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Probably, but at least they can admit they lost an election, they don't support domestic terrorism, and don't support a war criminal just to oWn tHe LiBs"
5-1-1-2-1-1-2,"call them children, that’s fine. at least they don’t support the perverse genital castration of children.. or the murder of children.. or the sexual molestation of children.."
5-1-1-2-1-1-2-1,Neither do Democrats so....Your point??
5-1-1-2-1-1-3,Both sides are children and it was in fact the democrats and Nancy pelosi who used this kind of “warfare” in politics. She always has said I don’t need the other side if I have my votes and famously passed Obama care by herself after Obama tried to get the some of the republicans on the bill but did not succeed. Now the republicans are just as bad now. The whole system is a joke of itself while the post here itself points out they are all millionaires close to the billions. Seems odd
5-1-1-2-1-1-3-1,"You really need to do some more research into what actually happened with Obama care.Obama presented a republican health care bill, let the Republicans chop it up and amend the fuck out of it, still couldn't get any support at all because partisanship, then rammed it through because fuck the Republicans at that point. Bad faith losers who all get money from foreign governments (nra), and literally have no real policy except to discredit democrats and be a nuisance."
5-1-1-2-1-1-3-3,"I love that your whataboutism is literally the exact opposite of what we are talking about.Op example: red never votes blueYour example:well if red never votes blue and we have the votes fuck em.Your basically saying it is hypocritical for democrats to pass any legislation without republican approval.If the Republicans have to approve of everything democrats do, why have parties?"
5-1-1-2-1-1-4,Children? The democrats literally creates a lie about Russia to impeach Trump because he didn’t stand for their bullshit. Sounds like a bunch of lying babies if you as me.
5-1-1-2-1-1-4-1,I'm not sure what you're talking about.The first impeachment was because he attempted a quid pro quo with Ukraine and the second impeachment was because his supporters stormed the capitol trying to overthrow the election with his support.
5-1-1-2-1-1-4-2,so a independent investigation done by a life long respected republican official/veteran . that uncovered numerous dealings with Russia and trump/administration /family/campaign are false?
5-1-1-2-1-1-4-3,"The Democrats are the absolute worst. They play the filthiest politics possible, for decades now, and are the ones who signal that the other side refuses to cooperate on anything. At least the Republicans are open about their policy and not doing the opposite of what they preach. Is it coincidence that the housing crisis is only a real crisis in blue states?"
5-1-1-2-1-1-5,It’s explicitly unconstitutional to tax someone of their wealth.
5-1-1-2-1-3,but isn’t one of democrats main positions being anti republican
5-1-1-2-1-3-1,"Well after they attempted the coup and then brushed it off like nothing happened, yeah I’d say they’re pretty anti republican. BUT, the amount of democrat senators that will vote NO solely based on support from republicans, is a lot less than the 50 republicans who vote no on every single piece of dem sponsored legislation that would help the common people"
5-1-1-2-1-3-2,"It definitely can go both ways. I’m neither dem nor republican, but I think in general democrats are less likely to oppose something solely based on republicans supporting it than the other way around. This isn’t based on any sort of statistic. It just *seems* that while both parties are generally anti-the other party, Democrats are more likely to be open minded than republicans."
5-1-1-2-1-3-3,If anti Republican means pro AmericanYes
5-1-1-2-1-3-3-1,so half of americans are actually anti american?
5-1-1-2-1-4,I bet this would never happen the other way around right?   Right?
5-1-1-2-1-4-1,We have proof it doesn’t
5-1-1-2-1-5,That's because being a Dem is the same as anti-American.
5-1-1-2-1-5-1,Delusion
5-1-1-2-1-5-1-1,"Not if you look at their agenda and actions.  It's fact.  Democrats, generally speaking, hate America."
5-1-1-2-2,Because they love the rich and hate the poor. Even though most of them are poor. Brilliant really
5-1-1-2-2-1,"Yet congresspeople are rich, so none of them will vote for this."
5-1-1-2-2-1-1,"I stand with the small American family, the people just working blue collar jobs that run our country*gets elected*Alright, so what do I need to vote against to get that cushy corporate paycheck? Everything that helps the people who voted for me? Okay!Seriously, I'm convinced at this point that republicans just want to put the country into hard mode for everyone. Everything they support just ends up making socioeconomic mobility harder and locks more and more of their own into inescapable poverty and lower-middle classedness"
5-1-1-2-2-2,"No, the Republicans won’t vote for it because a Democrat is proposing it, as the Republicans are sore ass losers so deluded they would rather run this country into the ground by trying to stop any progress than let Biden do some good"
5-1-1-2-2-2-1,Republicans have demonstrated time and time again they don’t care about poor people. So not sure how you’re quickly just discarding my statement with a no
5-1-1-2-2-2-1-1,They’re saying republicans won’t accept or vote for anything beneficial to their constituents if it’s proposed by a democrat. They’re right
5-1-1-2-2-3,Also owning the libs.
5-1-1-2-2-4,People that really hate the poor are actually Democrats. Their policies does nothing but impoverish people- while they think giving massive handouts is helping the “poor” it does the exact opposite.
5-1-1-2-2-4-1,Nah. Democrat policies prove you’re wrong
5-1-1-2-2-4-1-1,"As a black man, I’ve seen the destruction of Democrats policies in my neighborhoods, and I say I will NEVER give my vote to those people ( although they think they own black votes)"
5-1-1-2-2-4-1-2,Which policies prove me wrong? Push to defund and abolish law enforcement? Soft on crimes? Open borders to allow massive uncontrolled immigration that will directly affect minorities already in the U.S? Allowing men to compete in girls sports? Massive welfare that keeps more people in poverty? Dividing black peoples against white people by lying to them that they’re “oppressed” and whites are the devil?
5-1-1-2-2-5,"They’ve drank the American dream koolaid, think if they stay at Walmart for 30 years they’ll retire a billionaire."
5-1-1-2-4,"Also, very few democrats will vote for this. If they do it is only because they know it won't pass and it makes them look good."
5-1-1-4,Don’t forget the democratic corrupt pelosi and her husband
5-1-1-4-1,They are extremely rich.
5-1-1-5,How bout Nancy Pelosi? Queen of insider trading whilst holding public office.
5-1-2,Yup Sinema has stated she wont raise taxes on the wealthy
5-1-2-1,"So start a concerted effort to primary her. Things don't happen overnight, but there is still a process, and we know what needs to be done. She needs to go."
5-1-2-1-1,I'm pretty sure that Gallego will be announcing his candidacy for Senate in 2024 immediately after he wins his House election this year.I hope he demolishes her.
5-1-2-1-1-1,Pretty sure she has already planned to run for re-election as an independent.  Seems like she has had that plan from the beginning.
5-1-2-1-1-1-2,Seems like a really dumb plan.  Who does she think is going to vote for her?
5-1-2-2,"This is obviously a problem, but the democrats need to learn how to force senators and reps like her to make difficult political decisions if they want to actually remove these people.Obviously there are all sorts of tweedledees that will vote for a number of stupid things, but youll never turn the general population against these faux democrats by avoiding votes. Make them vote on a flat income tax to billionaires, or social security or medicare measures, and their voter base would shrink quickly."
5-1-2-2-1,"Yeah, so often they don't even bring something to a vote because they know it will not pass, but we need those votes so we can show flat out who is and who isn't voting for the things the people want. It's hard for someone to say they are for a billionaire tax when they voted against it."
5-1-2-2-1-1,"Yup. Make the law as simple as possible, target situations where theres really no gray area and then force everyone to vote and ""declare"" where they stand on issues.Its incredibly easy to pretend that youre pro this or that, when youre never forced to put on record how you truly vote in an overt way."
5-1-2-2-2,"1,000%. Fuck, they do not make republicans do it either."
5-1-3,And somehow Republicans will convince half the electorate that Biden still raised their taxes.
5-1-3-1,The tax cut under TCJA expired - Biden raised my taxes /s
5-1-3-2,They will. It’s Trumps tax plan that we are stuck under until 2025. Taxes go up every year until then.
5-1-4,Still worth making them vote on it.
5-1-5,"Doesn't matter. Keep introducing legislation like this and let the legislature continue to fail to pass it and watch as the ""no"" voters increasingly lose their primaries."
5-2,"Well now, that sounds progressive."
5-2-1,Depends. A wealth tax would be the real deal.
5-2-1-1,This basically is a wealth tax. It’s a 20% on unrealized gains
5-2-1-1-1,Do they get a credit for unrealized losses?
5-2-1-1-1-1,One would think so.  Otherwise the stock market would instantly lose all funding from those who are in this new bracket.
5-2-1-1-1-1-1,"They'll want to keep making money even if it's taxed more, dragons gonna hoard."
5-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,"In an investment that has ups and downs, a 20% tax on unrealized gains would be a huuuuge bite.Good year, 30% in unrealized gains, you pay 6% of your whole portfolio in taxes.  Next year it drops back to the original price. You are out 2 years of time value and 6% of your money."
5-2-1-1-2,Where are you getting that from? The CNBC article says it's an income tax.
5-2-1-1-2-1,> this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the **unrealized income** of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations
5-2-1-1-2-1-1,Fucking finally
5-2-1-1-2-1-2,"All that means is that the unrealized income will trigger the tax, not that those funds are taxed."
5-2-1-1-2-1-2-1,"AKA, they are taxed upon their wealth, not their income or their withdrawals from their stock market portfolios, they will pay upon their entire wealth.  good."
5-2-1-1-2-1-2-2,This is a crappy article.  What triggers the tax is households meeting the minimum net wealth requirement not already paying 20% on their full income.  In that case they would be required to pay 20% on that same full income plus 20% of the change in their net wealth.*I’m wrong about the initial 20% threshold.  It seems that it’s 20% on full income plus change in wealth.  That explains why it’s a 20% rate which only applies to income up to ~$170k for head of household.
5-2-1-1-2-2,"> The White House plan would mandate billionaires to pay a tax rate of at least 20 percent on their full income, or the combination of traditional forms of wage income and whatever they may have made in unrealized gains, such as higher stock prices.from the wapo article"
5-2-1-1-2-3,"[WaPo covered it earlier today]Might be paywalled, and if so, you’ll have to take my word for it."
5-2-1-1-2-3-1,">“We still have questions of constitutionality. Can the IRS collect taxes if nothing has been sold based on the wealth, the property, of the taxpayers?” said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think thank.Oh my god, can you even *imagine* something so outlandish? A **property tax**?! I mean who ever heard of something like that??^/s"
5-2-1-1-2-3-1-1,"Haha, well technically there are some constitutional questions around wealth taxes at a federal level as opposed to state levelBut I’m a CPA and there’s already a lot of ways we tax unrealized gains constitutionally. I don’t think there would be any issue with this proposal"
5-2-1-1-2-3-2,Thankfully it’s only a 10 foot paywall and [easily scalable. ]
5-2-1-1-2-4,"The CNN article I read earlier said it applies to all income, including gains in stocks which don’t get taxed otherwise until they’re sold."
5-2-1-1-3,"No fucking way. This would require the wealthy to sell their equity in their own companies to pay their tax bill, thereby triggering realized gains, and potentially flooding the market with new shares driving down the price of their companies.Not a chance this is actually happens."
5-2-1-1-4,This will be a great way to discourage investment.
5-2-1-2,That's... what this is.
5-2-2,"It’s an election year, so it’s time for him to play the roll.  My money says he’s going to talk about it, and Congress people will run on it. Then they’ll drop it if (when?) they lose Congress. And if they win, they’ll negotiate it way down to like 5%, and maybe include a bunch of loopholes / alternatives.PS - I’m not trying to sound pessimistic. That just seems like the usual centrist Dem play at this point."
5-2-2-1,"Doesn't matter, every conversation and every step counts in a battle of inches. The new line is drawn and future dems will be expected to respect it."
5-2-2-1-1,"I agree with both points lol.That the conversation and expectation is important, but that of course Dems in leadership only propose shit like this when they know they can't get it."
5-2-2-2,> PS - I’m not trying to sound pessimistic. That just seems like the usual centrist Dem play at this point.Yeah because what are we gonna do about it? Vote R and fuck ourselves even harder?
5-2-2-2-1,Maybe vote in a primary once in a while. That would change something.
5-2-2-2-1-1,I've voted in every primary I could since I turned 18 in 2006.
5-2-2-3,“I’m elected I’ll make the teachers stop giving so much homework!”

5-3,"You could make $5,000 a day for 500 years and if you saved every penny you still wouldn't have a billion dollars. It's about time they started taxing the rich. I don't care of billionaires exist if poverty has been eliminated but that's not what has happened, poverty is increasing."
5-3-1,"It's a total of $912,500,000For those wondering"
5-3-1-1,Did you factor in leap years?

5-3-1-1-1-1,"I had to write a program to calculate this my first year of CS. Since then, every time someone says ""every four years"" I want to correct them. I don't correct them. But I want to."

5-3-1-1-1-1-2,"Every four years, you want to correct them, but every 100 years, you don't... but every 400, you do?Honestly, this include/exclude thingy always gets into my head like this and goes back to leap years every time."

5-3-1-1-1-2,"You can get the average expected amount if you started on any random year by changing the number of days to be 365 + 0.25 (1/4 of a day every year) - 0.01 (1/100 of a day every year) + 0.0025 (1/400 of a day every year)5000 \* 500 \* 365**.24925** = 913,123,125"
5-3-1-1-1-2-1,"This was the answer I was looking for. Came here to say, you can get damn close with 365.25 when calculating years."
5-3-1-1-1-2-1-1,"But DON'T FORGET, we will skip 2100. It won't be a leap year.DON'T GET COMPLACENT WITH YOUR POINT TWO FIVES. I swear, if I had a nickel."
5-3-1-1-1-2-2,"Or you could simply just overestimate to 366 days a year 366 * 500 * $5000 = $915,000,000 and see that is still not even close to a billion dollars."
5-3-1-1-1-3,"I love you. Regardless of whatever happens in your life, know that you matter and I love who you are."
5-3-1-1-1-4,Wow. I had to look that up. I had never heard about the skipping of leap years. I thought it was always every 4 years.
5-3-1-1-1-4-1,"Probably doesnt affect our lifetime because 2000 was divisible by 400, but 1900 and 2100 were not leap years. That's why most folk aren't aware."
5-3-1-1-1-5,Yes but did you factor the fact that Earth's rotation is slowing because of its relationship with our moon. Earth's days are getting longer by about 1.8 milliseconds per century.
5-3-1-1-1-5-1,"That's an incredibly negligent offset for any scale less than deep time (100,000yr+)"
5-3-2,I just want the taxes on the ultra rich to go back into necessary services for those less well off...rather than further bloating the defense budget and putting it all into private corporations.
5-3-2-1,I think a specific billionaire tax should be 100% allocated to a UBI system for redistribution purposes. Every year based on income tax you get a tapered UBI depending on your income and the state you live in (cost of living purposes) that is funded from the previous years collection of the billionaire tax. Everything is based on previous year data since all of the numbers will be calculated already.
5-3-3,"If you earned ten thousand dollars, every day, since the birth of christ (defined as Dec 25, 0000 for the sake of the math) you would still only be around the 340th richest person in the world."
5-3-3-1,Bezos has enough money to buy a million dollars worth of luxury cars and drive them off a cliff.Every single day.For 514 years straight.
5-3-3-1-2,Imagine winning the $100 million lotto. Every single Saturday. For 20 years.Still wouldnt have half as much as bezos or musk.
5-3-3-2,Are you factoring in compound interest? Or exponential growth? I guess that’s the only way to truly become a billionaire lol.
5-3-4,"Wealth is like gravity. It can be good thing. But when you get too much of it, you get a black hole.Edit to add:Wealth begets wealth. Things become cheaper when you have more money. For example, there a credit card that will give you 3% back on certain charges. But if you also invest $100k or more with that bank, you'll get 5% back.It makes sense. I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine. I'll give you more money back if you give us more of your money to make more money with.It makes sense, but it's still kinda messed up. The best opportunities for saving money are given to those who already have more than enough."
5-3-4-2,"Same with interest rates... loans from brokerages for instance (basically loans taken out on stocks held with them) will have their interest rates dramatically drop the more money you have/take out (Fidelity for instance, charges more than 8% interest for loans less than 25k, and just over 4% for loans > $1,000,000... also, spoilers, these sorts of loans are how rich people can have insane amounts of money without paying taxes on them for decades, iirc they also get to write off the interest payments on their taxes)"
5-3-4-2-1,> iirc they also get to write off the interest payments on their taxesPersonal loan payments aren't deductible.
5-3-4-3,"Capital is a lever. The more you have, the longer the lever, the more power it exerts"
5-3-4-4,> The best opportunities for saving money are given to those who already have more than enough.So very true. Someone with a track record of winning seems like a good bet.
5-3-4-5,Also taxes and fees. The poor pay a lot more than the rich relatively
5-3-5,"I care if they exist, even if none of us are poor.At a certain point it's no longer about poverty, and it becomes about power.Look at how much it costs to run for Senate or President in the US. And look at the class of people who become political leaders: the Bidens are multi millionaires (although many decades ago he grew up middle class), the Clintons are worth hundreds of millions, Trump was worth billions.Also:>billionaires exist>>poverty is increasingThese two things are directly related."
5-3-5-2,"Same. Largely because you *cannot* become a billionaire in a remotely ethical or moral way. At some point you *must* do some combination of the following: exploit workers, abuse workers, partake in slave labor, overcharge customers, skirt taxes, utilize unsafe practices, buy out or force out others in related areas.If you're a billionaire, unless you've somehow inherited it while also being entirely divorced from the source of the income, you're demonstrably a piece of shit.Edit: as pointed out by several (multiple times) there are exceptions to how one can become a billionaire. Then the morality comes down to how that person uses those billions once they have them."
5-3-5-2-1,"> If you're a billionaire, unless you've somehow inherited it while also being entirely divorced from the source of the income, you're demonstrably a piece of shit.About the only way I can think of for someone to be a billionaire without being a piece of crap is to win the lottery when it's super high and then just WSB YOLO it on options and hit it big."
5-3-5-2-2,"The fact that there are a lot of people in America and the west in general still believe that billionaires can exist ethically goes to show how indoctrinated we are to suit the purposes of the capital owners.To become a billionaire in net worth, you have to take a disproportionate share of the value generated by the workers and the market for yourself. There is no way to justify that ethically or morally, even if you own the company or companies."
5-3-5-2-3,"Even then you still wouldn’t get it ethically, as the money would be tainted. For money in those proportions it’s impossible to be earned fairly.It’s like a mirage that keeps people believing they can get there , when in fact almost all of us won’t even get close.Tax billionaires and corporations more."
5-3-5-2-4,JK Rowling became a billionaire by writing Harry Potter.
5-3-5-2-5,"You can set up a tech/fintech start-up and be valued a few billion a few years later.  In a low intrest environment, growth companies like these get skyhigh valuations. Not saying it's easy or common but there's nothing unethical about this."
5-3-5-3,Biden was literally *the* poorest Senator in the US for decades and famously took the subway from Delaware to DC and back during his entire term. Having over a million dollars in assets is not hard if you're 80 years old. And Clinton grew up in a house without electricity or running water. You could have picked better examples
5-4,Cue a herd of rednecks in trailers complaining about high taxes on the rich.
5-4-1,Only because they know that when they’re multi-billionaires that they won’t want to pay those taxes.smdh

5-4-1-1-4,Ill never forget how some republicans unironically agree with Fry's stupidly comedic statements lol
5-4-1-1-5,Such underrated humor. Here’s to the reboot delivering tons more zingers to help people wake up. We need it now more than ever.
5-4-1-2,"It's also like stockholm syndrome.I grew up in a rural town full of the 'rednecks in trailers', and they basically always were afraid that any inconvenience inflicted on the rich people that owned the major employer in town would cause them to fire people or shut down the plant."
5-4-1-2-1,"This is one reason manufacturing unions often have no teeth in towns where a company employs a large amount of said town.These companies make poor people thankful they provide any job at all, as if there is no alternative.Union members are scared to strike or negotiate for better wages/conditions.Politicians and their constituents often eat the corporate BS right up.Then those companies get further tax breaks and incentives to set up shop In a town/city as if they are a savior for that area.Incredibly frustrating to see average Joe's fangirling over the rich and the major corporations they own."
5-4-1-2-2,"This gets ignored a bit in these conversations, but it becomes a long term gain/short term suffer type thing.Even if they are aware enough to see that in the long run, this will help them, you're not wrong that employers tend to respond to these things by cutting costs in labor."
5-4-1-3,They’re afraid of trickle down taxes.
5-4-1-4,"It's more that they think that rich people won't deal with making less money, so they'll just increase prices to compensate for the lost money to taxes. They think if they billionaire gets taxed, they'll be in a worse position because things will get more expensive or they'll cut jobs."
5-4-1-4-1,"Jobs are based on demand.   Not cost.Price is based on supply and demand.Too many people don't get this.  Tax breaks don't create jobs and tax increases don't remove jobs. if there is no need for more jobs companies won't hire,   if they need jobs they will hire.  No one hires people they don't need.Even if you say tax breaks might make American jobs competitive with foreign labor,  sure but unless those tax breaks specifically prevent moving to foreign labor they will just do both.  Or as soon as the tax breaks expire move to cheaper labor."
5-4-1-4-1-1,giving to the poor -> the poor spend the money -> demand goes up -> there are more jobs -> more people start working -> republicans claim dem taxes are stealing all their money -> assistance goes down -> rich temporarily pocket extra money -> demand goes down as poor having nothing to spend -> jobs go down -> crime goes up -> republicans claim dem policies are causing more crime -> reps raise taxes on goods ( scheduling it to start after next election so if they lose they can blame the dems ) -> filter money to police to military surplus to military industry to political donations
5-4-1-4-1-1-1,I cannot wait to see a meme-ified version of this go viral

5-4-4,All while being completely oblivious to or perhaps even cheering on Rick Scott's GOP plan that would actually raise taxes on the middle class and poor.
5-4-4-1,"The GOP is in Alamo mode. They're going to acquire as much cash for their 1%  base as they can, while they keep the party conflict  ball rolling towards seccession. After seccession, they'll have maximized the public taxpayer grift, and set up in their seceded states, their politicians  can negotiate generous reunification terms."
5-4-4-1-1,"reunify? when it comes out how much money was going from blue to red states ala taxes, i wonder who will have the stronger hand at the bargaining table, if the blue states even want them back."
5-4-4-1-1-1,"We don't. We will ignore them, and watch them pull themselves by their bootstraps out of all the Natural disasters that hit Red States because no more Federal Help. They will beg to be let back in. We should force any returning state to wear Dunce caps at all times when in Public."
5-4-4-1-1-1-1,> We should force any returning state to wear Dunce caps at all times when in Public.Force them to undergo extensive re-education regarding things like LGBTQ rights.
5-4-4-1-1-1-2,"Also, if it's the red states seceding, we'll be spending the time with them gone passing all sorts of constitutional amendments getting the federal government to work how we want it to work."
5-4-4-1-1-2,"Even though it's going to be very painful I almost want this to happen if only for the cold hard iron shaft of reality they'd be getting in the butt. Everyone except red states knows any red state secession is going to be a tremendous disaster for the seceding state, and although them crawling back on their hands and knees begging to be readmitted to the union would be tremendously satisfying, it's just going to be a bad scene."
5-4-4-2,"I'm actually supportive of both. Why not have a sweden tier social democracy? Everyone pays more, and paying more is worth it if poverty is eliminated. It'd also utterly destroy the modern GOP regardless."
5-4-5,The investment that the wealthy have made in trickle down & hierarchy propaganda have really paid off.
5-4-5-1,I’m not gonna talk about how real “Trickle Down Economics” work but I just wanna say that is a dumb name to call something cos the word “trickle” implies very little is going to the rest of us and also sounds like the rich are peeing on us too.It’s such a bad name and people want to subscribe to that?
5-5,"Everyone seems to be missing this line:>As a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations,Taxing ""unrealized income"" is a radical departure from existing tax policy, not just a ""minimum tax"".Whether that's good or not will of course depend on people's political preferences and levels of economic understanding... but the whole article seems to be worded to obfuscate this."
5-5-1,How is it income if unrealized? And what happens if the gains are negative for a year?
5-5-1-1,"They borrow against it (equity or unsold shares) at nearly 0% rates until they die, which converts it to usable cash without taxes. Edit: and without losing the stock!Then there is a stepped-up basis for their heirs, so the income is never taxed.This is to capture that gigantic loophole that allows the incredibly rich to avoid paying taxes."
5-5-1-1-1,To me the best idea then is to get rid of the stepped-up basis.
5-5-1-1-1-1,I remember Biden orginally ran on that along with elimanating the lower long term tax rates for billionaires.  Not sure what happened to that plan.
5-5-1-1-1-1-1,Same thing that happened to legal Marijuana and student debt forgiveness.
5-5-1-1-1-1-1-2,And the public option
5-5-1-1-1-2,But that only solves half the problem.
5-5-1-1-2,how do they pay these loans back ?I'm just curious
5-5-1-1-2-1,They pay a sub-1% interest while the assets backing it up rising 10% annually.So each loan is based on successively smaller amount of those assets and with zero taxes paid.
5-5-1-1-3,Who lends them these sums at such low rates?That doesn't seem like good business
5-5-1-1-3-2,Bank will loan to billionaire owner of company X at near 0% interest rates using their stock as collateral.Coincidentally the bank just became the primary bank of company X. Billions of dollars are now flowing through the bank and the bank make millions off transaction fees.
5-5-1-1-3-3,.1% of 100 million is still 100k
5-5-1-1-3-4,"Say, elon musk has $20bil worth of shares. Totalling.. for the sake of argument,  15,000 shares. Now, thats no different than any other asset.So Elon goes to several banks a year and goes “ id like a $500mil loan please, use 100 of my shares as collateral.” Bank obviously does it,  & at the amount hes asking for the rates are like 1-3%. Elon knows that a loan is technically debt, so he doesnt have to pay taxes. Hes also aware that on average, his stocks growth is 7-10% a year. So when he does have to pay the loan back, it doesnt matter. Because if the rate is on the high end, he still made 4-7% on the current value of his stock.He goes to several banks a year, does this, and never has to pay any taxes."
5-5-1-1-4,Should just treat loans secured against an asset as a CGT assessment event for that asset.
5-5-1-1-4-1,"Seems like a pretty fair way to tackle the issue, though that’s also going to tank HLOCs."
5-5-1-1-4-1-1,Exempt primary residences then.
5-5-1-2,"> How is it income if unrealized?It isn't.It's like the time someone asked Warren Buffett how much money he had lost on a day that was a bloodbath for Berkshire, and he said ""None.  I haven't sold anything""."
5-5-1-2-1,It is though because just like currency that unrealized income can be used to trade for goods and services. That's basically the loop hole that every billionaire exploits.
5-5-1-3,"Buy $10,000 of stock.Stock increases to $40,000You now have $30,000 of unrealized profits."
5-5-1-3-1,"Still not income until you sell it.End of year. Pay tax on $10,000 gain. Week later it goes back to $30,000. You have no profit and yet out taxes on $10K."
5-5-2,"There was a good example in WSJ - 84 year old man bought home in ÇA for $2.5M years ago. Sold it for $10M and rolled it into land in Montana. Sold that for $15M and rolled that to buy commercial buildings. These commercials buildings are now worth $25M. When he dies, his heirs will not pay any tax due to the step up basis. So he has not paid any tax for any of the gains and neither would his heirs. This is the untaxed wealth ithat get pass down generations."
5-5-2-1,If it's not his primary residence he should be paying taxes on the capital gains when he sells those assets.
5-5-2-1-1,I believe they would have been classified as 1031 exchanges which wouldn't result in taxes on the gains since the proceeds were used to buy additional property held for investment.
5-5-3,">Taxing ""unrealized income"" is a radical departure from existing tax policy, not just a ""minimum tax"".Ah so you've never had your property taxes go up on a home you were living in and didnt sell?"

6-1-1-1,"Just yesterday I learned this MLK quote:""It’s a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps."""
6-1-1-1-1,"The original meaning of the phrase was that you need help from others, as it’s literally impossible to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. But like other phrases appropriated by the Right, it now means the opposite due to editing and incomplete context. Similarly to “just a few bad apples” won’t hurt. when the original phrase was “a few bad apples spoils the bunch”."
6-1-1-1-1-1,"The phrase most likely originates from a collection of 1700s tall tales about the fictional character Baron Münchhausen, who is known for claiming to have achieved plenty of ridiculous and impossible feats.In one story, Baron Münchhausen claims that he pulled himself out of a swamp by his own hair. In other versions it's his shoelaces or the mane of the horse he's sitting on.Münchhausen is a well-known literary figure in German speaking countries, often nicknamed *Lügenbaron* (baron of lies)."

They may be a taxed millionaire, but wouldn't reach a billion.Somebody fantasing about being a billionaire hate taxes or has no idea of the scale of numbers. That's like a child saying they ""want to be their own boss"" and then learn the hard way that owning a business is hard work too."

6-3-1-1-1-2,"historical calvinism is the secret sauce behind capitalism. it suggests that divinity/holyness (being en route to heaven) is predetermined and reflected in increased worldly success, rather than the other way around. that is, worldly success is the result of having inherently been holy from the start, and so can be used as a kind of yardstick for how ""good"" you are as a person. This takes money from being a means to an end to being the end in and of itself. all of a sudden, surplus wealth beyond practical utility becomes desirable.&#x200B;america's roots are deeply intwined with calvinism. the founding fathers talk about it.&#x200B;source: one of the landmark works by one of the fathers of modern sociology.

I could work harder or take on a part time job to fill the time I wasnt working. My GFs mom, who we live with, said I should apply for food stamps since I woukd quakify. I asked her why she thought it was ok I do that, but everyone else who does were bad people who are just mooching off the system.  I guess you can figure out her answer."
6-3-1-2-1-2,"It's main character syndrome. A person can only really know their own story, or at least the story they tell themselves. Personal shortcomings are excused by *circumstance*, and personal accomplishments, however meager, are achieved *in spite of* said circumstances. Whereas other people's shortcomings are a result of laziness and moral decay, and their ill gotten gains are some combination of luck and grift. Of course, everyone wants a happy ending to their story. The reward for all the years of toil and labor, and justice for all the indignities endured.

I am considering putting a white wallpaper over it all except maybe the wood veneer, but I don't know if it will work. the floral pattern in the bathroom is especially loud. It would probably still be visible under two coats of paint and a thick wallpaper.I say it's wallpaper, but it almost seems like the design is printed directly on the drywall.

6-3-4,"Starts with maybe around a third of the country being purposefully undereducated from birth by republican state legislatures working to gut our public education offering to create an ignorant, fearful population that's easily manipulated to act against their own interest.It's sustained by a social media engagement loop that hyper-efficiently delivers the exact propaganda required, exactly when people are most susceptible to its impacts.Ends with our for-profit health care system access being tied to employment as blackmail. Choice is to literally show up or risk bankruptcy and death with a single bout of illness or injury.The balance that the systems of power here work to strike is keeping enough people just distracted or comfortable enough to have something worth losing. And then trying to distract/divide us with fake cultural outrage.The only war is the class war."

They are the cultural vestigial tail that will always be around."
6-3-4-1-1,"You can absolutely influence that 1/3 by education.The thing is that when people say ""education has been gutted"" it's actually reached a point where it isn't education, it's just skill memorization school.You don't learn to think or how to learn, you just learn to copy/paste what you are being told.Average IQ in the US has been dropping for years now, which I believe is a 1st in the countries entire history.

6-4,"Here in Texas, they have a Vehicle Asset Test where your car’s value may prevent your eligibility for SNAP benefits.It appears to me that a similar Billionaire Wealth Test could be used to disqualify wealthy Americans from any and all tax breaks that are often used to suppress taxable income.Additionally, there is typically fuss over taxing unrealized gains, yet we don’t bat an eye at property taxes. My property tax is $9,000 this year on home appraised at $350k, of which I only own $110k equity in. That’s an 8% tax on my unrealized gains every year.

6-5-5,"This is technically true but it does obscure the truth of the matter. The top tax rate was indeed 91%, however the top 1% only paid an effective rate of around 42% after all was processed fully.The effective top 1% tax rate today is around 36.4%, meaning it has dropped, but by nowhere near as much as made out. Around a 5.6% drop.[Source]"
6-5-5-1,and it further obscures the point at hand by talking about *income tax*. No one earns billions worth of *income*.
6-5-5-1-1,"Worth mentioning that the the share of wealth produced by labor was greater in the past, which in effect means that more people were taxed. Even if tax rates were the same then and now, that alone would make things easier on everyone.I sincerely doubt taxation kept up with how capital is produced, otherwise we wouldn't have income/wealth inequalities reaching 1920s levels."

6-5-5-1-1-3-4,"the problem with this argument is that ""labor"" then gets arbitrarily defined and quantified."
6-5-5-1-2,"Which is the root of the issue here. You can propose a billionaire tax all you want but it won't matter if the billionaires declare 0 income for 5 years. We need to figure out how to tax unrealized assets without screwing over the middle/upper class. I'm not sure what the right idea is, someone smarter than me gotta figure it out."
6-5-5-1-2-1,"> We need to figure out how to tax unrealized assetsI can't say I agree. Taxing wealth, especially when it's not something like real estate, is very difficult and is likely to fail.What I think is better is to have a high inheritance tax on large inheritances."
6-5-5-1-2-2,"> We need to figure out how to tax unrealized assets without screwing over the middle/upper classBiden's billionaire minimum income tax calls for a 20% levy on households worth more than $100 million, applying to ""total income,"" including so-called unrealized capital gains, or asset growth."
6-5-5-1-2-2-1,"How will that work? All the unrealized gains everyone is talking about from 2020/2021 have taken a massive hit. Billionaires in the US lost collectively $660 billion in 2022. How do you tax someone on unrealized gains, when the very next year a huge chunk of those gains are wiped out? Do you give it back to them on their next tax return?"
6-5-5-2,42% to 36.4% isn't a 5.6% drop. It's a 13.3% drop.You're mixing up percentages and percentage points.
6-5-5-3,"[3] It is worth noting that, per the Piketty, Saez, and Zucman data, the tax rates of the top 0.1 and 0.01 percent of taxpayers have dropped substantially since the 1950s. The average tax rate on the 0.1 percent highest-income Americans was 50.6 percent in the 1950s, compared to 39.8 percent today. The average tax rate on the top 0.01 percent was 55.3 percent in the 1950s, compared to 40.8 percent today."
6-5-5-4,"There is one crucial difference, the ratio of wealth that was produced by labor vs everything else was much more in favor of labor.How that plays out today, I don't know; but given that both income and wealth inequality are starting to reach 1920s levels; I'd wager that the capitalist class is having it much easier now.Another consideration that might be the same issue, is that high-skilled labor can now actually be capitalists. A combination of making your money from both labor and investments.I think the real question is how is wealth that's produced by non-labor taxed and how effectively? That's probably hard to know."
6-5-5-5,You don't count all the fancy new tools the rich people have to hide their money into tax heavens. That's the real problem. They actually usually own very little of real money.It's all about shell companies.
6-5-5-5-1,"Then... go after those next?I, for one, am kinda sick of hearing variants of the idea that ""we can't fix everything everywhere forever in one fell swoop so therefore we should inject our thumbs firmly up our asses and do nothing.""Recently I heard someone say that in my office. And I work in an engineering office, where our whole existence is solving problems. If we adopted that same attitude, we would never do anything."

7-2-3-2-1,My loans are between Joe Biden and God now
7-3,"Also important to note that when payments do resume after the final pause ends on Dec 31st, repayments will be capped at 5% of your monthly income.  In some cases that can drastically change the minimum payment people have to pay each month.Edit: as others have pointed out the 5% is for undergrad only.  My mistake on leaving that part out.  And for those asking for a source I got it right from Biden's Twitter account.  It says 5% at the bottom of the image he posted."
7-3-1,And no interest accrues while making those payments.This is massively underlooked in reporting I'm seeing; it'll have a bigger impact on the economic reality of millions of families than simply cancelling a portion of debt.
7-3-1-2,This right here. I've been an attorney for 10 years. I make a pretty sizeable payment every single month. I owe more now than when I graduated. Great solution to the interest problem.
7-3-1-2-1,"How is that even possible? I'm not American, how do you owe more than when you got the loan, 10 years after you got it?"
7-3-1-2-1-1,Interest rates.
7-3-1-2-1-1-1,On a loan with zero liability.This is the really crux of the issue. The lenders are garenteed by the government of repayment and borrowers can't default. So then why is the interest even there?Interest on loans is supposed to be the lending fee for taking the risk and inflation. In this case there is not any risk but only inflation. So then why are student loan interest rates far higher than most other loans? Some of mine were as high as 8% before I refinanced.
7-3-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Why can a corporation borrow from the exact same pool of money, but be charged prime rate or slightly above while still having the ability to default, yet an American citizen (who help generate most that pool of money to begin with) must pay much higher levels of interest and still lose the ability to default except under the most extreme cases?It's a yoke designed to keep people chained."
7-3-2,THAT'S the lede. They need to tout that aspect big time. I think it also prevents the interest from being added to your balance as long as you're making payments. That's the huge thing. It was always the compounding interest that made it impossible to get the loans under control.
7-3-3,"That's a pretty f-in big deal.Debt cancellation is a problematic policy in a lot of ways, and is really just a band-aid over the core drivers of education expense, but that cap seems unambiguously good.Edit: And [no interest accrues] as long as minimum cap payments are on time. Wow."
7-3-3-1,"I feel the debt cancellation is just giving headlines, and that the IBR reform is the true meat of the plan. They REALLY need to hammer that home, because it's the single biggest reform to student loans in probably a generation."
7-3-3-1-1,"Yes! This is a game changer for future students. As long as minimum payments are made (down at 5%) then no interest will accrue, so the balance will actually go down! And extra money can be applied to have these paid off and will actually make a dent!"
7-3-3-1-2,"Agreed! It's not a complete fix to student loans, but it's a HUGE step in the right direction."
7-3-3-1-2-1,"It's basically all Biden can do on his own. He's already really stretching the authority he has with these moves, and it took a while for the WH and DoE lawyers to write up their legal reasonings for it.Congress can and should do more, but I'm perfectly happy with what Biden has done today."
7-3-3-2,The no interest detail is really the game changer. I know so many people who have paid a total equal to their full original loan amount and the total owed amount is still barely lowered.
7-3-3-2-1,"That’s the thing.  Government student loans were _never_ supposed to be a profit center.  This is true of a lot of government programs like these loans:  They should make enough to cover operations and the things they are meant to fund, not squeeze the population for all they are worth.This is why government exists and privatization is bad:  Private companies (even a lot of “non-profits”) are in it to make money, where government is in it to do the best it can to provide services to its people."
7-3-3-2-1-1,Yep.  Anyone I know that took out private loans for college is getting killed by them.  Federal loans help pay for tuition with low interest rates that private lenders would never offer.
7-3-3-2-1-1-2,My wife’s government loans range from 5-7% interest which is exorbitant. Private institutions offer 2-3% if you refinance.
7-3-3-2-1-2,"This is vaguely off-topic, but you reminded me of an infuriating story where recently I was sponsoring a local kid-focused charity org's eSports tournaments for their food and drink needs. I grew up a hungry child in a trailer park, so I wanted to make sure these middle/high schoolers could attend and compete without having to worry about food costs. The first event was a success, as I invited one of my chef friends to feed the kids and I paid his costs in full, letting us feed 100+ people at that event. I kept on waiting for an invite back... And waiting... And waiting...Finally, I do some digging on Facebook and find out they've been holding events. I show up to one and ask why they hadn't reached out or if there was something wrong with the catering last time. They straight up, no sense of irony/shame, tell me that they'd prefer to sell snacks to the children so that they can make money off of them. That was around a year ago and I still get so upset just thinking about it."
7-3-3-2-2,This is the best part of the decision to me. $10k cancellation wouldn't do much if someone in in the hole of interest slowly crawling back up to the $10k forgiven.
7-3-3-3,"Honestly the interest thing should always have been in place. These loans are incredibly predatory with their high rates, and target literal high schoolers (often just freshly tuning 18) looking for a way to go to college.If they had just implemented interest rate restrictions in the first place we wouldn’t all be in so much debt."
7-3-3-4,holy crap dark brandon?
7-3-3-4-1,He has risen!
7-3-3-4-2,r/DarkBrandon
7-4,"Hey, apparently you can [get a refund on any payments you made after the 2020 deferment began.]>You can get a refund for any payment (including auto-debit payments) you make during the payment pause (beginning March 13, 2020). Contact your loan servicer to request that your payment be refunded.Do it before the loan forgiveness goes into effect!Edit: It's unclear whether the refund would be reapplied to your existing federal loans (eligible for forgiveness) or if it'd be placed into a new private loan (ineligible for forgiveness), so definitely *first* clarify with your loan servicer, because the student aid website doesn't clarify!"
7-4-1,Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I just finished paying mine off on Monday lol. Wonder how it works because my borrower was changed from Myfedloan to Nelnet last month.
7-4-2,THANK YOU. I literally only had $9.5k and got it down to $8k since graduating in May thinking I was getting ahead of the curve.
7-4-3,Thank you for the link! It was exactly what I was looking for. So I guess I should contact myfedloan and just let them know I want to request a refund?
7-4-3-1,If they're still your loan servicer yes. Mine got transferred to Mohelo at the end of 2021 so I would contact them if this applied to me. Good luck!
7-4-3-1-1,I believe myfedloan is essentially no more so most likely transferred for them as well.
7-4-3-1-1-1,"I got a letter in the mail at the time. If you sign onto your FedLoan account, under Inbox>Account Related Letters, you'll be able to see the letter they sent and all the info you need to access that loan servicer account. Hope that helps!"
7-4-4,I was a dumbass and paid off my loans in full since it looked like the pause was going to end and I didn’t want to pay any interest. Anyone know if it would still be possible to get a refund?
7-4-4-1,It sounds like you will if the payments were made during the forbearance period
7-4-4-2,Can't hurt to call and ask. Personally I am waiting for the press conference this afternoon before I call to request a refund of my covid-era payments.
7-4-4-3,Just called they said no. This was fedloan.They said because I paid it off there’s no open account so they can’t refund.I am going to escalate.
7-4-4-3-1,The person I talked to initiated a refund for me. I paid my loan off a year ago
7-4-5,Sweet bearded Jesus I hope this is true.  I had a low five-figure student loan balance that I wanted to be rid of and used the majority of my savings to wipe it out in one fell swoop in May 2020.  Getting $10K back would be amazing.
7-5,Questions:1. When does this take effect?2. Do borrowers need to take active measures to qualify/implement the forgiveness?3. Does it apply to post-grad?
7-5-1,[Here's a bit more detail from the student aid website. Should be implemented before December 31st when the next pause is set to end.
7-5-1-1,Wow they've reworked the income driven repayments.Such that your interest won't just continue to increase the balance.
7-5-2,A more detailed announcement is set for 14:15 today
7-5-2-1,Shit. My clocks only go up to 12!
7-5-2-1-1,"Looks like your loans won't be forgiven! Sorry, bud."
7-5-2-1-1-2,Looks like he ain't got none of those loans to be forgiven if you catch my drift
7-5-2-1-2,Civilians don't get the fancy 24 clock!
7-5-2-1-3,This made me giggle
7-5-4,The most important questions as far as I'm concerned.
7-5-5,"I was reading up on this, a lot of it should be automatic like the extension and maybe the forgiveness if they have your income data, but they are supposed to set up an application to fill out soon that should help with that. Far as the post-grad I didn't see anything but I would check the dept of education site, they have a release on there."
8,President Biden Makes Surprise Visit to Ukraine
8-1,"Damn. All of Polish media was talking nearly 24/7 about his visit to Poland tomorrow, and the guy suddenly shows up in Ukraine"
8-1-1,"This was the perfect day to do it.  It may have been suspected later in the Europe trip, but coming early was definitely a surprise."
8-1-1-1,"I really don't think going later in the Europe trip would have ever been a possibility they properly considered.Putin is obsessed by dates, anniversaries etc, and the one year anniversary of the invasion is on Friday. I sincerely hope I'm wrong but it wouldn't surprise me at all to see things get worse in Kyiv in the next week or so as a result, and Biden's team will be aware of this - instead of making later arrangements and having to change these last minute, get it out of the way first and if it does get postponed, nobody will be any the wiser."
8-1-1-1-1,"On the other hand, if you want to make a deterrent against Putin trying anything, put the US president in Kyiv by surprise before Putin can whine about it, and dare him to have a go. Putin’s struggling to handle NATO hand-me-downs handed to Ukraine, he’s in no position to start a war with NATO proper by risking blowing up a US president.Also a gesture of solidarity that will not go unnoticed in Europe and in Ukraine in particular. Biden’s definitely taking a risk doing this, but the payoff diplomatically could be significant."
8-1-1-1-1-1,"Can you imagine the carnage if Russia were to do that tho? Putin would fight 3 wars, an internal one where half the population would come for his head bc of how idiotic that would be, his cabinet members and the rich coming for him, oh and of course the might of NATO coming to shred the entire govt and country apart. Kamala would come down hard AF too to set a precedent as a woman president. Wouldn't want to come off as soft. Biden is pulling a Leonidas in 300 move when he gets first summoned by Xerxes and everyone is like ""you know it's a trap right?"" And he's just like ""pray they're that stupid. Then all of Greece would go to war""."
8-1-1-1-1-1-1,"""We shall fight in our shades."" *points to aviators*"
8-1-1-1-1-1-1-2,"That's it, everyone go home, the internet is over for today. This dude has won it."
8-1-1-1-1-1-2,"“Go for it, you’ll be looking forward to the day we finally send you to Hell.”"
8-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,"I old, cranky, and don't give a fuck"
8-1-1-1-1-1-3,That three way front is already happening for Putin; all he has left is escalation until he wins or death. He can’t end this war and remain in power. He is in his life’s endgame and knows it. The question is how far gone his mind is when it comes to caring about the world he leaves behind.
8-1-1-1-1-1-3-1,That's a time in history I wouldn't want to be alivvv....wait....shit!
8-1-1-1-1-1-3-2,"The war is going just fine for the average russian. You obviously know different but that's because of two things:1 You have access to different information, not only what the russian state tells you2 You know you can openly dissent eithout fear of retaliation by the russian stateThose things make a world of difference"
8-1-1-1-1-1-3-3,"“Winning” the war militarily would still be a massive strategic defeat: bigger and stronger NATO, economy and trade broken for a generation, only China for a friend, 100k plus dead, massive skilled worker exodus. Master strategist"
8-1-1-1-1-1-3-4,"He appears to have convinced himself the West is going to implode on itself any second now.As far as what he thinks of blowing up the world, he gave an interview a few years back where he was asked about this. His answer, translated and paraphrased, was ""What good is the world to a Russian if there is no Russia in it?"" In other words, he believes it's entirely morally permissible to end the world in a scenario where Russia would collapse and disappear anyway."
8-1-1-1-1-1-3-5,I wonder if Putin has been made a secret offer where the US will make him “disappear” as long as he agrees to fuck off out of Russia and any public position forever.  It is exactly not what he deserves (a criminal trial along with his generals and higher cabinet) but could be the out he needs.
8-1-1-1-1-1-4,"> half the population would come for his head bc of how idiotic that would be, his cabinet members and the rich coming for himI sincerely doubt that unfortunately"
8-1-1-1-1-1-5,"For real. The conservatives will be like ""no one gets to kill our liberal presidents but us"""
8-1-1-1-1-1-5-1,They’ll say Biden faked his death and it’s a deep state plot to start a war
8-1-1-1-1-2,I doubt the US would be willing to use their president as a human shield to protect Kyiv
8-1-1-1-1-2-1,"We just did, and prob have a carrier group worth of air support with in 10 mins. US human shield brings US military."
8-1-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Just from a practical standpoint, it would be air support from allied bases in Europe. No point in sending a carrier into the back sea."
8-1-1-1-1-2-2,Hes there dude.
8-1-1-1-1-2-3,"Why? Not that I'm a huge fan of him but it's a strategic move you know the guy that explained the fuck around and find out graph? It's kind of like that, go head putin the amount of fucking around you do is directly correlated to how much you wanna find out"
8-1-1-1-2,"It could have been the most ballsy move by Biden to intentionally show up on the anniversary, with announcements that he was there.Daring Putin before the world to launch missiles at a city directly containing the US President."
8-1-1-1-3,But it's totally bad ass that President Biden and President Zelensky meet in Kyiv on President's Day.
8-1-1-2,That’s what she said.
8-1-1-2-1,Actually it’s never a surprise when I come early.
8-1-2,Pretty sure he went to Ukraine through Poland. So he was in Poland xd.
8-1-2-1,And he is going back to Poland tomorrow.
8-1-2-1-1,Wow two visits? Poland gonna be laughing at all the loser countries that only get one visit.
8-1-2-1-1-1,Watch N.Korea announce a missile test or something tomorrow. No one's visiting them at all.
8-1-2-1-1-1-1,> No one's visiting them at all.So sad. We should send Trump there as an ambassador. He seemed to like the place.
8-1-2-1-1-1-1-2,Maybe they could even keep him!
8-1-3,He can do both
8-1-3-1,The day is young!
8-1-5,"Yeah, it seems he made the surprise visit to Kyiv today and tomorrow as planned to Poland. At least this is what I understand."
8-2,"As a response, Putin visited another side of his table."
8-2-1,"Damn, these are some drastic measures. Let's hope he doesn't catch a cold from this long trip /s"
8-2-1-1,Probably took him a week to get there. With how long that table is and how short his legs are. Probably broke a high heel on the way.
8-2-1-1-2,He also had to put on a shirt bc it got chilly in the middle of the room
8-2-1-1-3,It’s tough to get around when you have to push someone out of every window you pass
8-2-2,Probably took him 3 hours to do so.
8-2-3,There was a bunch of posts yesterday about an uptick of Air Force recon planes flying on the polish/Ukrainian border yesterday
8-2-4,"> As a response, Putin visited another side of his table.That voyage took longer than Biden's train ride from Poland to Ukraine."
8-3,The logistics of getting the US president in to Kyiv safely has to be insane.
8-3-1,"The N.Y. Times says he took a train to Kyiv, which must have had the Secret Service in hysterics. Still, they probably couldn't risk flying in.I imagine that the Defense Department or the State Department—or even the White House itself—alerted Russia shortly before he crossed the border. Just to warn them off from conducting any air strikes they'd been planning today. The Russians do not want to kill President Biden, especially not by accident."
8-3-1-1,Damn I was picturing Air Force one pulling up with like 20 F22s as an escort
8-3-1-1-1,I wonder if the train the president is riding in adopts a special designation…like “Rail Engine One” or something.
8-3-1-1-1-1,Choo Choo One
8-3-1-1-1-1-1,Does this mean the VP rides in Choo Choo Two?
8-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,"But it goes by its security call sign, ""The Deuce"""
8-3-1-1-1-1-1-2,Bless you
8-3-1-1-1-1-1-3,Two Choo Two Furious
8-3-1-1-1-1-2,"If this isn't the correct answer, we riot."
8-3-1-1-1-1-2-1,"If it’s not called Choo Choo One, I send it back."
8-3-1-1-1-2,I like rail force one
8-3-1-1-1-2-1,I'm 98% sure there's porn with this titleIt features the Oral Office
8-3-1-1-1-3,Going by the precedent set by [Nixon's flight on a civilian-operated United Airlines plane while president]:  **Executive One.**
8-3-1-1-1-3-1,"> 13 first-class tickets at $217.64, and 12 coach tickets at $167.64woah only 50$ difference? I'd take first class any time then.(ok actually in today's equivalent it makes about 330$ difference, still relatively low compared to the difference between first and economy today)"
8-3-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Yeah isn't first and economy separated by, like, a magnitude nowadays? At least it was the last time I looked at an intercontinental flight."
8-3-1-1-1-4,"There used to be a presidential train, but now it's in museum."
8-3-1-1-1-5,It would be called Army One
8-3-1-1-1-5-1,bruh imagine an entire branch dedicated to trains lol. rail force one.
8-3-1-1-1-5-1-1,The Russians literally have that lol    Russian railroad forces
8-3-1-1-1-5-2,"President Franklin D. Roosevelt made extensive use of the railroad in his campaign in 1933, and traveled across the country during World War 2 aboard U.S. Car No. 1, a train composed of the Ferdinand Magellan executive car, a converted hospital car with high-tech radio gear installed for communications, a baggage car to carry the Sunshine Special and other support vehicles, and other cars to accommodate press and the secret service. Pictured [here] or [here]"
8-3-1-1-2,"Likely not f-22s in the air but they're probably ready, but looking at a flight tracker there's 7 military aircraft orbiting on Ukraine borders:In poland1. E3 Sentry - Awacs2. E3 Sentry - Awacs3. R135 - Reconnaissance4. K35 - TankerIn Romania5. KC3 - Tanker6. KC3 - Tanker7. P3 Orion - Sub killer but can be used for ground attack and reconLikely many smaller aircraft ready to run in with that many tankers up"
8-3-1-1-2-1,That’s the planes with transponders on and where flight tracker was given permission to show them AKA the planes NATO wants you to know about.
8-3-1-1-2-1-1,And with 2 Awacs and 2 tankers they for sure as hell want everyone to know they ain't playing
8-3-1-1-2-2,Every single one of those likely has several fighters with it with transponders off.
8-3-1-1-3,"I would imagine there are plenty of F-22s circling above the polish/Ukranian border as kinda reminder to Putin. Fuck around and find out reminder, you're getting your ass whooped by hand-me-down weapons that are 30 years old, you wanna try something a little newer?"
8-3-1-1-3-1,there's a fuck ton more than f-22s in the area
8-3-1-1-3-1-1,You don't need much else. Have you seen what they did to those balloons.
8-3-1-1-3-2,You want a stealth fighter to be seen?
8-3-1-1-3-2-2,"Well I mean if they’re ping two or three KC-130s, but nothing else their vodka soaked brains can still piece that together."
8-3-1-1-3-2-3,Russia has the capability to see our F-22s and F-35s. We attach radar reflective stuff to em when we want them to be seen. And they can probably see the KC-135s that are circling that we can also see on flightradar.
8-3-1-1-4,Oh they're there lol
8-3-1-1-5,Dark Brandon just takes the train into war torn cities.
8-3-1-2,I think almost any state visit to Ukraine in the last year has be done by rail from Poland.
8-3-1-3,No one flies in. Airspace has been closed all war. All the other Presidents and Prime Ministers take trains in as well.
8-3-1-4,Biden do love his trains!
8-3-1-4-2,Just not his rail workers!
8-3-1-4-2-1,"Are you talking about when Biden signed the bill that the House and Senate voted for? Presidents don’t make legislation.Btw, AOC voted for that bill. Strange that we don’t see progressives attack her for it."
8-3-1-4-2-1-1,It's worth noting that Democrats voted overwhelmingly for an amendment giving rail workers additional sick pay. The only reason it didn't pass is because Republicans blocked it.
8-3-1-4-2-1-1-2,Why argue with a potato head?
8-3-1-4-2-1-2,"People definitely criticised her for voting for it. It's worth noting that her vote was contingent on the passage of a second bill that would've granted additional sick leave. That bill failed in the Senate. Still, I think she deserves criticism as the sick leave had very slim chances of ever passing by itself.Also the Biden administration brokered the initial deal."
8-3-1-4-2-1-2-1,">her vote was contingent on the passage of a second bill that would've granted additional sick leave. That bill failed in the Senate.So what does that mean? When the Senate bill failed, her original vote was nullified?"
8-3-1-4-2-1-3,>  Strange that we don’t see progressives attack her for it.She was criticized heavily online for it the week it happened. People we're pissed.
8-3-1-4-2-1-4,People definitely criticized AOC for it. Don't be making shit up lol
8-3-1-4-2-1-5,Lmao literally every progressive was attacking AOC over that.
8-3-1-4-2-1-5-1,No way near to the extent that they attack Biden.
8-3-1-4-2-2,"Shit, I'm all pro dark Brandon, but this shit is true."
8-3-1-4-2-3,">Just not his rail workers!Context for ""Biden doesn't care about his rail workers""?"
8-3-1-4-2-3-1,The government passed back to work legislation recently to prevent a strike. I honestly don't know enough about the details to have a strong opinion on it.
8-3-1-4-2-3-1-1,He could have given them the paid days off which was what they were striking for
8-3-1-4-2-3-2,"A derailment happened in Ohio, and the GOP and Leftists  want it to be Bidens fault."
8-3-1-4-2-3-2-1,"Nope, they're referring to a law that passed with bipartisan support to force rail workers to return to work without sick days."
8-3-1-4-2-3-2-2,There were also accidents is Texas and South Carolina last week that didn't get as much coverage because the bick black plume of toxic waste from the accident in Ohio was still being talked about.
8-3-1-4-3,Amtrak Joe is now UZ Joe.
8-3-1-4-4,Reminds me of riding to work from Delaware for 30 years.
8-3-1-4-5,Choo chooooo!
8-3-1-5,I think that goes without saying for most other major power leaders. Russia has not dared tried to attack Kyiv with a leader of a major power there before and visits have been plentiful.Like when Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak visited Kyiv countless times in the past. I imagine the British government gave them a heads-up and Russia listened and banned any attacks on Kyiv for that day.
8-3-2,"Be a real bad time for anyone who'd try to fuck with the itinerary, I'll say that much."
8-3-2-1,"Like, say, driving around in an open topped car visiting hospitals after a grenade went off near the car earlier in the day and wounded one of their friends?Wait, that's Sarajevo"
8-3-2-2,They’d be NATO checkpoints at all entrances to the Kremlin by the end of the week if Russia tried anything while POTUS was in Ukraine.
8-3-3,"Definitely but also the US probably told Russia beforehand about it as a warning to not shell Kyiv for the day.The Us and Russia already share some intel about where some military presence is in order to avoid a event that would kill either of their personnel ([Example])As much tension as there is, the US and Russia both know killing the head of state of the other side is basically a guaranteed path to nuclear war"
8-3-3-1,"They did let russia know:""...national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that it notified Moscow of Biden’s visit to Kyiv shortly before his departure from Washington “for deconfliction purposes” in an effort to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict."""
8-3-3-1-1,> deconfliction purposesOnly a govt bureaucrat could have created that phrase
8-3-4,Meanwhile Putin is still hiding in his bunker
8-3-4-1,It’s really saying something that Putin has yet to visit the frontline.I mean it’s his war for crying out loud.
8-3-4-1-2,Best he can offer is various fake visits with the same actors playing soldiers/sailors/hospital workers.
8-3-4-2,That's fair. I don't think making a surprise visit to Kyiv would end well for Putin.
8-3-4-2-1,He tried to make a surprise visit to Kyiv this time last year. He thought it would only take a couple of days out of his schedule.
8-3-4-2-2,I feel like it would solve a lot of issues though!!
8-3-4-3,It’s not hard to hide the wee lad. Maybe is a match box or so ought to do it.
8-3-5,"I imagine painting “fucking try it” on the side of a pink unarmored unarmed helicopter would suffice.If that got shot down, there would be a lot of “finding out” being done by Russia over the next few weeks. A LOT."
8-3-5-1,"A couple buildings got knocked down in 2001, and for the next decade, like 1.2 trillion dollars in explosives was dropped on brown people."
8-3-5-1-1,We even dropped some on a neighboring country that wasn’t even involved!!
8-3-5-1-1-2,Just not Saudi Arabia. Where [15 of the 19 hijackers came from].
8-4,"Not so surprise for me as local.From 5 AM all railway and railway crossing were frozen and shut, while every 20 min trains with single railway carriage and diesel pull (not dependent on electricity) ware entering Kyiv."
8-4-1,"Yep, I got a breaking news notification 2h ago of downtown Kyiv being closed off in preparation of a potential arrival of Joe Biden. For sure many people were aware well in advance."
8-4-1-1,How many people scoffed at such a notification is my question? such a noncredible moment becoming credible.
8-4-1-1-1,"At least one! I heard that traffic shutdowns this morning was because of Biden visit and went like ""yeah right, you fucked up something and came up with dumbest excuse ever"""
8-4-1-1-1-1,"""Boss, we fucked up the rails! What do we do??""""F-fuck, tell them it's because biden is coming!""The thought of this conversation happening has me DYING."

8-4-1-1-1-1-1-1,"""exaaaactly, of cooourse he is, now go tell everyone who complains just like that"""
8-4-1-1-1-1-2,Just biden some time to come up with a better excuse.
8-4-1-1-1-2,"I read this comments in Ukrainian accent, and it was glorious."
8-4-1-1-1-3,Gotta remember this excuse for the next time im late for work.
8-4-1-1-1-4,I live in Atlanta and we shut down the entire length of one of the top five busiest highways in the US whenever the President comes to town. Its a real pain in the ass but I hope you’re all very proud of your accomplishments as a nation so far. Slava Ukraini <3
8-4-2,How much of a boost is this visit for the general public?
8-4-2-1,"Real big one, the only thing people post about today, meme channels are exploding as well (I'm Ukrainian)"
8-4-2-1-1,What's the Ukrainian reaction?
8-4-2-1-1-1,Overwhelmingly positive is an understatement
8-4-2-1-1-1-1,"I'm not surprised, they basically have the biggest implicit show of support from the strongest country right now with this move."
8-4-2-1-1-1-2,I’m so glad to hear that. We American citizens are rooting for your country.
8-4-2-1-2,Slava Ukraini 
8-4-2-2,"In an active war zone, a U.S. president visiting without U.S. troops on the ground, is virtually unheard of.Comparisons have been made to FDR and Churchill during the Blitz in WWII London.*"
8-4-2-2-1,Wait…there is not a marine detachment with the president right not just his secret service detail???
8-4-2-2-1-1,"Maybe, but those troops would be on the **train**, not on the ***ground**. Big important difference, if you're a lawyer."
8-4-2-2-1-1-1,"High-heel platform shoes, for diplomacy."
8-4-2-3,Look at it this way; Taiwan NEVER had a current US president visiting it. Nancy Pelosi last year was the highest ranking US official to go there. To have the US president visit in an official capacity is a major recognition of your nation.
8-4-2-4,Tremendous im sure. US been supporting ukraine and now the physical presence.
8-4-3,So didn't take the regular night train from Przemysl? And instead separate trains throughout the night bringing him and delegates?
8-4-3-1,I assume the individual trains were decoys (except one) - both to hide which one he was using and to make sure the route was clear.

9-1-1-1-1-1,"I'd imagine you're also familiar with Nixon's own goal, using more colorful (and despicable) language."
9-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Yeah he was, unfortunately, extremely successful at associating minorities with crime even more than they already were. It is an utter travesty that every time Black people gain some measure of relief (end of Civil War, Civil Rights) some asshole politician comes into power and does everything in their power to undo it by protecting systemic racism."
9-1-1-2,But where are the for-profit prisons going to get slaves they can force to work now?
9-1-2,I also don't smoke and agree 100%. I am so glad all of those stupid charges will be vacated and people freed. People are probably cheering in jail right now.
9-2,"for those asking:>The pardons will clear about 6,500 people who were convicted on federal charges of simple possession of marijuana from 1992 to 2021 and thousands more who were convicted of possession in the District of Columbia, officials said. Officials said the president would urge governors to follow his lead for people convicted on state charges of possession."
9-2-1,">Officials said the president would urge governors to follow his lead for people convicted on state charges of possession.I hope so. My record is sealed thanks to PA's new ""Clean Slate"" program, but I'd just rather have it pardoned and expunged."
9-2-1-1,"The state did a [big push last month where you could apply for a pardon]. The deadline passed, but if your charge was just possession, you can apply for an expedited pardon. It's extremely important that, if you want a pardon, you do this ASAP - Wolf will be out of office soon"
9-2-1-1-2,This is the first time I’m hearing of this! Calling my old attorney tomorrow. THANK YOU!
9-2-1-2,"Do criminal record entries not expire in the US? Over here (Germany), they simply expire after a set amount of years after the sentence was served (except life sentences and certain child molesting related sentences)."
9-2-1-2-1,"Nope. They stick with you for life in the US, unless you can go through an additional court process to get it expunged.It's a shitty way to give those in power another reason to discriminate. Since most jobs or housing ask if you have ever had any criminal record."
9-2-1-2-1-1,">Since most jobs or housing ask if you have ever had any criminal record.The crazy thing is, I've never been denied a job for my possession charge, and I have a good job. But I was denied applications at several apartment complexes when I first moved to Houston and was basically forced to settle in a shady area. I was lumped in with felons and sex offenders as far as the application was concerned because it was a drug charge. Didn't matter the drug, or the severity, just that it was a drug charge, PERIOD.EDIT: Oh! And at two of the places a DUI would not be a disqualifier. America!"
9-2-1-2-1-2,Crazy that the punishment persists after you've served your time. That really isn't right. There really aren't second-chances and it's no wonder why recidivism is worse than most other countries.
9-2-2,"> Officials said the president would urge governors to follow his lead for people convicted on state charges of possession.Translation:States that are blue will follow, states that are red will not."
9-2-2-1,"Red states might start voting blue if that's the case.  Like seriously, this is a big deal."
9-3,"Holy actual shit.People in hindsight will say this was inevitable, but I'm flabbergasted to see this actually happen. It's been *eight decades* coming.Encouraging Governors to issue pardons at the state level as well is huge too.e: [relevant]"
9-3-1,"And Beto just vowed to not only decriminalize it, **but make it legal AND expunge records in Texas if he wins.**[Some of these races might be a whole new ballgame now.**Get this out to everyone you can ASAP**, this is a HUGE deal in TX and could absolutely impact the race.**ALSO, YOU STILL HAVE UNTIL OCTOBER 11TH (Postmarked in mail) TO** [REGISTER TO VOTE!] **EARLY VOTING BEGINS OCTOBER 24th IF YOU ARE ALREADY REGISTERED!** [Be sure to double check!]"
9-3-1-2,"For context, the deadline to register to vote in Texas is less than a week away.Please make sure that you are registered by October 11th. If you aren't, you can get registered [here]. If you are, check to make sure it's still active [here.]"
9-3-2,Biden has accomplished more in just a couple of years than most presidents do in 8. Pretty fucking incredible low-key presidency honestly.
9-3-3,All the haters saying Biden wouldn't do this because he was part of the war on drugs like 3 decades ago...
9-3-3-1,That was before the dankness took hold of his soul.
9-3-3-1-1,Dank Brandon rises!
9-3-3-1-1-1,haha Dank Brandon

9-5-1,"Florida Republicans voted against a bill for aid to Florida.   When there is a hate, there is a way."
9-5-1-2,man i still just cant believe that shit. we need to keep the house and get x2 senators and maybe they can actually save this crumbling democracy
9-5-1-2-1,"It only gets saved if those bad people like those ones who voted against aid for people after a natural disaster, are permanently removed from power on all levels in the country entirely. Leave no room for them to recover."
10,Most Americans Don't Want Biden or Trump to Run Again: Poll
10-1,I think we want a lot of people to “not run again”.
10-1-1,"Unfortunately, I'm expecting yet another round of voting for ""least offensive senior citizen"""
10-2,And  guess who’s going to be running!?
10-2-1,George Burns?
10-2-1-1,Monty Burns.

10-2-3,AOC vs deSantis
10-2-3-1,Jon Stewart vs DeSantis
10-2-3-1-1,"My godDude had a crazy well paying job, left on top and used his money and time to open animal sanctuaries and fight for 9/11 first responders, he would do amazingly wellPlease let this happen"
10-2-3-1-1-2,"He's also incredibly intelligent, well versed in politics and will completely destroy anyone in a debate."
10-2-3-1-1-2-1,">will completely destroy anyone in a debateThat pretty much depends on whether you think ""winning a debate"" is decided by presenting better points, or talking louder and angrily. An unfortunate amount of people subscribe to the second philosophy."
10-2-3-1-1-2-1-1,I know right.  Who would think say following an elderly lady around on stage like you are literally about to strangle her would be seen as strong
10-2-3-1-1-2-2,"I'm not disagreeing with your hypothetical, but campaign trail debate is very different from pundit debate.Like how being an amazing home cook doesn't make you a professional chef.With that said, there aren't many professional chefs left for John to compete with, these days..."
10-2-3-1-1-3,I feel like hes also the man who got a lot of people in the 30-45 year old range in to politics. I would vote for that man in an instance.
10-2-3-1-1-3-1,Best part about being a fuck up student at University of Houston in the early 2000s was watching John Stewart in the lounge while my friend rolled a blunt in the men's room.
10-2-3-2,"i don't think AOC is ready, i'd like to see Katie Porter go for it."
10-2-3-2-1,I Love Katie Porter
10-2-3-2-1-1,I fuckin love Katie Porter!! I legit feel like the only people who don’t like her are the people who haven’t heard of her.
10-2-3-2-1-1-1,I’ve never heard of her and I’m definitely more in touch with politics than the average person
10-2-3-2-2,"I’ve heard of Representative Ocasio-Cortez, and I’m familiar with her policies and stances on the issues, but I have never heard of Katie Porter. Who is she?"
10-2-3-3,"This is the timeline I need.A young, intelligent sassy woman with great ideas against a watermelon who only knows right-wing buzzwords and talking points."
10-2-3-3-1,Unfortunately AOC would get crushed in a presidential race; we need her in Congress where she can affect actual change.
10-2-3-3-2,Have you seen AOC (national) approvals?
10-2-3-3-2-1,"Canadian here.I try not to follow American politics too closely but it's practically impossible to avoid.Through whatever various ""feeds"" I consume I have seen a tonne of vague criticism about AOC but every time I actually see her speak or get any details about anything she's done it seems to me like she's smart and tough but nothing comes off as particularly controversial or damning.Are there any unique criticisms of her or anything she's done besides supporting policies that are typical for left leaning politicians to support? Like I get that there are typical criticisms of typical left-ish policies, but what's so special about her that she attracts so much ire from so many?"
10-2-3-3-2-1-1,"My parents are both old school Republicans and HATE AOC viscerally. You would think she personally did something terrible to them with how much they hate her. But when I ask why, they have no answer. They say ‘I don’t like her policies’ but cannot name a single one beside the Green New Deal.She is the exact opposite of what Republicans think should run the government (as in, she isn’t an old, white man) and they hate her for it."
10-2-3-3-2-1-1-1,"The republicans have an incredibly effective communication machine.  They immediately saw her as a rising star and started the “anti” campaign against her.  If you can get a negative association in people’s heads, they can never recover."
10-2-3-3-2-2,Probably the same as national feelings on women and POC. What's sad is that she is absolutely on the side of every working person out there but many working people see the advancement of woman and POC as a loss for them.When everyone lives in a zero-sum game no one wins.
10-2-3-3-2-2-1,"It’s a shame yeah, because she is exactly what the US needs. Give her a solid team behind her and wonderful things would happen."
10-2-3-3-4,"I'm sure her 22% nationwide approval rating will gain her huge wins in CA and NY, while DeSantis wins every single other state."
10-2-3-3-4-4,Nobody in IL is voting for that clown and no the empty land down south doesn't count.
10-2-3-3-4-4-2,According to our antiquated electoral college the empty south is all that matters.
10-2-4,"This is just stupid.Let's say you get 100 people in a room together, 50 Dems and 50 Republicans.You ask the 50 Dems whether they want Trump to run, all 50 say no.You ask the 50 Republicans if they want Trump to run, only one says noResult - 51/100 people don't want him to run. Wow amazing a majority don't want him!Repeat for Biden with similar results.All of which tells you nothing since that's not how voting works.Unless you can get those 51 people to agree on who they prefer - which they obviously don't agree on a specific alternative - they don't have any kind of majority to select another specific choiceWhen you fill out a ballot, you don't get a picture of Biden's face with ""yes or no"" as choices.You select between him and one or several other specific people's names. That's the only kind of poll that even kind of matters.Show me a primary poll with Biden vs someone else and someone else leading."
10-3,Can we just get 2 people under 60 with moderate amount of intelligence ( maybe some political knowledge) please.
10-3-1,"Well, you are mostly going to get DeSantis as the GOP candidate. Unfortunately, I think he is quite intelligent. His policies are horrendous and appear idiotic, but I feel it’s all by design. He saw what worked for Trump and doubled down on it. While Trump was a narcissistic buffoon, DeSantis is more of an evil genius. He will play the role, and sell out 1/2 his population base without a second thought if it gets him what he wants.Edit - a typo"
10-3-1-1,">Unfortunately, I think he is quite intelligent.You don't end up with a JD from Harvard by being an idiot.Same with Cruz - he was apparently an exceptional student, despite being an asshole."
10-3-1-1-1,"I mean, plenty of rich people go to top tier schools by bribing their way in/using connections. Intelligence can be a way to get in by itself, but it doesn't work the other way around in that going to those schools is not necessarily a mark of intelligence."
10-3-1-1-1-2,Yup. Being good at school means you're good at school. Or have rich parents.
10-3-1-1-1-4,Yeah I thought we all kinda knew that the Ivy League schools were more about prestige and connections versus intelligence. I'm surprised to hear people think that.
10-3-1-1-2,You know who graduated at the top of Ted Cruz’s class? It wasn’t him or Josh Hawley…
10-3-1-1-2-1,"No, I don't, and Google isn't being particularly helpful."
10-3-1-1-2-1-1,Future Justice of the Supreme Court Ketanji Brown Jackson :)
10-3-1-1-2-1-1-2,"This is wrong. Cruz graduated in 1995, Jackson in 1996.Cruz also graduated with higher honors than Jackson."
10-3-3,So you're saying Hunter Biden and Ivanka Trump
10-3-3-1,I almost angry downvoted you because my reaction to those candidates as my choices was that visceral
10-3-3-1-2,I’d be down for a ban on dynasties. For every FDR there’s a Bush and I just really don’t want to deal with it anymore.
10-3-3-3,No to both of them. We don’t need anybody riding daddy’s coattails. No to Biden & Trump anything. How about someone under 60? Someone who doesn’t look like they should be wearing a sweatsuit & walking in a mall somewhere in Florida.
10-4,Each one of these guys would be well over 80 years old by the end of their term. What a joke.
10-4-1,Well Biden would be 81 and Trump would be 78 at the start of their term. Either way both of them would be over the average life expectancy for a male in the US. Could we maybe get a candidate who on average would still be expected to have a pulse.
10-4-1-1,"""Can we get a candidate that's you know... alive?""The fuckin bar is so low from horrible choices on both sides that we just want someone who isn't so old they have cognitive issues.That's sad."
10-4-1-2,"Wait, there's a fucking *3 year difference* and Trump supporters are saying Biden is too old and dementia ridden? Are you fucking kidding me?"
10-4-1-2-1,Well according to people I know trumps age is a lie. Somehow every source on his age ever is lying about him to make him older because reasons? Pictures of him at 30 years old in 1976? Fake. He’s young and has washboard abs according them.
10-4-1-2-2,And Biden blew him up in two debates.
11,"Biden rebukes the criticism that student-loan forgiveness is unfair, asks if it's fair for only multi-billion-dollar business owners to get tax breaks"
11-1,We have been “bailing out “ corporate America for the last fifteen years
11-1-1,40.  Reagan changed the game when he upset the whole economy.
11-1-1-1,>40.  Reagan changed the game when he upset the whole economy.People forget what Reagan actually did because of the 34 years of mythologizing that's been done about him since he left office.
11-1-1-1-1,"When you look at the peace and love 60s and 70s vs the greed is good 80s, Reagan really fucked America"
11-1-1-1-1-1,Reagan and the millions of peace and love boomers who elected him when they decided to abandon their principles for the almighty dollar.
11-1-1-1-1-1-1,"My parents were both born within five years of the start of the baby boom (in 1949).  When Reagan was first elected in 1980 they were all of 31 years old.  The youngest boomers weren't even twenty years old yet.Saying that baby boomers are responsible for Reagan is like saying that Millennials and Generation Z are responsible for Trump.  The political reality was much the same then as it is now - older people voted more, so they had outsized effects on policy.  It wasn't the boomers who got Reagan in, it was the people born before World War II started who did - just like it was people of that age who were predominantly in elected office at the time as well.I WILL admit I've met more than a few former peace and love boomers who somehow think Trump is pretty damn great, though.  But I've met more than a few who hate his fucking guts, too."
11-1-1-1-1-1-2,"As much as they're glamorized by the media, the ""peace and love boomers"" where part of the counter-culture, and where a minority of Americans.They didn't elect Reagan: The ""moral majority"" did.EDIT: And IMO the reason why the ""the hippies sold out"" narrative that was started and spread by the media in the first place was to attempt to discredit the 1960s counter culture as a whole in the eyes of History and future generations, with the intent to try to prevent another ""progressive rebellion"" from ever happening again, precisely because it was the single greatest threat to the ""establishment"" since the Civil War: The establishment is empowered by materialism and conflict, both internal and external, and the counter-culture was opposed to all of that."
11-1-1-1-1-2,"Peace and love in the 60s and 70s was a protest against the Vietnam war and Jim Crow, not the mainstream belief of how things should be.Reagan did fuck is, though. No argument there."
11-1-1-1-1-2-1,100% the peace and love movement was a counter-culture to what was the norm in the US
11-1-1-1-1-3,"I don't believe in religion.But theoretically Reagan and Thatcher are probably making a SIGNIFICANTLY asshole greedy power couple in Hell. Fuck both of them and what they did to the world; along with everyone that enabled it, wanted it and defend it."
11-1-1-1-1-4,"Being the shitbag Governor of California during the peace and love 60’s, Reagan already hated that generation and was sure to erase anything good about it."
11-1-1-1-1-5,I remember that the day Reagan got elected was the first time I saw my mom cry.
11-1-1-1-2,Yeah he was a major piece of shit. The world is a far worse place because of him.
11-1-1-1-2-2,My grandmother hated that mfer from when he was governor of California. He decided to close all mental health facilities and just throw all the residents out. He created the homeless problem single-handedly.
11-1-1-1-2-2-1,"I was in my 20s during Reagan's presidency (yes, I'm old) and I remember being infuriated when he decided to close the mental health facilities.  I knew what would happen and wasn't wrong.As an ex-Army, wilting, liberal flower I like wearing a t-shirt that says, ""Freedom is never more than one generation from extinction. - Ronald Reagan""  It's sold on the Grunt Style website and I agree with it 100% but it makes the far right people think they can talk to me about how the left is killing the country and they end up slack jawed when I don't agree with them."
11-1-1-2,"“Trickle down your economics on me, daddy” -Republicans"
11-1-1-2-1,I'll take 'Things that Trump said in the pee tape' for 1000.
11-1-1-2-2,It's time for trickle down economics to end.Long live PiDLCPoFR economics. (pouring it down like a cow pissing on a flat rock)
11-1-1-3,Reagan was political & cultural cancer: a forty year blight on our nation. The 1980 election was a total disaster for this country
11-1-1-3-1,Should've learned the lesson of not electing a celebrity as president
11-1-1-3-1-2,President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine would disagree.
11-1-1-3-2,"I believe 1980 election was the most consequential and important election since the end of WWII. Carter just could not match the humor and charisma of Reagan, and the electorate easily fell for Reagan's charm and his lies. I often wonder how different the world might have been if John Hinckley Jr. managed to assassinate him. Reagan's policies were short term success and long term disaster. That's his real legacy."
11-1-1-3-2-1,"Everything that could go wrong for Carter did. The botched Iran hostage rescue, a bruising primary against Ted Kennedy (ever since, the parties have learned never to challenge a sitting president for re-election), and guess what? Inflation was all over the news, reminding us of the upcoming election…"
11-1-1-3-2-2,Vietnam is when everything changed.  Both parties.
11-1-1-3-3,It was also manipulated with the October Surprise they pulled on President Carter.
11-1-1-4,"This has been my point of anger recently. Reagan fucked up our country by making American’s say, “fuck you, what about me?” That is the antithesis of American thinking. And what was Reagan’s campaign slogan? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.Edit: I believe in American capitalism in theory. But think about it in regards to a family game of Monopoly. It’s great because everyone has a chance to buy up property, but it would be a shit time if someone got a chance to make all the buys before you got to. There’s no winning.In the end, please stop being mad at other Americans. Be mad at your government. That’s the most American shit you could ever do."
11-1-2,Corporate America has been bailed out enough. They only ever use the money for stock buybacks and executive bonuses anyway.
11-1-2-1,"Any corporate bailout money should be tied to job creation. No corporate bailouts should be used to buy back stocks or hand out c level bonuses.And, if the corporation has no ability to create more jobs, like in the sketchy loan repackaging business, they should not recieve any money.If your company is hemorraging money, it is not the problem of the average citizen. And when your market is being a middle man, maybe that is a superfluous market.""Too big to fail"" is a misnomer. If your corporation is truely too big to fail, it should have a relatively stable market that is recession proof. If your business is so powerful that failure would impact the average person, your corporation should be broken up under anti-trust laws."
11-1-2-1-2,">Any corporate bailout money should be tied to job creation. No corporate bailouts should be used to buy back stocks or hand out c level bonuses.Why is corporate bailout even available anyway?If a company can't survive without help, then they should be selling stuff to government for the cheap, not getting  free ""bailout"""
11-1-2-1-3,I agree with everything you said there.  That absolutely should be a provision in any kind of government corporate assistance program.
11-1-2-1-3-1,"If a poor person trying to get unemployment or any of the other welfare programs has to file 12 pieces of paper at exact proper times, submit 3 letters of references from past employers or friends, and pass 5 background checks, just to get a check for $100, then a corporation should have to follow the same standards to get government bail outs.(slight exaggeration above, don't fact check me)"
11-1-2-1-4,Fuck there whole job creators bullshit. It’s not true and not how businesses work. We don’t need “job creation” we need business that are held responsible to its workers. We need businesses to pay workers based on the value they produce. We need businesses to treat workers as people and not machines.
11-1-3,"Privitized profits, socialized losses."
11-1-4,longer than that
11-1-4-1,Around the late 70s was when it really started Corperations started lobbying hard for power.Reagan just followed the money to far and sold the country out.
11-1-5,"At the rate the taxpayers subsidized airlines to buy back their own stock, everyone should have their own 737 by now."
11-2,Having a middle class who isn’t in debt for their entire lives paying off school loans is a good thing for a country’s prosperity.  But I’m sure the billionaires don’t like that and are going to tell their Fox News puppets to raise a stink.
11-2-1,"They literally want indentured serfs back, just you debt now belongs to a massive amount of lords you don't even know the name of. This was on purpose so that the new lords could get away with more without fear of uprising. This is the legacy of the French Revolution, back to square one, just slightly more complicated."
11-2-1-1,"> They literally want indentured serfs backdrowning in debt (student loans, credit cards, car payments)wed to your workplace (healthcare tied to your employer)paid the least amount possible (minimum wage is an arbitrary number disconnected from cost of living)terrified of speaking out (union busting, and belligerent police)and fearful of individual independence (no health autonomy, no public transit, no rent controls)I don’t want to be glib…but we’re not talking indentured servants anymore - we’re pre civil war slavery conditions now….just with enough extra steps people don’t seem to notice the inequality day to day."
11-2-1-1-1,"People might say 'you're exaggerating, slaves got beaten'. I remind them to watch what happens to protesters that don't follow orders."
11-2-1-1-1-1,Shit man shit. Amazon warehouses work people to death in the heat.
11-2-1-2,"The joke is on them, I won't be making them any more serfs.  They get real mad about that one.  ;)"
11-2-2,"Why would the billionaires object?  The federal government paying off student loans instead of capping interest rates or allowing student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy or requiring that repayment be limited to X times the original amount?  That doesn't take money away from billionaires.  It's just a handout, not a reform."
11-2-2-1,"Biden also changed the repayment so it caps at 5% of income and the balance can’t increase. Also, after 20 years of payments any remaining balance is forgiven."
11-2-2-1-1,Is it 5% of total income or disposable income?
11-2-2-1-1-1,Discretionary. It also raises the cap of what is considered nondiscretionary income. It is much more comprehensive than I thought tbh
11-2-2-1-1-1-1,Easily the best part of today's announcement.  Legit impressed and I've been critical of this admin for a minute
11-2-2-1-1-1-1-2,The more I heard the more I liked. The 5% cap (as far as I understand it right) is awesome. The 20 year nullification on payments? Am I getting that right? Loans can be paid back at 5% for 20 years and if you don't pay it off it's wiped off the ledger?I think we're going to keep hearing new ways as to how this order is great over the next few days.I've never had a college loan in my life. My mom paid for my (albeit cheaper) college (community college into state school). I KNOW I'm incredibly lucky. I am so happy for the 40 MILLION Americans this will possibly affect!
11-2-2-1-1-1-1-3,"Definitely. I have undergrad and law school student loans, and $10,000 would amount to less than 7% of my overall loan balance. The new income based repayment guidelines are just fucking huge for me."
11-2-2-1-2,For undergrad degrees don't forget that part.
11-2-2-1-3,It’s 10 years.
11-2-2-2,The billionaires object because debt relief makes people less desperate for work and makes the cost of labor higher as a result.
11-2-2-3,"Because allowing the public to prosper means they have an easier time being a human being.  What corporations want is for people to be shackled to their jobs forever barely scraping by so they have no reason to leave because if they do, they’d be homeless, bankrupt, etc."
11-2-2-4,It actually will put more money in businesses pocket because people will have more disposable income to spend
11-2-2-4-1,"That's what drives me wild about the criticism of this, from a purely economic perspective. It''s targeted at younger people square in their prime spending years. I was 30 once. Every penny I made went right back out the door, largely to businesses in town.This is a huge stimulus bill as well. But aimed at under-40s, a good chunk of whom will either have families or are looking to start families.Setting aside all the other positive benefits (and there are dozens, but I'm too lazy to list) this is just plain good stimulus spending."
11-2-2-4-1-1,"The only fear that sounds real is it adding to inflation, but I can't imagine this won't end whatever psuedo-recession we've been in lately. So stag-flation is the only fear?Idk, I just keep seeing/hearing temper tantrums of pundits and politicians who are all millionaires. Fuck them."
11-2-2-5,"This is facts. I was listening to an interview earlier on fox that estimated the cost of this around 2k per taxpayer (unverified by myself at this time).Of course we don’t know the long term economic effects, but as a friend said to me earlier, the people “recipients” voted this administration in. Only right they deliver at least something.I’m intrigued to see if this sets a precedent for cancellation going forward as the next group, and groups thereafter graduate college."
11-2-2-5-1,> cost of this around 2k per taxpayerProbably the best use of any 2k of my dollars in a long time. 
11-2-2-5-1-1,Certainly much better than when they used it to lob bombs in Iraq.
11-2-3,I wonder what would happen if billionaires ran out of middle class? Who would be left for them to frighten with warnings about the cannibal poor and working classes?
11-2-4,"> Having a middle class who isn’t in debt for their entire lives paying off school loans is a good thing for a country’s prosperity.Less debt = more economic mobility = less paycheck to paycheck living = employees who won't take shit from employers anymore.Outside of everything else - the hyper rich want employees to be at the mercy of the employer. They can pay people less, less turn-over, more profits, etc etc etc."
11-2-5,"But this doesn't solve that. The kids who are about to start school in a month are going to be in more debt than ever. Meanwhile the people who are now in their 40's and worked their asses off to pay off their loans over the last 20 years, the same people who are just now able to consider buying a house get a giant dildo up the ass. Especially because no everyone who just got their loan forgiven is now in the housing market. Yay price increases."
11-2-5-1,"FYI two more important aspects of the order are capping student loan payments to 5% of your monthly income, and also halting or lowering the interest accrued on the loans as well.  The media keeps glossing over these, but they'll arguably have a way larger impact than the $10k handout."
11-3,Is it fair that previous generations paid so much less for their education?
11-3-1,My grand dad worked weekends at a grocery store to get through medical school.Medical school.
11-3-1-1,"Damn, Saturday AND Sunday? He was on that grind!"
11-3-1-1-1,Well Sunday mornings and maybe a Saturday.  Look they needed to study and put down monoritiesb
11-3-1-1-1-1,Wonder how much the Sunday differential was in 1955? 8 years ago I got an extra 5c an hour. Now it probably doesn’t exist.
11-3-1-1-1-1-1,At Costco I get time and a half every Sunday. It's glorious.
11-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Isn't Costco actually a pretty good workplace, unlike other retail stores? I think they pay like $26/hr in my area, but you can live fairly comfortably on like $1k or $1.2k per month here."
11-3-1-1-1-2,Sunday?!?! The LORDS DAY?! Not a chance
11-3-1-2,My grandma grew up in Buffalo. The state of new york offered full-ride scholarships to any state colleges to anyone who graduated high school with a certain GPA. She had to pay room and board. $500
11-3-1-2-2,"Georgia has the HOPE scholarship that pays 80% tuition for a 3.0 GPA and 100% for a 3.7 GPA. I paid on average $500 a month for an apartment (with roommate, would have been more if I formed). Even with my extra scholarships, I ended up with $30k in debt at a state school. How is this fair??"
11-3-1-3,"Some little twerp tried to brag in a BNI meeting that he worked his way through school in a coal mine and incurred no debt, and said if he could do it then anyone could.      In a coal mine."
11-3-1-3-1,"Really? That’s insane. I’ve done engineering projects at mines before and I’ve seen how dangerous and hard the work is. (And have been exposed to it myself)Why the fuck would you want to encourage people to go work there? I have nothing but admiration for people in that field, but would never dream of encouraging people to join that line of work unless it’s a last resort."
11-3-1-3-2,"On one side of my family they were coal miners just a few generations ago, heard a story that was passed down to my grandpa about how they were so poor and desperate during prohibition my great great great~ grandpa spent what little money they had on raisins to home brew liquor to sell.Except his wife was strictly religious and caught him, and so they had literally no money and nothing but raisins to eat for months... Growing up relatively poor with a single parent it was still hard to even imagine that level of destitution.So fuck anyone who thinks coal mining is an even remotely good job, maybe they should go mine coal if it's so great. And I'd wager 99% of the people who actually got wealthy off coal mines certainly weren't doing the mining themselves, probably more nepotism getting unqualified kids jobs as managers and other BS."
11-3-1-4,What the absolute fuck. You can't be serious. I'm $400k+ in debt from undergrad plus med school
11-3-1-4-2,Same. I’ve talked to older and retired attendings who said med school was $1500 a semester lol. There’s just no comparison at all.
11-3-1-5,"When I went to a state school in the late 90s it was 10k per year for a full ride.  Full ride meaning credits + housing + 3 meals per day.  Even on minimum wage (5.05 an hour in my state) you could work and mostly pay for college.  Post grad, you could pay off any loans in a few years.My college is at least 2.5x that cost per year and minimum wage will not cover it.I make too much for loan forgiveness but good for those who will see some relief. The system is so broken its nice to see theres a bit of hope."
11-3-2,"One of my teachers in high school talked constantly about how she got into Berkeley with a 2.6gpa and made enough working part time to pay for her school in the 70’s.Hell, my dad and I have the same degree from the same state school school and he paid $256/quarter and I paid $3,000. He worked at a pizza restaurant and paid his tuition in full with a check every quarter."
11-3-2-2,I'm doing my Masters Degree at UCB. It's coming out to $20k a semester. I earn 90k a year and I'm going back to eating ramen noodles to pay for it.
11-3-2-3,Yes we are going backwards.  The loans make it easier for people to go to schools they can’t afford and that keeps tuition higher than it should be.  Lots of these private colleges are sitting on Tom’s of money.
11-3-3,Yes. And this generation should pay the same. It's not fair we pay so much more.
11-3-4,"Is it also fair that there was a generation pressured into going into collage without being presented other career paths? I remember being in high school and asked multiple times where I was going to collage. If I replied I didn’t know, the answer was always to apply to community collage until I “figured it out.” No other options were ever presented. People in thier 20’s/30’s don’t know what they want to do with thier life, so why should it be left to a high schooler to make such life changing decisions. I be happy for anyone/everyone to get all collage debt wiped out."
11-3-5,"They paid through their taxes, versus the whole burden being on the student all at once now."
11-4,"If I had to walk across broken glass to get to where I wanted to go, the first thing I’d want to do after getting there is to sweep the broken glass away so others wouldn’t have to do the same. Is that fair to me? No. But fairness is an illusion. We all start from different points and have different advantages and disadvantages. I want to live in a world where we we don’t obsess over what is ostensibly fair and instead we all try to clear the path for those behind us. Not because it is fair, but because it is right."
11-4-1,It's called empathy and is unfortunately a rare thing these days.
11-4-1-2,"I'm a full grown adult and I'm still grappling w/ the realization that like a good 30+ percent of the country is certifiably narcissistic (as in Narcissistic Personality Disorder)> Narcissistic personality disorder is found more commonly in men. The cause is unknown but likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors.> Symptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism, and a sense of entitlement."
11-4-2,“A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit.”
11-4-2-1,Precisely.
11-4-3,"Ignore them, your words are inspiring. I am inspired."
11-4-4,"I fully agree. I am about to pay off my remaining $10k balance that peaked at $273k. I sacrificed a lot to pay down my balance while also joining the army national guard on a loan repayment program. Does this make me spiteful over todays announcement? Absolutely not, after being screwed over dealing with the education system and going through hell to be where I’m at (not that previous generations had to work this hard to be where I’m at) I would never want someone behind me to go through the same. Let the haters hate, their arguments are full of hypocrisy."
11-4-5,"Dang, that's really well put."
11-5,Republicans are consistent. They don't give a shit about anyone but the wealthy and they don't try to hide it.
11-5-1,Which is ironic because the majority of the  republican voting base are the exact opposite.
11-5-1-1,"Republicans are literally Fry when Nixon runs for re-electionNixon - I promise to cut taxes for the rich, and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel!Fry -  Yeah! That'll show those poor!Leela - Why are you cheering Fry, you aren't richFry - True, but someday I might be rich, and then people like me better watch their step[Bad video source]"
11-5-1-1-2,"Yes, like Fry...like Fry!["
11-5-1-2,The right wing media has them so brainwashed that they can't think for themselves anymore.
11-5-1-2-1,"It's been worrying for years, some right-wing parroting of whatever the talking fox heads have said recently, and any refutations are met with more rhetoric, blatant attacks, or complete disengagement.The GOP is (at least was) basically just Akira with trump as the face. How did they kill Akira again?"
11-5-1-3,That’s why they have infused their politics with evangelical Christianity - to convince the lower class to throw themselves on their swords for the rich because that is “God’s will.”
11-5-2,"To be fair, they are very anti-education.  This policy has helped them time after time in the elections."
12,Biden endorses bill to disclose super PAC donors: ‘Dark money erodes’ trust
12-1,We absolutely need this.Who is going to oppose it and why?  (rhetorical question)
12-1-1,"Republicans will oppose it because it destroys their ""deep state"" narrative and will show they receive most dark money."
12-1-1-1,">Republicans will oppose it because ~~it destroys their ""deep state"" narrative and will show they receive most dark money.~~ they can no longer take Russian money without being exposed."
12-1-1-1-1,"Republicans will oppose it because their donors fucking tell them to, full stop."
12-1-1-1-1-2,Only the donors we don't know about.
12-1-1-1-2,"Everything comes through a trust, then."
12-1-1-1-2-1,Who are the trutee's then. We can play this game all day cowboy!
12-1-1-1-2-1-1,Three more trusts.
12-1-1-1-2-1-1-2,It's trusts all the way down.
12-1-1-1-2-1-1-3,Then have two trustTrust win every time
12-1-1-1-2-1-1-4,…. Stacked on top of each other in a trench coat
12-1-1-1-2-1-1-5,"Easy enough, what else? Money always leaves a trail. It's easy enough to follow if you have the correct tools."
12-1-1-1-2-2,"I never, ever understand this kind of nitpicking like passing legislation is a totally fruitless endeavor.Will people try to find a way around the law? Absolutely, but we can certainly make the bastards work for it.You see a similar line when it comes to other laws so I'm not just picking on OP as people will point to a loophole in a law as if that somehow invalidates the purpose of the law entirely.No single law is going to be insurmountable, but that doesn't mean we have to give these assholes a layup when it comes to committing their crimes."
12-1-1-1-2-2-2,I think many are just venting by expressing their cynicism
12-1-1-1-2-2-3,"I agree. The process of legislating and ruling is an ongoing one, because humanity is dynamic.There is no single ""state of perfection"" for government or law, because there will always be those that wish to subvert it. Additionally, there will never be a ""state of perfection"" in government or law because the human condition change. Technology changes, our culture, our norms, and our needs change over time, and require changes in the law to address those things.To refuse legislation because it will soon be subverted or outdated is not reasonable. If you are a legislator, if you are a leader, you need to engage in the process of leading."
12-1-1-1-2-2-4,If you have a law against it then all it takes is five years and the loopholes become so tight that you can literally identify who is committing fraud simply because they used the loophole in the first place.
12-1-1-1-2-2-5,The law can’t be about donors showing their identity. It has to be about the recipient demonstrating the identity.
12-1-1-1-2-3,Blind trust. We don't know who. It's good though! - GOP
12-1-1-1-2-3-1,"Then that’s dark money and illegal. All donors must be disclosed, if you cannot disclose said donors, that money cannot legally be accepted."
12-1-1-1-4,It’s not just Russian money though. And it’s not just Republicans taking dark money either.
12-1-1-1-5,">>~~Republicans~~ Most politicians will oppose it because ~~it destroys their ""deep state"" narrative and will show they receive most dark money.~~ they can no longer take ~~Russian~~ Coporate interest money at the expense of the average voters interests without being exposed."
12-1-1-2,"Some Democrats may oppose it as well.Whoever opposes it has something to hide, as individuals. Could be Republican, or Democrat alike.Whoever opposes it, takes money they don't want their voters to know about. Simple as that.Everyone should agree on that. Democrats and Republicans alike.So, let's see who votes for what then.Many would accuse others of having to hide this information. Surely all of those people will vote to expose their rivals, and clear themselves of any doubt of wrongdoing."
12-1-1-2-1,"Put it to a vote. You're right, the votes will speak way more than whatever words try to justify it. Don't give a shit about parties"
12-1-1-2-2,"Logically no one should oppose this as they can always claim ignorance of where the money came from in the past.Realistically, I fully expect more than a few knuckleheads will oppose this to try and keep the gravy train rolling."
12-1-1-2-4,"I'm looking forward to tracing these ridiculous mud slinging ads to the people responsible. Democrats, and Republicans. I also have a feeling we're going to be surprised by where some of them come from."
12-1-1-2-4-1,I don't think we'll be surprised. The law is necessary. It needs to be drafted well. What's gonna happen is they're gonna start trying to find ways to launder the dirty money first.But it's better that than to make it legal to hide your sources.
12-1-1-2-4-1-1,I agree with your point.
12-1-1-3,And the sheep will somehow agree with it.
12-1-1-3-2,"Well yea, it will get framed as an us vs them issue. Or, this will hurt them and help us issue. There is nothing in that realm that cannot be excused, ever, for any reason. It's literally most of their identity."
12-1-1-3-3,"The sheep will be on PoliticalCompassMemes posting ""both sides are just as bad as each other except Republicans actually are good"" like always."
12-1-1-4,These people are openly lying to their constituents because they know they don’t bother to research. Do you think they actually care at this point?
12-1-1-5,"Hate to say it but, there may be democrats against it too."
12-1-1-5-1,What's this hate to say it nonsense.Vote out all the trash.Turn on the lights.Who cares what imaginary letter is next to their name.
12-1-1-5-2,"Definitely. They wont be collecting anywhere near what the Right has been, but it'll be 10 times more damaging to a Democrat.When that disgusting fucking moron Gohmert has to disclose that he's bought and sold, no one will be shocked at all and he won't lose one vote. No one smart enough to care was voting him in anyway.But imagine if, say, Katie Porter ended up taking in 1/5th as much Dark Money from say... a coal lobbyist. She'd be ruined. (I firmly believe Porter would never be involved in Dark Money and is 100% clean, but she draws a good contrast for precisely that reason)."
12-1-1-5-2-1,"Yeah, it really comes down to once again that leftists have actual values, and the GOP does not. The left is willing to immediately abandon a politician if they believe they have transgressed, but a Republican can literally be a pedophile, rapist, cheat who commits every kind of fraud imaginable, but as long as they have that magic R, that’s what matters"
12-1-1-5-2-1-1,pretty good example of this is Al Franken
12-1-1-5-2-1-2,"Instead of saying ‘leftists’ and ‘the left’ when referring to party values, why not just say Democrats? Especially when using ‘GOP’ and ‘Republican’ to describe those on the other side?Democrats are not really ‘leftists’, and certainly aren’t when considering global politics and policy."
12-1-1-5-2-2,>Katie PorterI would love to see her run for president.
12-1-1-5-2-3,"If the politician takes the money but by all reports is still acting ethically, then who cares?  If Exxon gave Bernie a billion dollars, I'd say take the money and do good with it as long as he continues to do what he does."
12-1-1-5-2-3-1,"And that's why Exxon WON'T give Bernie a billion dollars. They only give money to people who agree to represent them in Congress, under a bad-faith disguise of representing ""the people"""
12-1-1-5-2-4,"This law would apply to PACs not individual candidates or their campaigns. PACs are not supposed to coordinate with candidates, although I'm sure they do."
12-1-1-5-2-5,Loser Hilary raised more money but still lost to idiot Trump.
12-1-1-5-2-5-2,Twice as much.
12-1-1-5-3,That’s why you vote out the ones against it.
12-1-1-5-4,"All Republicans will be against it, and some Democrats will be against it. The only people from either major party who ever speak up for things like this are Democrats. You’re technically right but that’s pretty misleading too."
12-1-1-5-5,I'd bet my house that Democrats receive an incredibly small fraction of what Republicans receive.
12-1-2,The supreme court already ruled a similar California law [unconstitutional]. Corporations have the right to privacy we don't.This is why we need to support the [Restore Democracy Amendment] to get foreign/corporate dark money out of US politics.
12-1-2-1,"I remember in 1992 it was big news that Clinton spent about $100 million on his campaign. The most ever spent on a presidential campaign.  Inflation calculator puts that at about $211 million today.W. Bush spent about the same in 2000.Since Citizens United passed presidential campaigns now cost well over a billion and all the lower seats spend quadruple (adjusted for inflation) what they used to spend on campaigns.The final price tag for the 2016 election is **$6.5 billion** for the presidential and congressional elections combined, according to [campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org.]That's what the Citizens United ruling did to us and it's bad."
12-1-2-1-2,">The final price tag for the 2016 election is **$6.5 billion** for the presidential and congressional elections combined, according to [campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org.]>>That's what the Citizens United ruling did to us and it's bad.I wonder if that counts the spending from Fox and other outlets that were acting as unofficial arms of the trump campaign?"
12-1-2-1-3,"I think this is why Trump ran in the first place, and why he keeps forever campaigning.  It's just free money for him."
12-1-2-1-4,Why are you comparing one presidential campaign cost to the cost of all campaigns 20+ years later and then saying it’s bad as if we can’t make our own minds about it?
12-1-2-1-4-1,> Why are you comparing one presidential campaign cost to the cost of all campaigns 20+ years later and then saying it’s bad as if we can’t make our own minds about it?What's bad is today we have 724 billionaires in the USA that use our elections like a personal game of SIMS for shits & giggles.   Because they can.
12-1-2-1-5,The US GDP in 2020 was 20.94 trillion. Compare that to 6.52 trillion in 1992 and the situation seems roughly in line with what you'd expect as the country gets richer.The amount we spend on elections is a rounding error. The real problem is that voters have real disagreements and are generally uninformed because the world has gotten way too freaking complicated. Unfortunately those problems have no obvious solutions and attempted solutions can backfire. See the last 6 years of attempting to inform Republicans of basic facts of reality. We're deep in this hole.
12-1-2-1-5-2,"> The US GDP in 2020 was 20.94 trillion. Compare that to 6.52 trillion in 1992 and the situation seems roughly in line with what you'd expect as the country gets richer.Mathematically, no. You're actually WAY off.20.94 Trillion / 6.52 Trillion = 321.16% increase in GPD6.5 Billion / 100 Million = 6500% increase in campaign spendingEDIT: Misread above, consider one campaign to be $1 Billion and it's:1 Billion / 100 Million = 1000% increase in campaign spending"
12-1-2-2,The main users of dark money aren't corporations but rich individuals.
12-1-2-2-1,I’m going to make a shot in the dark here.But the main source of money for rich individuals… Is corporations
12-1-2-3,"I get the ""money is speech"" argument even if I don't agree, but how isn't it ok to force politicians to disclose their benefactors?"
12-1-2-3-1,People will make up judicial philosophies to further their favored political strategy. Honestly the courts just made it up since congress is deadlocked.
12-1-2-3-2,"(A) It's not that money is speech, it's that if you regulate money spent on the exercise of a right, you regulate the underlying right. Imagine a law stating no one could spend money on any good or service used in furtherance of a same-sex marriage. It's not banning the marriage itself, but by prohibiting spending money on it you're making the exercise of that right much harder.(B) The Citizens United decision actually goes into quite a bit of discussion about how donor disclosure laws are not only constitutional but actually necessary for voters to make informed decisions about the speech that they're exposed to."
12-1-2-3-3,"""Money is speech"" is not a sound argument in the first place. But that aside, the core arguments from conservatives were that they knew that who/what they were donating money to was unpopular, and if it had to be disclosed it would negatively impact their ""reputations"" as people found out about all the shit they sponsored. That potential reputational harm was ""chilling"" their free speech, therefore the government has to step in and ensure that they can donate in secret so their reputations aren't hurt.Its such fucking bullshit. Actions have consequences. If you are supporting/funding anti-democracy and anti-human rights candidates then you should have to face any ""consequences"" that come from it, even though all that happens is people would realize how much of a shithole you are"
12-1-3,The biggest dark money campaign going on in Texas right now.  Who is going to oppose it and why?  Rich people who want to have excess control in elections.
12-1-3-1," While I literally cheered the first time I saw the ads from this campaign, I also absolutely abhor the fact that the funding for it is being hidden behind a shady LLC.I tried to look up who/what group was behind it out of curiosity last night and ran into articles like the one you linked. Not happy about that at all."
12-1-3-1-1,"Agree.  I think that ad campaign would be totally fair game for Beto to use and endorse.  It is a powerful ad.But people shouldn't pretend that dark money campaigns are monopolized by one political party.  They are funded by rich people who often really don't give a shit about anything in the ad itself, they care about nothing more than getting the laws passed that benefit their pocketbook."
12-1-4,"Who would be against this? Oh yeah, the fascist party needs to hide their donors from being exposed as fascist."
12-1-4-1,"Coincidentally, funny how Russia being busy with a war and their easy means of funneling money through the NRA getting shut off coincided with the republicans having a ton of issues raising money."
12-1-4-1-2,"I also thought it was funny as hell when the conservative subreddit mods were like ""Where did 1/3 of our posters go?! They all just suddenly dropped off as soon as the Russian war with Ukraine started! What possibly could have happened?!"""
12-1-4-1-2-1,Yep and Reddit management was always able to see the truth and continues to do nothing to stop it.
12-1-4-1-2-2,"Source?(I would love to see something concrete on this, as I believe it to be true, but would just like something to back it up)"
12-1-4-2,"Democrats will oppose this too. Just because they’re pro-democracy doesn’t mean they’re anti-corporation. They’re the lesser evil, but it’s important to remember they’re evil."
12-1-4-2-1,They opposed it earlier this month when they shot down in the DNC a proposal to ban dark money spending in all Dem primaries. It’s no coincidence that Biden was silent when his endorsement might have made a difference and he was the recipient of millions upon millions in dark money in the 2020 primary and general.
12-1-5,Many politicians will and they'll refuse to give reason. Corporate interest controls our nation.
12-1-5-1,>Corporate interest controls our nation.If it were that simple the problem wouldn't be as bad as it is.There are 724 billionaires in the USA and many of them get off on the power to control the US gov for personal reasons.   Just because they can.Of course corporations want to make as much profit as possible but they know they need a healthy country of consumers to buy whatever they are selling.For a lot of those billionaire donors it's just personal.
12-1-5-2,I was playing Horizon Zero Dawn and in the game you're basically traversing the world hundreds/thousands of years after the machine apocalypse but you find random snips of what was going on in daily life before it all went to hell. One was about a Supreme Court ruling in 2063 allowing corporations to run for office by proxy and that's when the game got a bit too real for me lol...Reading about Biden endorsing this bill reminded me that our reality could potentially reach that dystopian future if we don't make changes.
12-1-5-2-1,"Ooh, wait until you find about how the robopocalypse happened."
12-1-5-2-1-2,"Ah fuck, ok. I bet there's gonna be more real life parallels/potential future scenarios..."
12-2,dark money is strangling democracy. Everyone needs to show exactly who is paying for whom.
12-2-1,Dark money funded several Supreme Court justices.
12-2-1-1,Which is why it will be strangled in the crib.
12-2-1-1-2,It's not gonna make it to the crib. It's gonna get aborted.
12-2-1-2,"The whole ""Deep State"" argument that Conservatives make is really just an admission of guilt.The Murdoch family, the Heritage Foundation, and Sinclair broadcasting have working to strangle media, the courts, and government."
12-2-1-2-1,And the Federalist Society.
12-2-1-2-2,Every accusation from Republicans is a confession. I wonder who the Satanic pedophiles are: McConnel? Cruz?
12-2-1-2-2-1,"It’s Cruz. It’s 100% Cruz. I have no evidence of this, but I am 100% certain that I am correct."
12-2-1-2-2-1-2,Ted Cruz the Zodiac Killer?  I'd believe it.
12-2-1-2-3,Don't forget the Koch brothers.  Dark Money by Jane Mayer was a really good read.
12-2-1-2-4,Know anything about Nexstar Media? They just bought out my beloved local News channel and I wonder what Nexstar’s stance is.
12-2-1-2-5,"Projection, plain and simple."
12-2-1-3,I want to know who paid Kavanaugh's debt.
12-2-1-4,"it is not Dark money, i heard that TripLite CEO basically donated the whole company /wealth to a super PAC, little more that a $1B, and they used that money for Supreme Court justice confirmation and lot of federal judges. TripLite was purchased by some US company.So all $1B was tax free."
12-2-1-5,Lol and THOUSANDS of state and district judges. The courts are turbo fucked. Pretty much the only thing we can do at this point is expand the courts (which it needs anyways because it's operating far over capacity as is)

12-3,"This would be a huge win for the American people, however it's going to take a lot of changes to get money out of politics which should be the ultimate goal."
12-3-1,"California tried something similar and it was struck down by the SC. I wouldn't hold my breath on this law surviving challenges, if it even passes a Congressional vote."
12-3-1-1,"Which is why we need an amendment to the constitution, and given how much agreement there is across the board when it comes to unchecked crony capitalism, you'd think someone would try and run with the idea, but no one in Washington has any interest in actually stopping the influence of money on our political system."
12-3-1-1-1,"The constitution is not a suicide pact and dark money is quite literally an extensional threat (already mostly realized) to a representative government.Even if people love the idea of American Billionaires running the country, allowing such blatant bribery opens up serious foreign influence. Mostly super wealthy dictators with infinite money to spend to weaken their greatest enemy.So either the American system can fix this flaw, or it dies.Now it could be fixed through a simple law, if we had a sane SC. But we don't.Amendment is possible, but who is to say the SC just interprets as they wish? At this point we cannot depend on the SC to do the right thing. We also need judicial reform and term limits for SC. Or some other type of improvement.I'm open to ideas, but I think simply trusting the process if we try hard enough is not necessarily going to cut it. The situation is extremely dire. I hope fixing it is still on the table."
12-3-1-2,Pretty sure Arizona did something very similar as well. Same results
12-4,Does Super PAC even exist anywhere else in the world?

12-4-1-1,"Canada is actually pretty much right there too. Corporate lobbying is huge here, and there's no way all the money is Canadian."
12-4-1-1-1,"But why is lobbying so effective in Canada, when corporate contributions are limited?  Probably because the corporations also finance third-party advertisers."
12-4-1-1-2,Like practically *anything* related to telecoms and the CRTC. Bleh.
12-4-1-2,"Piggybacking off your last sentence --I'm not clever enough to either deny or reinforce this belief, but in Denmark we had a huge spectacle about banning circumcision, basicly to further estrange our muslim immigrant population, something our populist government wants more of in order to secure voters from the countrysideBut a few days before the vote in parliament was planned to be cast, people in our government got calls from both the US and Israel and essentially the circumcision ban was completely off-topic and irrelevant lol - it didn't get enough votes, alltouhh it was a sure fire hit a few days beforeSuper PACs is one thing but influence runs through other channels than strictly monetary ones"

They should avoid that situation as much as possible, but it remains to be seen if they will."

13-1-2-1-1-1-4-4,Not infinite money. The deficit will just get another zero for the sake of winning.
13-1-2-1-1-1-5,China only competes with the US economically because Western countries send their manufacturing to China. China really isn't innovative.
13-1-2-1-2,This might be a whoosh moment for me but..How so?
13-1-2-1-2-1,"Taiwan (TMSC) produces a huge volume of semi-conductors critical to US Technologly and manufacturing. It's hard to understand how vital this production is and how exspensive and time consuming it is to establish again. If that production was able to be moved to the US, a lot of the need strategically defend Taiwan from China would melt away."
13-1-2-1-2-1-2,"There would still be need to defend Taiwan from a geopolitical standpoint. If China can invade Taiwan in the name of “it was muh land,” then what’s to stop ~~China~~ North Korea from invading South Korea because of the same reason?There’s also a job creation reason, albeit weaker. If TSMC creates US jobs, contributes to US economy, and pays US tax dollars, the company would also have significant political sway in the state(s) it operates in."
13-1-2-1-2-2,"In short: TSMC, located in Taiwan, is the most advanced semiconductor fabrication facility in the world. If China waits for the US to build out a competitive facility, we will have less of an interest in protecting Taiwan. Until then, we are heavily dependent on TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing.There are other nuances to this, but that is the high level."
13-1-2-1-2-2-1,"Even if Taiwan's semiconductors were no longer an issue, the defense of Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Guam all become much more difficult with the CCP sitting in Taiwan.  I think the US defends Taiwan semiconductors or no."
13-1-2-1-2-3,"I think because Taiwan has said they will blow up their semiconductor factories before bending the knee for China. America’s economy (and healthcare, transpo, so many industries) rely heavily on Taiwan’s semiconductor production. So if China invades before we have our shit shored up over here, it will be bad news for just about everyone.I am happy to be wrong about all or any of this, this is my rudimentary understanding."
13-1-2-1-2-3-1,Everyone keeps saying US depends heavily on TSMC (which is true) but probably worth pointing out the whole world is dependent. TSMC and Samsung between them supply a huge chunk of the worlds chips.
13-1-2-1-2-5,"Because the United States and the Western World needs unfettered access to the a steady stream of microprocessors that in turn are the gear works to our globalized internet based economy and way of life.  Tiawain makes nearly all the computer processors in the world because it takes really advanced manufacturing techniques and skilled labor. Without a supply of new microprocessors to replace the old ones and make new products, the calendar on the economy would slowly then quickly roll back. That is changing, but until then Tiawain is strategic."

13-1-2-4,A communications disruption could mean only one thing: invasion.
13-1-2-5,What about the Russian attack on the Ukrainians?!
13-1-3,People who think this is over semiconductors don't understand the issue... This has been an issue and position of the US government from well before semiconductors were even a thing.It's about protecting the first island chain.
13-1-3-1,I think it can be both. The US has committed to protecting Taiwan for longer than they’ve been an important semiconductor hub. Now that Taiwan is though it is even more important for the US to keep them a secure trading partner. The war in Ukraine has shown how quickly they can be exhausted.
13-1-5,What a colossal failure of humanity to have the source of modern technology centered in one geopolitically messy place.
13-1-5-1,I think it's a tremendous success for humanity that a small island country living in the shadow of a fascist superpower was able to become a thriving democracy capable of inventing the world's most advanced computer chips.
13-1-5-1-1,"It's also a prime example of ""work smarter, not harder"".  Rather than going full-on North Korea and enrolling every able-body person they could get into military training, building bunkers everywhere they can, etc., they've sunk themselves into high-tech capabilities.  Making them indispensable to the world at large not only helps guarantee their security, it has made their people's quality of life pretty good.Machiavelli would have been smiling at their skillful play."
13-1-5-1-1-1,"Not to disagree or take away from Taiwan's accomplishments, but it's a blessing how it turned out the way it did since they did dip down the other route a bit initially."
13-1-5-1-1-1-1,"Initially? Their first election was in '96, and the country was under martial law until the late 80s. It's miraculous they've turned out as not-terrible as they are now."
13-1-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, “initially” as in from its inception, it doesn’t necessarily mean an on/off thing or however length of time."
13-1-5-1-2,"It's great that they're able to do that, I agree. The problem is how much of it is concentrated there."
13-1-5-1-3,"Asking a noobish question but what's so special about a silicon chip that it can't be manufactured anywhere else? It's just silicon (sand) at the end, is it patents that protect the whole process?Also, wasn't it Sweden/Norway who, in fact, pioneered the whole transistor and circuit design thing first, is it just cheap to buy it from Taiwan instead of manufacturing in their home countries?"
13-1-5-1-3-1,"The speed and efficiency of the most advanced chips requires circuits and elements so small they can only be etched through extremely complicated processes that involve ultraviolet lasers. No other fabricator (not even Intel) can do what Taiwan Semiconductor does at the moment.It's not patents so much as trade secrets and institutional knowledge. And it takes years and billions of dollars to build a fabrication plant for a new chip-making technique, so you can't just nab a few engineers and then start cranking out five-nanometer CPUs. It's one of the most capital-intensive industries in existence.Slower chips? Sure, anyone can make those. But China can't make anything that competes with, say, the chip in a recent iPhone or Nvidia graphics card."
13-1-5-1-3-1-1,"And the main reason it’s such a national security issue too is because of AI/ML. Those applications require the most advanced and powerful chips on the market to be useful. Nvidia graphics cards, Google Tensor processors, etc are what all AI and ML research use for training and industries also use them in production. The US does not want China to have an advantage in this area."
13-1-5-2,I mean Intel is trying to change that.  There's plans to build a major US semiconductor manufacturer near Columbus Ohio.  It is kind of weird that it took this long to happen  though.
13-1-5-2-1,"I think its less Intel and more the us govs priorities changed.  Not saying its bad, but they got paid huge amounts to build that here to where theyd be dumb not to.When logistics broke from covid and chip shortages hit everything from hospital equipment to huge fields of cars tyat couldnt be complete because of missing chips it was a bit of a wake up call to how dependant we are and what a national security risk it is."
13-1-5-3,next up : why is our wheat from Ukraine and our oil from the Middle East ?
13-1-5-3-1,Because geography. A different reason.
13-1-5-4,Time is a thing too.
13-1-5-5,"China has clarified that they have no intention of violently invading and see citizens of Taiwan as family. While I agree with the US position to defend Taiwan should that promise be broken, the media should tone down the perceived level of danger."
13-1-5-5-2,Just like Russia would never invade Ukraine...
13-1-5-5-2-2,"I mean Russia had already done it previous with Crimea, but everyone casually forgot about that."
13-1-5-5-3,And as we all know China is well known saying factual things that don’t ever go against their motives.Maybe ask Taiwan how they feel about China
13-1-5-5-3-1,That’s the point. US stance is to let Taiwan continue self-governance via guaranteeing defensive aid if necessary. Fear mongering doesn’t help the process. Let China try to convince them peacefully to give up their independence (imo unlikely).
13-1-5-5-3-1-1,Lmao just stop
13-1-5-5-4,">While I agree with the US position to defend Taiwan should that promise be broken, the media should tone down the perceived level of danger.If that ""promise"" is broken then it's already too late. Countries would be at war. I don't understand this logic - do you think China will be idle if they're not met with opposition?"
13-2,Guess we know now which maps are going to be on the new CoD's first expansion pack
13-2-1,Funny enough BF4 had a lot of maps in China just not centered around a naval invation of Taiwan.
13-2-1-1,"As BF4 veteran, I had no idea Naval Strike DLC was based on that. The more I know"
13-2-1-1-1,There's a bit of an odd story-link between Naval Strike and Final Stand.Naval Strike is the U.S. clashing with China in the South China Sea. Dragons Teeth is the invasion of mainland China. And Final Stand is a U.S. covert ops into Siberia to stop Russia's military research into weapons and aircraft seen in Battlefield 2142 using Intel gathered from the invasion of China.Can you tell that this game is banned in China?
13-2-1-1-1-2,"Man I just want a new BF2142, But I know they'd fuck it all up."
13-2-1-1-1-2-1,"I was so hoping we'd see some of 2142 in 2042. But noooo, they had to throw the franchise into the AAA blender as usual."
13-2-2,"Warzone already did it lol. Their first map, Verdansk, was basically Donetsk btw"
13-2-2-1,Donetsk is the new Verdun
13-2-2-1-1,"And Kharkov is, well, still Kharkov.How many Battles of Kharkov are we up to now?"
13-2-2-1-1-1,"Ukraine has been a bloody battleground for centuries, like much of Eastern Europe. Off the top of my head there was significant fighting in what is now Ukraine in the Napoleonic era, the Crimean War, WW1, and WW2. There are probably a dozen Battles of Kyiv big enough to be named as such, and a dozen sieges besides.EDIT: Napoleon went through Belarus instead, but the two centuries before him were even bloodier than I remembered."
13-2-2-1-1-1-1,"If you look at Ukraine's geography you'll see it's mostly flat grasslands.  This makes it easy to invade, hard to defend.Couple that with rich, fertile soil and and a half dozen cultures that hate each other and quite frankly it becomes a wonder the country isn't under attack every other month."
13-2-2-1-1-1-1-2,"Historically, yeah. Modern drones and wire guided missiles make that sort of landscape a bloodbath though"
13-2-2-1-1-1-1-3,This is why Kramer labelled it a road apple. You can just drive your tanks right in.
13-2-2-1-1-1-2,[Just about.] Good reckoning.
13-2-2-1-1-1-2-1,> the third of three battles fought in Kiev in 19191919 was rough.
13-2-2-1-1-1-2-2,"Damn, Mongols fucked them good."
13-2-2-1-1-1-3,Not to mention the constant back and forth fighting between cossack settlers and Crimean and Nogai slave raiders. The area was in a state of constant low level war for centuries with periods of high intensity state conflict occasionally.
13-2-2-1-1-1-4,"That explains a lot about why Ukraine has handled this so well.  To a lot of us we were terrified of war breaking out. Ukrainians were like ""Well, it's been 20 minutes, guess we're back to this."""
13-2-2-1-1-1-4-1,"Honestly no. War is horrific. Especially real war like what Ukraine is experiencing. But yes in that they are doing well, all horrors considering…"
13-2-2-1-1-1-4-2,"Horror is still horrible, even if it’s regular"
13-2-2-1-1-1-4-3,Nah a bit more complex than that. Ukrainians have not always been heavy hitters.
13-2-2-1-1-1-5,That’s because Ukraine is an area where a lot of food is grown and has good ports. It would make sense that in the past countries would want to have an area with ports and fertile land.
13-2-2-1-1-2,Four in WW2 and two more currently. (the main assault and now the counter-offensive)History teaches us a lot of things - and one of them is that Kharkov / Kharkiv is a graveyard for armies
13-2-2-1-1-2-1,">Kharkov / Kharkiv is a graveyard for armiesAnd Karkov is a cheap/shitty vodka that's supposed to sound Russian but is actually made by Congressman Dean Phillips in Princeton, MN for alcoholics.Just a random fact on a Sunday evening."
13-2-2-1-1-2-1-2,"Lmao didn’t know our local product was that famous, I grew up in Elk River and knew a number of people that worked there."
13-2-2-1-1-2-2,It's like flat plains and mountainous regions are hard to defend and attack or something like that
13-2-2-1-1-4,Is there any talk of a reversal in crimea?
13-2-2-1-1-4-2,heard a sound bite a few days ago with Zelenskyy  specifically mentioning Crimea would be back in Ukrainian control along with the rest of the country
13-2-2-1-1-5,I think you mean Kharkiv
13-2-2-1-2,">Donetsk is the new VerdunBoth sides of this battle had more casualties alone than Russia and ukraine together.Maybe in a year you can say this, if the war still is going until then."
13-2-2-1-2-1,"Some hyperbolic comparisons of battles in Ukraine now to WWI and WWII battles fail to comprehend how absolutely devestating those wars were. The siege of Mariupol was awful, don't get me wrong, but it was no Stalingrad."
13-2-2-1-2-2,"Both sides of this battle had more casualties than Russia and Ukraine had combined in the entire war (not just Donetsk) - much more. There is no comparission between the world wars and this war.The USSR alone lost an entire division per day on average in WW2. From 1941 to 1945. Every single day. Just military deaths, just one out of many nations. The scales are sooo much bigger when it comes to the world wars."
13-2-2-1-3,To go from Donbass region of Ukraine to Volgograd is 6 hours. Volgograd is the new name of the city of Stalingrad. So you could say they have a history there.
13-2-2-1-3-1,I don't know why but every time I see Donbass I think dumb ass.
13-2-2-1-3-1-1,You know exactly why lol
13-2-2-1-4,"I dunno, Verdun was a special hell even by WWI standards"
13-2-2-2,"Yehorivka is a Ukrainian map in Squad. I played a couple matches there as the invasion happened and the mood (very chatty game) was pretty somber. Then Ukraine kicked the ever-loving shit out of Russia, so it’s now a meme that when playing as the Russian faction and losing you’re just roleplaying."
13-2-2-2-1,"Yeah, and for reference to non-Squad players, Yehorivka is very strongly based on a real section of Ukrainian countryside. Squad has some very realistic maps, especially Skorpo which was constructed with (iirc) a meter-scale heightmap of Norwegian coast. Also, a slightly scaled down Fallujah and surrounds, and a map named Talil with a real airbase."
13-2-2-2-2,"I feel like this is a variation on the time Yeltsin visited a supermarket in the US, saw aisles packed with thousands of items, and knew the USSR's communist system had lost."
13-2-2-3,Imagine being a soldier and showing up to Donetsk to fight and you look around and it’s like “oh shit I’ve literally been here in Warzone.” That must be trippy as hell
13-2-2-4,Azovstal is going to be in there 100%.
13-2-2-5,"I'm outta the loop, what's being talked about?Are they making maps on video games based off real life war?Am I reading that right?"
13-2-3,"Second expansion pack, their first will be in Ukraine"
13-2-4,Battlefield 4 already had China VS USA VS Russia. The world is merely catching up.
13-3,"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
13-3-2,Perfect reference Sil
13-4,We kinda have to since Taiwan supplies so of the tech the world economy depends on. We would definitely feel a change in the quality of life if China took over Taiwan as the best chip tech would no longer be available to us.
13-4-1,That's why American Microcomputer companies have been looking into and developing domestic production. Taiwan's fabrication facilities are incredible though. It will take many years to get similar operations domestically.
13-4-1-2,"Not even that. TSMC and Samsung are already beginning to build extra fabs in Arizona and Texas, respectively."
13-4-1-2-1,"Eh, have you seen the size of the proposed fabs in Arizona? It’s like a fraction of what the fabs are in Taiwan. In no capacity will they be able to produce cutting edge silicon."
13-4-1-2-1-1,"It’s fairly obvious what Taiwan’s intentions are there. Build a token industry to build relations, and give the US infrastructure to slowly build up a superconductor industry in the event of a Taiwan war, without doing so at a scale that makes them any less dependent on Taiwan."
13-4-1-2-1-1-1,Hell ya. And it's working. Thats why we're here lol.
13-4-1-2-2,Intel is in Ohio as well for a $20B fab.
13-4-1-2-3,Those facilities will not be capable of creating the \*best\* chips. The smallest of chips can still only be created in Taiwan.
13-4-2,Meh. Our chip situation would be just fine. We still have Cool Ranch Doritos.
13-4-2-2,The real man that we all need
13-4-4,We would feel a greater “change in the quality of life” from fighting a nuclear world war with the second-largest economy on Earth. But there are more reasons to defend Taiwan than the chips.
13-4-5,"Even in event of a Chinese annexation of Taiwan, why do you think they'll stop selling it to US?Business will continue, but the money will go in someone else pocket."
13-5,Oh shit!  Finally laying it out for China.  Let’s see their witty repartee.Update: Seems pretty mature so far tbh:

13-5-1-3-3,Seriously how much is this fucking up our oceans?
13-5-1-3-4,Orrr they decide to help Russia in Ukraine. There was no need to state this explicitly. Just asking for problems. Obviously China already knows this.
13-5-1-3-4-1,"China has zero interest in joining Russia’s little adventure. They get very little out of Russia winning, aside from being able to take a couple jabs at the West. They already can do that."
13-5-1-3-4-1-2,Big picture if the Russian government is essentially overthrown and a pro-western government is instituted they lose a major ally and potential border threat. China wants buffers such as Russia and North Korea in the same way Russia wants buffers like Ukraine and Belarus. That's reason the war exists in the first place. They potentially lose a lot by Russia losing.
13-5-1-3-4-1-2-1,Have you submitted this fan fiction to a website?
13-5-1-3-4-2,"I've seen some video of Ukrainian forces capturing Russian equipment and there was Chinese mortar rounds, so maybe they already are."
13-5-1-3-4-2-2,I read that that was actually Ukrainians recapturing their own mortar shells - Ukraine had got them from China decades ago. Russians captured them but couldn't use them since they were a different diameter or something like that
13-5-1-3-4-2-3,"> they decide to help Russia in UkraineI loved the announcements during Russia's latest retreat. [""Russia largest supplier of arms to Ukraine""]"
13-5-1-3-4-3,China is extremely incompetent too. Let’s not pretend they aren’t. I traveled to help set up clinics in hospitals for a summer and all of the doctors had bachelors degrees. They had no concept of PCR and what was required for sterilization. It was a complete fucking joke. That country is basically a cheap impression of a cheap impression. What Ukraine was able to do to Russia we would be able to do to China in about 1/10 of the time. The fact that they have so many people is actually a strategic nightmare. We are able to accomplish magnitudes more with magnitudes less.
13-5-1-3-4-3-1,"the last thing china wants is open conflict and to be found as inept as the Russian military has proven to be. Like it or not the american military's capabilities have been on display for over half a century. all china can do is bluster, because even the analysts had their military below Russia's in capability"
13-5-1-3-4-3-2,We had a very similar experience installing digital PCR platforms in China. There’s a problem with decision making.
13-5-1-3-4-3-4,Damn guess the Chinese became the world's N.2 world power in 20 years by being incompetent. Guess they dominate global trade and military modernization by being a bunch of goobers.
13-5-1-3-4-3-4-1,"They dominate Global trade? What are you talking about, their cheap labor? Ahhh such an asset, 1 billion people used as cheap labor is not a liability at all…lol. They dominate military modernization? WTF are you even talking about?  They are a paper tiger run by a clown. Xi is the least competent leader I’ve seen rise to power in a long time. Just look how he fumbled Hong Kong. He took something that could’ve been such a benefit to China and basically ruined it for China. He’s a fucking moron. Jerk them off all you want but they honestly are a very incompetent organization that does not have shit on the United States. They are a number two world power like a high school football team is number two playing against an NFL team in the Super Bowl."
13-5-1-3-4-3-5,"Your anecdote about working at a hospital means nothing.They have a lot of money. Their military tech has been exponentially improving (because of said money). Govt has complete control so they have the willingness and means for a protracted commitment.If they want to turn the Ukraine war into a 10 or 20 year conflict they could. Probably longer than the west would be willing to pay, given our democracy ADHD.The truth is without Western aid Ukraine would not be where it is today. With Chinese support the tides could change. The Korean war is a good precedent to look at. I don't think it's wise to poke the bear."
13-5-1-3-4-3-5-1,"That bear has documented widespread institutional incompetencies, corruption, and pillaging. I think we’d be just fine.Also, lies are only powerful when people don’t know you were lying. The world at large has learned so much in the last four years about narcissism and liars. Putin, Trump, Xi. They’re all liars. Narcissistic liars. No one is scared of them because it’s all saber rattling and incompetence. Once you see the trick the gimmick is up. All three of those fucking losers have to go."
13-5-1-3-4-3-5-2,"Even though I can agree that China is more competent than “made in China” memes, Korean War doesn’t prove your point.When China joined, their sheer number shocked the US-led force, push them back. However, the US side quickly realized Chinese army is very bad, and pushed back quickly and successfully. However, after the US side pushed past the border a considerable amount, they stopped and agreed to stalemate at the pre war border.Based on that, I would believe it was due to the threat of Soviet joining the war that US back down, not the Chinese army."
13-5-1-3-4-4,Let's fight.
13-5-1-3-4-4-1,Why?
13-5-1-3-4-5,Really seems like their now cooperating because they both realize they're nowhere near peer with the west. The realization is they're both decades behind so sharing is mutually beneficial.
13-5-1-3-4-5-1,"I don't think this is necessarily a technology gap. A lot of Ukraine's weaponry early in the fight was pretty low tech. Even now a lot of the tech they're using that has been massively effective has been low tech (drone bombs). Add on top of that the wealth of the west (ammunition and hi tech weapon systems) and intelligence, they have of course done very well so far.Well guess what? China has all of that same stuff that we have. They can build drones. They can provide ammunition and intelligence. They can provide hi tech weaponry and have the resources to do so. The main lever we have against them is our strong economic ties but that has been eroding since COVID and if you give their politicians enough reasons, they can be as boisterous and hawkish as us."
13-5-1-3-4-5-1-2,"China has an 80,000 ton displacement conventionally powered carrier that would have been considered outdated by American standards by the 70's and entirely obsolete by the 2010s. They have a little over 50 of their next generation fighters, compared with our 450+ F-35s and 170 or so F-22s. They talk a lot about hypersonics but the SM-6 has been in service for a decade and is designed to shoot those down. Their directed energy (laser) technology doesn't seem impressive. Their drones exist but have nothing on the latest American drones.Even in internal Chinese government propaganda, they claim that their goal is to have a world standard military by 2050. Until then they aren't even pretending to be on par with the US"
13-5-1-3-4-5-1-3,">I don't think this is necessarily a technology gapThere's a massive tech gap in things like air assets, targeting systems, radar/missile defense systems, and intelligence.>Add on top of that the wealth of the west (ammunition and hi tech weapon systems) and intelligence, they have of course done very well so far.Those are exactly what has decided the war. It was mostly a stalemate until western intelligence and some more advanced systems arrived.This shows how western technology would easily overrun Russia or China. Hell Russia couldn't even hold the air against Ukraine's meager air assets the US would have control of the air almost immediately."

13-5-4-2,"I'm really curious if these explicit statements from Biden and his staff walking it back are on purpose.

14-1-1-1,Honestly if it weren't for that video I'd know almost nothing about the bill.  Each side wants to hammer the talking points and that's about it and there's so much more to it than that.

Something that really struck me here is that this is *the end* for demand-side climate policies, because people *hate* demand-side climate policies. We've just had a test run of the effects of a carbon tax, and it turns out it turns drivers into raging fascists. So that's a non-starter; the only *politically* possible thing to do is to make it cheaper and easier to not use fossil fuels.Which means much of the remaining action is going to be at the state and local level: rebates for ebikes, protected bike lanes, better transit, parking reform, urbanization, and so on."

14-1-1-1-4,Something that's driven me insane for years. We have three 24 hour a day news networks dedicated almost exclusively to US politics. Not one of them reports what legislation has passed or what's in them beyond the biggest bills and only the flashy parts of those. I can't even find a website that does much of a job breaking them down. So now we're a nation full of political experts who don't have the slightest idea what the government is actually doing.

14-1-2,Just glad that someone is talking about this bill. The media is currently all in on Trump and his nuclear documents which is unfortunate since this is a BFD.

14-3-2,"Only 50 of the Fortune 500 paid less than 15% in taxes last year. So this will have an impact, but not in some crazy dramatic way. It’s just a minimum tax so the 450 companies that were already above that won’t be impacted at all.In my opinion the threshold should be at least 10% higher and around 25%. The corporate tax rate was almost 53% in 1968, so this is still historically low."
14-3-2-1,"While this is valid, you have to ask ""what proportions of the top earners were in that 50?"". You have to remember, the fortune 500 is already the selection of the most valuable, highest earning companies.Amazon and Netflix, some of the most highly valued companies on the planet, are in that group. It's not just ""how many avoided taxes?"" but also ""how much did each avoid?"".If 50 companies pay little to nothing in tax, but they make up half of the earnings of the fortune 500, that's a lot more impactful. Remember, it's a pareto distribution."
14-3-2-1-1,"Definitely a valid thing to point out. The anticipated earnings over 10 years though are $300 billion. When you consider the IRS collects $4.1 Trillion per year (and refunds $1.1 Trillion,) $300 billion is a pretty obvious drop in the bucket. Step in the right direction, but we ain’t “taxing the rich” just get."

Thats the dream, I want to see people like that do well and not be demonized.It is the extremely wealthy people and the corporations not paying their fair share, not the low level millionaires that are the problem."
14-3-3-1-2,"And passing the cost onto consumers in the form of higher prices.Same thing with the EV credits. You thought the consumer was going to save $7,500 on the purchase? Wrong, Ford just raised their price by $8,500."
14-3-3-1-2-1,> And passing the cost onto consumersOther than moving on from capitalism I don't think there's anything we can do about passing the cost. What we need is competition. There's a reason the capitalists fight competition.
14-3-3-1-2-1-1,Move on from capitalism to what? Socialism? Communism? Where the government becomes the monopoly?Capitalism is based on competition
14-3-3-1-2-1-1-1,"Used to be, but now some companies have gotten so large there’s no competition and on top of that can buy the govt with their lobbying power. And lack of campaign contribution regulations."

I'm sorry this is capitalism 101. The less competition the higher the prices. You want lower prices? Increase competition. It's not really that hard, but it seems many capitalists lack the willpower."
14-3-3-1-2-1-1-3,"This is laughable.Modern “capitalism” is little more than a mechanism inevitably creating a stratified society, with profligate socialism for the wealthy and for corporations (the means by which the wealthy exploit the people), and “rugged individualism” (in actuality it’s wage slavery and desperation) for the rest.Your view is analogous to that of the battered spouse defending their oppressor."
14-3-3-1-2-1-1-4,"Let's see how that competition works nowadays:You make a product, you want to sell it, only place you can sell it is Amazon, because not putting your product on Amazon means a reduced target audience of over 95%.Amazon sees your product sells well, they copy it and subsidize the cost, highly undercutting you.Everyone buys the Amazon copy.Thanks Capitalism."

So while in your current role you’re not making more, you might be able to fill another company’s need, and you’ll get paid more there.But, these changes will have a blow back affect, but as Americans we can blow back harder."
14-3-3-1-2-4,"They can only do this because demand for EVs is far outstripping supply. When supply starts to balance, there will be price wars. But for now, the demand is driving manufacturers to invest in production and innovation."
14-3-3-1-3,Except the new tax isn’t actually set up to do that
14-3-3-1-3-1,Individuals can't do buybacks and Corporate taxes are Corporate taxes
14-3-3-1-3-2,"Even if the tax cuts do bias upward, instituting a minimum tax to be paid at 15% may counteract any cuts.That plus funding of IRS enforcement for known tax evaders will rake it in.

None of those incredibly stupid investments and allowances for more fossil fuel infrastructure. More 'Just Transition' policies that decarbonize our economy while investing in working and lower class communitiesNot just 'tax rebates for electric cars' but an actual goddamn high speed rail for the country.

14-4-1-1-1-1-2-3,"We just got our youngest into public Pre-K.  I was under the impression it was just for the underprivileged or special needs kids, but it turns out any unfilled seats just get allocated on a first come, first serve basis.  It’s saving us $800+ a month and covering more hours than the private pre-k plus daycare combo we’d be doing instead would cost.I would have loved to have any sort of assisted early childhood education in the past."

14-4-1-2-2,Republicans claim to be in favor of closing this loophole. I have no idea why it hasn't been made into a separate bill so they can prove it.

14-5-1-1-1-1-1-2,I mean they were saying fuck. But the reporter couldn't say fuck on the air. So they improvised.

14-5-2,"Next month, student loan debt…"
14-5-2-1,Month after that…Cannabis
14-5-2-1-1,This and the student loan could easily help Democrats win the midterms.
14-5-2-1-2,"Month after that, expungement of all cannabis-related crimes?"
15,Biden urges Congress to codify Roe v. Wade into law
15-1,Manchin & Sinema’s states both have trigger laws that will ban abortion as soon as SCOTUS releases this opinion (if this is indicative of the final draft).I wonder how they’ll feel about “preserving” the filibuster if it means securing abortion access nationwide.
15-1-1,"Sinema will probably say ""not yet, wait until something big happens""."
15-1-1-1,In Ireland it took a national story about a hospital being forced to let a pregnant woman die.
15-1-1-1-1,Yep.More people need to know what happened to Savita Halappanavar and realize that’s the future we’re heading towards.A future where women die because their dead fetus starts to rot in their womb while the doctors wait to remove it because they’re too scared of being charged with illegal abortion.
15-1-1-1-1-1,"[Anencephaly images - nsfw][CDC Information on Anencephaly]>Researchers estimate that about 1 in every 4,600 babies is born with anencephaly in the United States.>There is no known cure or standard treatment for anencephaly. Almost all babies born with anencephaly will die shortly after birth.Why would you force anyone to go through with a pregnancy like this.  Who is this supposed to benefit?"
15-1-1-1-1-1-1,I have friends that had to abort a very wanted fetus due to this and other very serious issues. I guess they are fortunate that it was before all this BS takes place.
15-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,Same. After 4 years of infertility and IVF with multiple losses (including an ectopic that ruptured requiring emergency surgery and the loss of a tube) I chose to TFMR at 22 weeks because both our lives were in danger. I chose to not make him suffer 5-7 days of misery in the NICU if he even survived birth
15-1-1-1-1-1-1-2,There are a lot of us who have ended a wanted pregnancy for serious foetal issues.  I’m in a support group with thousands of other women in the same situation.
15-1-1-1-1-1-1-3,The insane number of disturbing things that can lead to a perfectly valid and reasonable choice to have an abortion should make people humbly step the fuck out of their megalomaniac control fantasies.
15-1-1-1-1-1-1-4,Who says that you cannot abort a baby in order to save the mothers life?
15-1-1-1-1-1-2,>Who is this supposed to benefit?The egos of self-righteous religious extremists.
15-1-1-1-1-1-4,"My friend's son had Encephalocele - where the bones don't fully grow, but the skin closes over it, so the brain squeezes out through the hole and makes a bulbus lump of exposed brain under a light layer of skin. Trust me, NO ONE benefits. Not even the poor doctors and nurses who have to care for the child in their short hours of pure pain and agony."
15-1-1-1-1-2,"Lol. This is the same place where a man marched into an elementary school and killed 25 people, 20 of whom were between 6 and 7 years old and we did fuck all about firearms reform."
15-1-1-1-1-2-1,Some of the country still thinks it was fake
15-1-1-1-1-2-1-2,happened right at the end of 2012. In a way it was one of our first great misinformation campaigns.

15-1-1-1-1-3-1-2,This is why we need the daughter to be Claudia Conway-level defiantly outspoken against that parent and publicly expose the parent's attempts to fly them to a legal state for an abortion.
15-1-1-1-1-4,Might be time to start showing these pictures to the fucks who protest at clinics.
15-1-1-1-1-4-1,The pro-life crowd actually brought them out when election day rolled around. The only posters I saw trying to save the 8th had pictures of dead babies on them.
15-1-1-1-1-5,In the U.S. anyone who is anti abortion wouldn’t give two shits.
15-1-1-1-2,"Yeah, but we’ve had years of stories about children being shot and people dying, especially since 2020 rolled around.A shocking number of people just don’t…seem to care…"
15-1-1-1-2-1,">A few dead children a year is a small price to pay for my right to guns.-Bill O'reilly, and he didn't suffer a drop in ratings after saying that. [When you believe stratified social hierarchy is necessary, you'll allow a lot of cruelty in order to support it.]"
15-1-1-1-2-1-1,"I've been massively downvoted in the past for saying this, but no one can convince me otherwise: Americans prefer school shootings to gun control.  Soon we'll have to add ""Americans prefer dead women to abortions"" or maybe ""Americans prefer losing wives, sisters, mothers, and daughters over abortions."""
15-1-1-1-5,"FYI this is America, we could have a 11 year old rape victim trying to seek an abortion but Republicans would rather beat her then force her to marry her rapists.We have women, wives of congressmen/senate members who nearly died from being denied an abortion and guess what? REPUBLICANS DO NOT CARE. Fuck you and your family, their crazy thoughts are what's important. Not you, not your sister, not your wife, ect. But I can tell you they would be the first to line up to have their mistresses get abortions. It's an imaginary moral code to force you into a life you do not want so they can pat themselves on a job well done."

15-1-4,"Reminder that Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn have endorsed Henry Cuellar: **the last remaining anti-choice Democrat in the House**, because his challenger is a Bernie-allied Progressive. A female, pro-choice candidate. They're going to campaign for anti-choice Cuellar this week.Moderate and Conservative Democrats beating Progressive Democrats is more important than women's human rights to Democratic leadership, apparently. Their blatant sign that women's rights are sacrifices on the altar of their Jihad to stop Progressives doesn't inspire confidence that the party will do all that is necessary to enshrine women's rights."
15-1-5,Lol if they get rid of the filibuster abortion will be nationally banned by 2023.

15-2-2-3-1,AidAccess is $100-150 in most jurisdictions.
15-2-2-4,"They only work up to 10 weeks though. Normally it's 24 weeks, with chance for later abortion after doctor approval."

15-4,"*And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.""*"
15-4-1,"I’ve seen so much rampant cynical apathy posturing since this news broke. More than normal, which is saying a lot.It’s like a circular firing squad. “2016 turnout is to blame. Hillary is to blame. The DNC is to blame. Biden is to blame. Congressional Dems are to blame.”REPUBlICANS are to blame. 1,000x more than anyone else.Instead of turning all our frustrations inward, this should be the ultimate motivation to vote these extremely dangerous people out of office.We don’t have time for this contrarian bickering. It’s like a car headed for a cliff, and all the passengers are squabbling about how they got there - while McConnell is whistling to himself and flooring the pedal."
15-4-1-1,"I'm utilizing this time which is seen as a Dooming session to spread info on what could be done. The polls are currently saying D+1, a 11 point swing from R+10 back in November for the House surveys, which means toss-up (citing the WaPo/ABC poll which is certified as the A+ poll).That means every vote, even an extra thousand in battleground states goes a long way down the line.I do find that not enough people turn up for municipal and state Legislative elections, but they yield higher impact compared to federal, because they are your local people making the decisions. I emphasize on subs like r/voteDEM because I have been in this community back since it used to be r/bluemidterm2018. I have seen gains, and strategies develop that's paying off in past elections."
15-4-1-1-1,"Thank you. Down ballot races are so incredibly important. Not only do they have direct power over elections, they also rise up the ladder into higher political positions.State legislatures, Secretaries of State, and governors are every bit as important as Congressional races."
15-4-1-1-1-1,"When I showed up to my local town election, I'm surrounded by old people.And I'm in a blue state (CT) but my town is GOP. 3 Dem, 6 GOP on the town council. Some of the Dem town reps, including my 5th grade teacher busted their ass for years to get elected to which they finally did in the past few years.Also CT, if we got Stefanowski back in 2018, our COVID response would be shit and we would still be in heavy deficit. Lamont helped the state survive and we are in budget surplus. There's going to be increased tax reductions along with debt payments ongoing. Years ago, it was feared that we would need a highway toll, not anymore."
15-4-1-1-1-1-2,"I was at a conference last week of local elected officials (township boards, etc) and 90% of the people were over 60. We need to get the next generation into local politics so they can move up the ladder."
15-4-1-1-1-2,">State legislatures, Secretaries of State, and governors are every bit as important as Congressional races.sometimes arguably more - Secretaries of State in a swing state, for instance, can change the outcome of Presidential elections by curtailing or expanding the right to vote within their official powers.and Whitmer is suing to keep abortion legal in Michigan at this moment. a Republican would not be doing that.while the federal government voted to give aid in the last few years, it was your state and municipal governments that chose how to allocate a lot of it.for on-the-ground, locally felt impacts, focusing on your local and state races are enormously important, and affect both you and the national discourse.(i know i'm preaching to the choir - i'm just reiterating **how** important it is to focus on state and local races as much as federal offices)"
15-4-1-1-2,Thanks for reminding me to go vote during my lunch break!
15-4-1-1-3,"Isn't D+1 likely a sizeable majority for Republicans in the House due to massive gerrymandering? I just remembered this post from 2018:[So unless it is at least D+5.5, it is more likely that the Republicans will control the House."
15-4-1-2,"Some of it is deliberate. Convince people to give up, cynicism is cool and smart, and the religious reich has an easy win. Claim votes don’t count, protests don’t work, while your side votes and protests, and you get a massive advantage."
15-4-1-2-2,"There's one right above you doing this.It worked in 2000, it worked in 2016, there's no reason for them to change the playbook because it keeps working.Convincing your opponent that there's no reason to vote is just as good as earning a vote for your side. It's a stupid system, but that's the math of it."
15-4-1-3,"its a hard road but please keep urging others to vote! though you may receive much apathy and criticism, just reminding others of their ability, right and responsibility to vote is likely some of the most power an individual has."
15-4-1-4,"Those people don't represent me, I can't vote them out of office. I imagine a lot of other people here are in the same position."
15-4-1-5,"Dems had 50 years to solidify abortion rights and they didn't. That's in the people in power, not the voters."

15-4-2-1-2-2,"""Pro-Life"" is rich coming from the same people who LUUUVVV guns and capital punishment"
15-4-2-1-3,Pro-Suffering
15-4-2-1-4,Fuck the term Pro-life. People get abortions if necessary so they can live a good life.
15-4-2-1-4-1,Agreed to be truly pro-life means you are against the death penalty and for supporting people in need.  Republicans are neither of these things.
15-4-2-1-5,Anti-women
15-4-2-1-5-1,"Anti- everyone really. Anti children who will suffer in poverty or living through unloved childhoods because they were unplanned and never wanted, anti woman who have to give up some/all of their future plans etc, anti men who now have to pay child support for a child neither parent wanted and both would have been comfortable and happy not having, the communities the financial support burden these unwanted children and subsequent adults will have.These rulings will always affect the impoverished the most. These children will experience a myriad of childhoods, but I can’t neglect the bad for the potential of good. Unloved, unwanted, underfunded, pick two and you may still end up with the third."
15-4-3,Too bad the voters are determined to punish the Democrats for not making everything sunshine and rainbows in 17 months.The real irony is that when these voters put the Republicans in power there’s no chance in hell the thing they want fixed will be fixed.
15-4-3-1,"I agree. There are too many with the mindset of “I didn’t get everything I wanted so I’m not going to vote”. The truth of it is, sometimes you have to go with what you’re given. If that means choosing the lesser of two evils then that’s what it means."
15-4-3-1-2,"Those Slsmall minded people want instant gratification, they want to walk out the poll booth and have all their student loans paid off, MC4A, $20 minimum wage and whatever else they want.I want anyone who reads this to stop and realize that progress is not instant it takes time and effort. It needs you to vote in local, Mayoral, and state elections not just the presidential and don't hit me with that ""Voter apathy"" crap, you can't have Apathy if you never vote."
15-4-3-1-2-2,"Progress takes time, but regression seems to be flying full tilt boogie."
15-4-3-1-2-3,"Completely agree. Incremental change works. We're seeing the result of 6 years worth of regression from 2016. Voters might not see it immediately, but they'll feel it in no time."
15-4-3-1-2-3-1,"Everything takes time us what I try to tell everyone. You would see much more consistent progress if America wasn't one of the most bipolar countries, where we have to spend 4 years unfucking up what Republicans did. It's always going to look like it's getting worse but it will start getting better with 2008 being the perfect example of this."
15-4-3-1-2-4,It's pretty funny that you think this system actually reflects the will of the people. You seriously think that all you have to do is vote and everything will be fine. The system is unequivocally broken and the fact that you can't see that after all these years is the definition of insanity
15-4-3-1-2-4-1,"I don't think that all you have to do is vote, I think one should be educated on how our system actually works, participate in all levels of voting, and look into who you actually cast your vote for. The system is not broken my dude you just don't know how it works. Progress takes consistency and time."
15-4-3-1-2-4-1-2,"You're right. The will of the people is certainly being reflected here, the majority of people love being ruled by six robes elders who can take away their rights on a whim"
15-4-3-1-2-5,"They don’t grasp that politics is strategic too. So many people are surprised that as we get closer to midterms the Biden admin is seeming to get closer to canceling some student debt. It’s not even a little bit surprising, voters have memories like goldfish, and if on day one Biden had federally decriminalized weed and completely canceled student debt, when midterms finally rolled around those acts would be completely forgotten by the same people that are complaining about them not happening yet. It’s shitty, but that’s just the reality of the human psyche."
15-4-3-1-3,"If Democrats were doing everything in their power to deliver their agenda and the promises Biden campaigned on you'd be 100% right. But that isn't the case. For example there are actions that Biden could take tomorrow regarding student loans and marijuana that he has chosen not to take. Voter aparthy is a natural consequence of this decision. Nobody is owed votes, you can't expect the base to energise itself. It's a politicians job to convince people to vote for them.Now maybe they did the math and figured they'd lose more votes then they qould gain by following through on their promises, thats fair enough but you can't then complain about losing that smaller number of votes."
15-4-3-1-3-1,"I’m with you, Biden could be doing a whole lot more than he is. However, abstaining from voting leads to an even worse timeline."
15-4-3-1-4,"This is the reason why Republicans have been consistently winning for decades now. Republican voters know how to compromise. A lot of them didn't want to vote for Trump, but they sucked it up and did anyways. Regardless of all the infighting and anything else they will show up at the booth and vote R down the ballot. This is something democrats simply cannot comprehend. Either I get exactly what I want or I don't vote at all."
15-4-3-1-4-1,Weird how it’s never compromise with the left wing voters though. We always have to come to the centrists.
15-4-3-1-5,>There are too many with the mindset of “I didn’t get everything I wanted so I’m not going to vote”.Just say progressives because progressives are the only ones on the left who do this crap and fuck the rest of us over.
15-4-3-1-5-1,Centrist do nothing candidates have been fucking us over for 50 years
15-4-3-1-5-2,"It got overshadowed by yesterday's a news, but Reuters had a story [Hispanic voters lose faith in Democrats over inflation] which had this interesting perspective:>Aguirre, 43, usually votes for the Democratic Party. But with inflation hitting a 40-year high in February he has a stark warning for Democrats as they seek to keep control of the U.S. Congress.>>""If the Republican Party has something better to offer us, I will vote Republican,"" said Aguirre. Republicans, he believes, are generally better economic stewards who could have more success in reducing prices.While Mr. Aguirre could be some extremely online progressive, he comes off more like an uninformed mainstream voter."
15-4-3-2,The ones promoting this messaging will do mental backflips to somehow blame the Dems for every ill they perceive while the Reps pillage and burn everything in sight.
15-4-3-3,"Obama said he’d codify roe v wade into law and didn’t. Hillary chose a pro life VP and lost to Donald fucking Trump. RBG decided to be selfish and didn’t retire. Biden has shown no want to pack the courts so things like this don’t happen in the future. Why should anyone bother fighting for Democrats when they don’t fight for us? This party is so content by being walked over by fascists it’s embarrassing.You say that with Republicans in power none of this will be fixed, well Democrats are in power right now and they’re still not being fixed or prevented. No one’s asking for sunshine and rainbows (we know they’re not capable) but the Democrats can’t even do the bare fucking minimum."
15-4-3-4,Just got back from the centrist rally. Lots of energy behind their rallying cry “Better things aren’t possible!”
15-4-3-5,">Too bad the voters are determined to punish the Democrats for not making everything sunshine and rainbows in 17 months.A single ray of sunshine or a single color from a rainbow would be nice.We got a must pass covid relief bill (that had the amount reduced), a corporate friendly infrastructure bill that came at the sacrifice of any human infrastructure Biden promised, and a pretty good Scotus justice.But we are also not seeing is any substantive response to the Trump administration's crimes or the Jan 6th insurrection. Sure there are hearings but until something actually comes of them, the Trump administration has got off Scott free.And unfortunately the media is not helping Biden out on his foreign policy successes. They painted the Afghanistan withdrawal as a debacle and keep asking why we are not doing more (implying direct conflict) in the Ukrainian invasion. That is tainting voter perspective."
15-4-4,"/r/voteDEM to protect freedom of choice this November; it’s a long slog of a fight, and Republicans are willing to sacrifice everything else just to force women to give birth even when raped or not readyIncidentally, Republicans are also aborting our future by doing nothing about climate change"
15-4-5,"And with Republicans rallying, voters will most likely elect Republicans.Hate to say it, but Democrats just dont care that much about voting compared to Republicans who *always* vote."
15-4-5-1,Gerrymandering and republican activist justices make voting in blue areas actively difficult.
15-5,"Write the bill, pass it through the House and watch it die in the Senate, but do this before the November election so voters have a chance to see which Senators voted it down and hopefully replace them."
15-5-1,Actually. It already happened. There's a bill that Manchin is blocking right now.
15-5-1-1,We'll see if Collins changes her mind?  I can't wait to hear her limp excuses.
15-5-1-1-1,"Initial reports indicate that she's ""very concerned."""
15-5-1-1-1-1,"We're getting an update just now... yes... okay... This just in: Collins ""heart goes out"" to those women effected. Our source told us ""thoughts and prayers"" are likely on the agenda next"

15-5-1-1-1-1-1-2,"Everybody wants to fix ""affected"" but no one wants to fix the missing possessive apostrophe.Grammar Nazis slacking these days"
15-5-1-1-1-1-2,"Unfortunately, it turns out thoughts and prayers aren't in the constitution"
15-5-1-1-1-1-2-1,"As a matter of fact, prayers are specifically not included in the constitution (to make laws by )"
15-5-1-1-1-2,Some even say a brow has been furrowed
15-5-1-1-1-2-1,"Henceforth this time shall be known as ""The Great Brow Furrowing of 2022""."
15-5-1-1-1-3,But is she monitoring the situation?
15-5-1-1-2,Call Collins and remind her that she is protecting rapists and pedophiles who currently hold office and are appointed to SCOTUS.That woman supports anti-Women legislation and individuals: she EXCUSED Trump and Kavnaughs sexual assault accusations saying “they learned”.Susan Collins of Maine protects rapists and child predators.Edit: 
15-5-1-1-2-1,I don’t want to brag or anything but I didn’t need to sexually assault anyone to learn it was wrong
15-5-1-1-2-2,I dont get the impression she gives a shit
15-5-1-2,Manchin and 50 other senators with R next to their name.
15-5-1-3,What do you mean when you say Manchin is blocking it?
15-5-1-3-1,Manchin is a relatively conservative member of the Senate. Since the majority is so slim (50/50 with the VP as tiebreaker) every single Democrat needs to vote in lockstep.That said blaming Manchin here is a little dishonest. The 50 Republican Senators are much more responsible and it wouldn't pass even with Manchin's support.
15-5-1-3-1-3,"> The 50 Republican Senators are much more responsibleYes, but as we know, if 96-98% of Democrats vote *for* something and 100% of Republicans vote *against* it, then the fault for that thing's failure *clearly* lies at the feet of Democrats."
15-5-1-3-1-3-1,"If every Senator went back and polled their constituency as to how they should vote on this then the vote wouldn't even be close. It might even be a veto-proof majority in favor of protecting RvW.I mean HONEST polling. Not just ""poll the people who I know agree with the GOP talking points."""
15-5-1-3-1-3-2,They know hoping for a Republican's support is a waste of time and effort which would be better spent in that 4-2% you might be able to sway. You can't use logic to get someone out of a position they never used logic to arrive at in the first place
15-5-2,"Already written, passed and dead in the Senate, last year: "
15-5-2-1,can’t they just keep doing it? Is there a rule that they can’t bring the same bill to the senate weekly/monthly just to keep forcing a vote on it.
15-5-2-1-1,"They never vote on it in the senate because of the filibuster. They need 60 votes to move to vote on it. Manchin/Sinema won't allow a rule change to get that number to 51 votes. So what is happening is the house passes the bill, then the senate says ""let's vote to vote on this bill, the threshold is 60 votes"" and it fails so they never *actually* vote on the bill.You can keep doing this but you never get a hard vote to use against them (if that would even help with a republican, which I doubt)."
15-5-2-1-1-1,Can’t wait for R’s to take power and change the rule to 51 the second it benefits them. Fuck Manchin and Sienna absolute traitors
15-5-2-1-1-1-1,"You have to remember that Republicans don't have laws to pass. They legislate in two areas. 1. By stacking courts with far right judges. 2. By sliding tax breaks for the rich into spending bills. Everything else is to do nothing. Why pass any laws when the courts will ""fix"" them for you? They're plenty happy to allow the courts to go back and change every social advancement we've seen for the last 100 years."
15-5-2-1-1-1-1-2,"Oh, they definitely pass laws. There are currently around [300 anti-LGBTQ+ laws in the works from Republicans], most of them aimed at transgender children. They love passing laws (or at least trying to) when it harms demographics they don't like."
15-5-2-1-1-1-2,"The problem is they don't need to change the filibuster for any of their terrible ideas. That said, with abortion on the chopping block, I can see them making that choice. And then like they did with the ""Biden Rule"" (which was bullshit to begin with), they'll cite Dem lawmakers who argued to get rid of the filibuster as part of their reason that they must do it when it benefits them."
15-5-2-1-1-2,"Even if they did get around the filibuster, there are not 50 pro-choice senators.  You have 48 pro-choice dems plus a slim chance with Collins.  Manchin and Bob Casey (PA) are anti-choice."
15-5-2-1-1-2-1,"Supposedly Collins, Murkowski, and Shelley Capito of West Virginia are pro choice:"
15-5-2-1-1-2-2,Murkowski is pro choice I believe.
15-5-2-1-2,"I presume it's never been votes on in the Senate because it's failure in light of the filibuster is a foregone conclusion. That would have to happen first for this bill to stand any chance whatsoever.Basically the long and the short of it is we have a political party, Republicans who are now fully on board with voting together in lockstep with literal insurrectionists among themselves, but democrats don't have 50 votes at present to agree on just about anything other than judicial appointments.If the Republicans manage to get a Congressional trifecta again, they will nuke the filibuster immediately. That's in as much as Roe's death was, inevitable at this point.Then hoo boy that's when it gets super regressive. The pedal will be at the floor at that point for Republicans to roll back voting rights, marriage equality, racial equality, etc..."
15-5-2-1-2-1,"They'll kill medicaid, nuke Social Security for anyone younger than 40, and remove all contraception."
15-5-2-1-3,Yes they can
15-5-2-2,"This is my favorite thing about Reddit, we’re constantly screeching about Democrats “not doing anything” or “not trying” or “not wanting to win” or “not messaging hard enough” but it’s like… *nobody* on this damned website remembers  that this happened (if they were ever aware of it to begin with).   Their algorithm doesn’t show them pro-Dem efforts (even the failed ones), therefore it doesn’t exist.I was on Twitter for like a week before I had to turn it off, just a few Dems I was following were absolutely blowing up my phone at all hours of the day, aggressively doing exactly what Reddit is oblivious of and claims they are not.  From what I can see, the Dems are actually fighting tooth and nail on like 500 different fronts with what little power and support they have, and Reddit yawns"
15-5-2-2-1,"We’re fighting multi-front battles against the algorithms, the bots, and the both-sidesing media"
15-5-2-2-1-1,"I don't follow anybody on Twitter, yet every day I'm *bombarded* with far-right commentators. I have never ""liked"" a single one of their tweets, and I rarely even open them, but yet this is what I'm notified of. I'm clearly very left-leaning, I've liked plenty of tweets from Democrat policitians, so why the fuck does the magic algorithm keep feeding me this utter shit? To make me angry at their stupidity? Anybody who claims that twitter is somehow ""silencing"" conservative voices seriously hasn't had my experience."
15-5-2-2-1-1-2,"""the magic algorithm"" is not designed to get you to ""like"" things; it is designed to get you to spend more time on the platform. Anger is very good for that."
15-5-3,"This is exactly what they should do. Keep the pressure up, starting today. No brakes."
15-5-3-1,"This is the kind of GOP bullshit I think people are (hopefully) underestimating changing the landscape of the midterms before Nov.  Everyone's so convinced the GOP is going to clean house, and they might, but also they're very good at pissing off million upon millions of Americans, which is a great motivator to vote.We just need to show the fuck up to vote, because the GOP base sure as shit will."
15-5-3-1-1,"Oh, I thought that the GOP would take the house and senate and then the presidency, but, now? With this potential ruling? …I’m not too sure.There’s a huge chasm between pretending morality and being forced to live morally. I can imagine a LOT of Republican and right leaning independent voters saying “too far” when faced with a crumbling fantasy and being forced to walk the talk."
15-5-3-1-1-1,A quarter of women have abortions. Most are married. Many are for health reasons.Some of those women are Christian hypocrites who will still vote to ban abortion. But tu have to figure some are Republicans who will quietly vote Democrat because deep down they know an abortion salvaged their future or straight up saved their life.
15-5-3-1-1-1-1,"The fact that many of the Republican bans that are Based on Texas have no exceptions for  rape, incest, ectopic pregnancies or medical emergencies shows you that they aren’t about anything other than forcing their religious beliefs onto everyone else."
15-5-3-1-1-1-1-1,"The ectopic thing blows my mind. For those who don't know, that's when the fetalized egg implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. So it WILL kill the mother and obviously the fetus is not going to make it either. And 1 in 50 pregnancies will have one so basically these states want a shit ton of women to die. And consider that many people who have an ectopic actually want to be parents, so afterwards they will likely try again.And of course the rape thing... you shouldn't force someone to carry their rapist's baby to term. What the fuck is wrong with people?"
15-5-3-1-1-1-1-2,"I’m a survivor of an ectopic pregnancy that left one of my ovaries scarred and mangled. I was in the Army at the time, so the military paid for my “abortion.”Is it even an abortion if it’s a clump of cells killing you from inside a Fallopian tube? Not even in the uterus or remotely viable. I’m feeling the Christian love knowing that my life was expendable. Getting out of TX is my number one goal at the moment."
15-5-3-1-1-1-1-3,"Ectopic pregnancy without abortion is a death sentence. They are literally telling women to go die, and it's insane that's getting glossed over"
15-5-3-1-1-1-2,> But tu have to figure some are Republicans who will quietly vote Democrat because deep down they know an abortion salvaged their future or straight up saved their life.Neither forward thinking nor reflection on the past are their strong suit.  [Hence the shit described here.]
15-5-3-1-1-1-2-1,"Also these are the kind of people to kick the ladder out from under them, sure it may have saved THEM but who gives a shit about poor people?"
15-5-3-1-1-1-3,"And many conservative Christians claim late term abortions are the problem, and the facts are that in almost every case a late term abortion is performed due to medical reasons.If you think about it logically, what kind of women would wait 6 months and then randomly decide ""you know what, nevermind I don't want this child."""
15-5-3-1-1-1-3-1,Oh! I know the answer to this! None. None women would do this.
15-5-3-1-1-1-3-2,South Park literally did an episode about this when Clinton was still in office. Too bad Cartman's Mom wasn't able to get her 105 month abortion.
15-5-3-1-1-1-4,"Those ""godly Christian"" women don't get abortions. They get a necessary medical procedure called a ""dilation and curettage.""They'll be shocked and horrified when the procedure they need isn't available. They'll still somehow lack the awareness to realize they supported this."
15-5-3-1-1-1-5,"Yeah, these people are still getting abortions despite the laws passed. They just don’t want you to get one."
15-5-3-1-1-2,">I can imagine a LOT of Republican and right leaning independent voters saying “too far” when faced with a crumbling fantasy and being forced to walk the talk.I wouldn't be *too* sure. I work with a level headed ""independent,"" and he voted for Trump twice, despite him agreeing he's probably one of the worst things to happen to our country. His big line in the sand is the second amendment, so it's always the ""devil you know."" (Although he is pro-choice too, he falls into the camp that doesn't believe the government should have autonomy over a woman)I hope you're right, but the people that voted for him a second time, likely still won't change."
15-5-3-1-1-2-1,So he’s a republican who recognizes how shitty that label is abs avoids it. He’s independent the same way North Korea is a democracy
15-5-3-1-1-2-2,"> he falls into the camp that doesn't believe the government should have autonomy over a womanI would ask that you show him [this map of all the states] where the government **will immediately** have autonomy over a woman's body when the opinion is officially released.  Then, ask him if he thinks they'll stop there or if contraceptives or same sex marriage are safer than *Roe v. Wade* was, because they're both from the same right to privacy and were explicitly mentioned in the draft opinion.Edit: alternatively, [this map from CNN] if he already has a negative perception of Planned Parenthood."
15-5-3-1-1-3,> being forced to live morallynot being able to access abortion =/= 'being forced to live morally'.there's nothing immoral about having an abortion. we shouldn't play into their paradigm by speaking about it as if there is.
15-5-3-1-1-4,There's a lot of blame with old white men but there's a growing segment of women like ACB who actually believe in all of this stuff.  I've seen multiple IG/tiktok accounts ran by women who legit think they shouldn't be allowed to vote.  This ideology runs deep and in places you wouldn't expect.Also - does it really matter if Dems hang onto their slim margins?  There's enough center right democrats to piss in the cheerios for the foreseeable future and also no apparent political will to end the filibuster.  With small red states sending two senators the dems are never going to reach a super majority
15-5-3-1-2,"Yeah like, republicans think the election is stolen. And only two democrats are blocking useful legislation. Not voting D is a vote for fascism"
15-5-3-1-2-3,"Its also gotten to the point where people are exhausted of this being the best reason to vote. Dems have underperformed for people when they have had the chance. There’s life fatigue, and the reality is inflation is blasting people under the Dems despite half the money printed done under Trump.Edit: to summarize, “the lesser of two evils” argument isnt good enough anymore. People are giving up on the system (voting) and we all know republicans win when that happens."
15-5-3-1-2-3-1,"The nice side effect of Republican policy is that over the pandemic most covid deaths has been some of the most hardcore Republican supporters and to no one’s surprise Democrat supporters are more likely to survive covid post vaccine and suffer less of the harsh side effects of covid. So it should be easier to overcome Republican voters than ever before. You would also hope some of them figured out how much the gop hates them after how they pushed for the pandemic to be handled and libertarians should still be shitting their pants over trump firing the ppp oversight board allowing businesses to effectively steal their taxes, but idk maybe that’s just me hoping we can keep pushing for change."
15-5-3-1-2-3-2,">Its also gotten to the point where people are exhausted of this being the best reason to vote.People better start waking the fuck up and realize, abortion is only the beginning.  And those of you too tired to vote, don't worry, if Republicans get their way, you probably won't need to anymore, then you won't need to worry about your exhaustion.This is the kind of statement made by people that simply think most of this shit won't affect them personally.  Virtually every minority group's rights are under attack in this country, and they are under attack by Republicans.  If that's not enough motivation to vote, then enjoy the America Republicans create."
15-5-3-1-2-3-2-2,A vote for Democrats isn't a vote against fascism. At best it's a vote for delaying fascism. Unfortunately when it comes to electoral politics these are essentially the options: fascism now or fascism in a bit.
15-5-3-1-2-3-2-3,They’re under attack by democrats and republicans. Have you not seen how much police budgets have been raised under Biden?
15-5-3-1-2-3-2-4,Berating people is a sure fire way of galvanizing them into action.
15-5-3-1-2-3-3,"Maybe don't base your motivation to vote on the doings of a political party.Because you'll always be disappointing, and those that want to fuck with our system will benefit heartily from your apathy, if not stoke it.Voting is our way of selecting our reps in our representative government, not picking our favorite teams or falling in love.  It's just a lever we pull inside *our* system.If it means voting dem for a bit because *our democracy* needs us too, I think I can manage.  Many other Americans have sacrificed a whole lot more than that just to give us the freedom to vote."
15-5-3-1-2-3-3-1,Even if 3rd party
15-5-3-1-2-5,"Correct, everyone not voting blue, not only those voting republican, is *actively* supporting fascism. You don’t vote democrat, you support fascism and the dismantling of american democracy. It actually is this simple and clear-cut. Because not voting or wasting your vote on a third party candidate *only* and *directly* benefits the fascists. And every single republican is a fascist."
15-5-3-1-3,I don’t get how or why people think the GOP is going to sweep the election? Is it because of history or is this some sort of self fulfilling prophecy?
15-5-3-1-3-1,Both.  Democrats are bad at midterm turnouts.  The president's party tends to lose the midterm.  And propagandists are working 24/7 to repeat the message in order to depress Democratic enthusiasm to make sure it stays true.
15-5-3-1-3-2,Because Democrats and Biden have low approval ratings right now and Republicans (historically) vote very well in mid term elections. The opposition party usually does well in mid term elections overall.
15-5-3-1-3-2-1,"It’s so upsetting to me that Biden has the approval rating he has. It was daily, daily that Trump said something that wasn’t right. His support of dictators including Putin alone should have made his support like zero (I shouldn’t have to decide whether my president’s admiration for Duterte or Putin is better or worse).I only hear about Biden maybe once a week? And like this time he’s on the right side of history. I mean the last controversial statement he’s made was just saying straight out that Putin is a war criminaI? I hope the pollls are way off what us voters will actually do."
15-5-3-1-3-2-1-1,"During trump presidency gas prices were low! During Biden, gas prices high!This is literally the argument people are making and one of the main reasons for his low approval rating. Not to mention inflation. Does Biden have any direct control over this? Absolutely not."
15-5-3-1-3-2-1-2,">I only hear about Biden maybe once a week?And that's the crux of the issue. Voter approval isn't a full-scale evaluation of a politician, it's a quick check of ""did they say what I wanted to hear this week"". Trump's approval lasted as long as it did because he was constantly saying things his base wanted to hear, or burying the things they didn't want to hear under things they did.In the modern era, if you aren't constantly feeding the public tidbits that they like, they'll turn on you. Even if the tidbits are lies."
15-5-3-1-3-2-1-3,You're clearly not listening to Fox News.
15-5-3-1-3-2-1-4,"The main stream media has jumped from one outrage to another and blamed Biden. High gas prices? Biden….no reporting on the fact that crude is relatively inexpensive, or that oil companies are making record profits because they’ve inflated their margins on gas/petrol.They jumped off of Covid and onto gas/inflation as soon as Covid was under control.They’ll keep doing it. Honestly, I think they miss the daily outrage from trump."
15-5-3-1-3-3,Traditionally the opposite side to the President pick up seats (traditionally)
15-5-3-1-3-4,"It's history, the party not in power traditionally gains seats in the mid terms. It can be mitigated to some degree, like in 18 when Trump's approval rating bumped up and the R's lost the house but held the senate.I think it's possible overturning Roe v Wade could galvanize Dem voters somewhat but we'll see if it's enough."
15-5-3-1-3-5,"Because gas prices are high and people are fundamentally dumb and don’t realize oil companies control gas prices, not the President."
15-5-3-1-4,Nobody can clinch defeat in the eyes of victory like political parties. Republicans are exceptional at it.
15-5-3-1-4-2,"republicans? they're awesome at winning, which sucks, but they're great at it. THeyre are minority party in the process of undoing lots of individual freedoms. they're incredibly successful at getting the most out of every victory, shit, they damn near kept the white house last time through a coup and 100% will do it next chance they get again. Democrats are the blundering dipshits. Could've run a popular progressive agenda but Pelosi would've had to be slightly less of a predatory capitalist so they punt on popular legislation and just do dumb shit like kneel in dashikis or whatever. fuckin losers. we need a real leftist party."
15-5-3-1-4-2-1,"Democrats are trying to build a house, Republicans are trying to tear it down. Nothing ""blundering"" about having beams maliciously dropped every time you go to put the next wall up. Simply impossible to make progress on jobs that take more than one person."
15-5-3-1-4-2-1-1,"Good analogy but let’s expand it. Democrats are building a shitty house that will also fall down soon. Obamacare anyone? Force more money to private companies?I don’t give them a lot of credit for building shit houses, fucking Biden doesn’t believe in Medicare for all, they could absolutely do way more than they are, but they do not want to. They are capitalists. They believe in maintaining current class structure. They are for sustainable exploitative growth. And yeah, when you compare that to republicans being absolute maniacs, it’s the only sane choice. But they’re absolutely part of the problem."
15-5-3-1-4-2-1-2,"Remember the end of Animal Farm when they couldn’t tell the difference between the pigs and the farmers anymore?  I’m that way about republican and Democratic Party leadership, what’s the difference?"
15-5-3-1-5,"Oh the disenfranchised ""authentic left wing people"" posts have already started.I've seen posts blaming Hillary and Obama for Roe falling today with ""It just doesn't pay to vote!""Its time to ignore reddit for the next 9 months."
15-5-3-1-5-1,"While voting is def importantWe need to see that the dems have fucked up every chance they are given so farThey are intent on winning the election and nothing further.At some point you look like a fool urging for voting when its not actually doing shit.That point is not yet here, but its way closer then people are treating it as.We need to hold the dems accountable for their shit."
15-5-3-1-5-2,"Eh, moderates really hard fucked Up the elections and that includes Hillary and Obama. theyre Not directly at fault, of course, thats the republicans. But conservative ""lets Just keep doing everything the Same way""- politics eventually disenfranchises the people for which the status quo doesnt Work and makes them easy Picking for right wing extremists.If you lose elections to someone Like Donald Trump after 8 years of being in Power then you Messed up"
15-5-3-1-5-3,Do you at least acknowledge that RBG fucked up and should have done what Breyer has done?
15-5-3-1-5-3-1,What value does blaming a dead person bring to anyone? Republicans have acted in bad faith repeatedly over the last 10 years when it comes to the court. We should blame their bad faith efforts rather than a dead Supreme Court justice who felt that she was still able to fulfill her duty.
15-5-3-1-5-3-1-1,">What value does blaming a dead person bring to anyone? Republicans have acted in bad faith repeatedly over the last 10 years when it comes to the court. We should blame their bad faith efforts rather than a dead Supreme Court justice who felt that she was still able to fulfill her duty.No, we should blame the Democrats for not convincing RBG that her push-ups weren't sufficient to counter the bad faith efforts of the Republicans. If your opponent keeps effing you over, it's your fault if you keep trying to take the ""high road""."
15-5-3-1-5-3-1-2,"RBG was addicted to power, and she should have relinquished it. I think this is something where George Washington set a really good precedent and more people should follow his example. RBG bears some responsibility here and we have to hold dead politicians accountable for their screwups."
15-5-3-1-5-3-2,When was RBG supposed to retire exactly? The GOP wouldn’t let Obama seat Garland. They stalled that forever.I think she was hoping she could make it til the next Dem made it into the presidency.But ultimately any system that hangs on the health of an 80+ year old person is a fundamentally broken system. Shouldn’t come down to all rest on her shoulders.
15-5-3-1-5-3-2-1,"When the Democrats held a majority in 2013, and [Obama specifically requested she do so.]"
15-5-3-1-5-3-2-3,Perhaps retiring in her 70s would have worked.
15-5-3-1-5-3-3,What insane bullshit is this?
15-5-3-1-5-3-3-1,"it's called whataboutism, as in ""sure the republicans are evil monsters hell bent on taking away our rights, but WHAT ABOUT the one supreme court justice who could have used her crystal ball to know exactly the right time to retire because she knew that republicans would ignore precedent and the rule of law?""  that's the kind of insane bullshit this is.  just ignore it."
15-5-3-1-5-3-4,So McConnell would have been able to hand Trump two stolen seats instead of one? RBG would have had to retire in 2010 for Obama to have an opportunity to appoint anyone even remotely as liberal.
15-5-3-1-5-3-4-1,"She would've had 17 years on the court if she had done so. I think the real answer is RBG had faith in the constitution, not in the Democratic party. I have more faith in the Democrats these days. I think that was true for me in 2010 too."
15-5-3-1-5-4,"This is precisely why liberalism rightly gets blamed for the rise of fascism. You see terrible material conditions that cause waves of anger that the right wing has zero qualms about riding into authoritarian power, and what do you do? Turn to those who, year after year, hold their noses and vote for your corporatist goons that are a huge part of the problem, and blame them for the current mess we're in.Progressives didn't rat-fuck Bernie in 2016 leading to a massive amount of apathy and disinterest in the Democratic party. Progressives didn't run a ""it's my turn now hehe can't wait to win"" campaign. Progressives didn't do exactly fucking NOTHING with a supermajority. Stop fucking whining and backbiting and look at the ghouls you keep telling us to vote for that are doing literally nothing to stop all this when we know exactly what needs to be done."
15-5-3-1-5-4-1,Bernie lost because he didn’t get enough votes.Bernie did shittily with POC.Get over it.
15-5-3-1-5-4-1-2,"Do you not remember the period before March 2020. I know that it seems like everything before March 2020 was a lifetime ago, but before the consolidation behind Biden, Bernie was winning and doing extremely well with POC. So your statement is just demonstrably false from the historical record."
15-5-3-1-5-5,"Aw shit, the bots are waking up huh?"
15-5-3-2,We have nothing but Susan Collins and ourselves to blame for this.
15-5-3-2-1,"Susan Collins released a statement today that said basically ""b-b-b-but Gorsuch and Kavanaugh promised me they wouldn't overturn Roe!"" Which, fuck you Collins, you're either a self-serving liar or an idiot rube of the highest degree."
15-5-3-2-1-2,All 3 of the Trump nominees said under oath in front of Congress that Roe was settled law. They all lied but it didn't matter. They had the votes.
15-5-3-2-1-3,"Maybe a law should be passed that says, Supreme Court picks should be held accountable for lying to Congress and the American people.  Oh and get rid of LIFETIME appointments."
15-5-3-2-2,I put a little blame on RBG sadly.
15-5-3-2-2-1,We have a problem with letting old people remain relevant for far to long.
15-5-3-2-2-3,Worked until she died and we are paying for it… sad.
15-5-3-2-2-4,"A little? No, she wanted to protect her legacy instead of doing the right thing which would have protected  Roe by making sure it was an Obama appointment. So now here we are with RGB’s legacy in tatters because it was really vanity and Roe about gone."
15-5-3-2-3,"In the last 18 hours I've heard that this is: Bernie Sander's fault, Justice Ginsburg's fault, Libertarian's fault(lol), Progressive's fault, and non-voter's fault.Why aren't we blaming the 5 justices, *and Susan Collins*, whose fault this actually is?"
15-5-3-2-3-1,"Probably the same reason you would blame someone for throwing a child into a pit filled with scorpions or someone else for ignoring the child being pushed but not the scorpions who end up stinging the kid.Poisonous bugs are exactly what they look like, but people you should expect reasonabiluty and caution towards poisonous bugs from letting you down so badly is a special sort of frustrating.Republicans being in the wrong is established and goes without saying to most people upset by this. We've known Republicans are in the wrong on this for fifty years. It's a different sort of frustration, however, to see people who should care about this ignoring how they helped set the stage for this to happen and promising to do it again.Republicans are bad, but they could have been stopped if certain people actually cared about stopping them.Everyone blames the justices who voted for this, but there's more than enough responsibility to go around."
15-5-3-2-3-2,Because that goes without saying.
15-5-3-3,No brakes? How about nothing is sacred anymore? They want to play dirty? Do it back to them. Let’s find ways to get Fox and other conservative media banned off the air. Let’s find ways to shove their politicians’ tricks and failures into voters’ faces. Let’s get detectives to scour their personal affairs and online comments and keep them under constant PR attack.It’s time to end this being nice crap.
15-5-3-4,Talking points:This is an attack on body autonomy.This will open the door for forced vasectomies on men.Domestic violence will explode.Adoption agencies will be overwhelmed.
15-5-3-5,This never works though. This whole “shame the republicans by doing meaningless voting” has been played hundreds of times. GOP keeps getting re elected.
15-5-3-5-1,Republicans don't want to actually debate abortion. Sure it's an issue that fires up their base but 60% of Americans think it should be legal.
15-5-3-5-2,"It's not about shaming the GOP, at least in the instance.It's to have the talking point of ""for anyone who says the parties are the same, here is a very clear distinction"". Republicans have ruled the last year with talking points and democrats don't seem to understand that."
15-5-3-5-2-2,But their talking points are mostly made up. there's no point in wasting time on a vote you know will fail just so you can say it failed. We all know it will. We know where they stand on the issue.Democrats just need to stop being coy and start calling them fascists and pedophiles and give them the examples. Just fucking fight. That's all it is.
15-5-3-5-2-2-1,"I don't think you realize how many people in this country truly hate politics. And how you need to beat it into their skulls that there is a difference between the two parties. Even if that means hold a vote that will go nowhere.Republicans pass sham laws all the time; it's literally DeSantis whole game plan. Yeah, the law will probably be overturned but he moves the needle. Democrats need to start moving the needle."
15-5-3-5-3,"That’s the exact kind of defeatist attitude that lets them get elected (among other reasons).Sure it’s a shit option, but not voting will only ensure republicans sweep. The options are shit and straight up evil so not voting is going to get you the worse of the two.Now if you want real change we’re going to have to do more than just voting, we have to help candidates that support our values, help change things locally, harass your representatives to do things to help their constituents. Voting is simply the bare minimum for changing things, but it’s still a vital part."
15-5-3-5-3-1,“All evil needs is for good to do nothing”
15-5-3-5-3-1-2,You really butchered that quote.
15-5-3-5-3-1-3,Quotation marks are not required when you make up your own paraphrase.
15-5-3-5-3-2,Wasn't this the same logic around impeaching Trump? Make them vote on record? Does the GOP base care? Absolutely not. Do most voters care? Most voters aren't paying attention
15-5-3-5-3-3,">Sure it’s a shit option, but not voting will only ensure republicans sweepThat's why conservatives help upvote most of the bullshit that comes out of the r/aoc sub and r/LateStageCapitalism sub about the real problems are Biden and Pelosi (and they never dare post Biden's accomplishments so far because they're actually very impressive)."
15-5-3-5-3-4,"""we have to help candidates that support our values""That won't ever happen for me in a two party system."
15-5-3-5-3-5,Or cut out the middle man and vote 3rd party
15-5-3-5-4,"Last time I didn’t vote, republican won. Last time I did vote, Democrat won. That easy."
15-5-3-5-5,Guess we should just give up then.
15-5-3-5-5-1,"Yep.  I'm as liberal as they come, but since Biden didn't cancel my student debt, I'm going to vote Republican.  That way I'll still have my student debt AND I'll lose all of my civil liberties. Win-Win!^(/s)"
15-5-3-5-5-1-1,Can't worry about student debt while you're working in the concentration camps!  <points at head>
15-5-3-5-5-1-2,"Yeah, I don’t get the logic.  Voting rights is the single most important piece of legislation than anything else, that needs to pass.  If we don’t have that, kiss everything else goodbye."
15-5-3-5-5-1-3,"Keep running that rat race. Republicans will always be the boogey man while you simply must vote Democrat to ensure the lesser of two evils. Does a fantastic job of keeping the status quo, being that both parties are seemingly just opposite sides of the same coin."
15-5-3-5-5-1-3-1,"There are a limited number of options in front of you. Reforming the entire system would be awesome, but it's not going to happen any time soon.You can only choose from what's available. One party is decimating the country and there is only one group who can stall them. It's a bad situation, but it's how it is."
15-5-3-5-5-2,"Why does ""we need to try a different strategy"" translate into ""we should just give up"" to you?"
15-5-3-5-5-2-1,Because they didn’t say anything about trying a different strategy.
15-5-3-5-5-2-1-1,"“ Now if you want real change we’re going to have to do more than just voting, we have to help candidates that support our values, help change things locally, harass your representatives to do things to help their constituents. Voting is simply the bare minimum for changing things, but it’s still a vital part."""
15-5-3-5-5-2-1-2,And they didn't say anything about giving up either. Just that the currently strategy of hoping the GOP will be humilated at the ballot isn't working.
15-5-3-5-5-4,"Shits rigged, we're all just pawns to them"
15-5-4,Susan Collins promises she'll vote for it.  Just don't put her in a situation where she has to actually do it.
15-5-4-1,As long as she’s not the swing vote she’ll do it.
16,Biden Signs Respect for Marriage Act.
16-1,"We do not tolerate any form of bigotry. Anyone engaging in homophobia will be permanently banned.If you come across any comments that are homophobic, we encourage you to report them to us. This will help us identify and remove those accounts. Your support in promoting a positive and accepting community is greatly appreciated."
16-1-2,You really are creating a toxic environment by coming out the gate like this. Your statement is just ambiguous enough to allow you the right to ban anyone from a forum as large as r/pic that you personally disagree with. I am on your side socially but I think you need to like your name says RELAX and allow people to have opinions with out fear of you BANNING them.
16-1-2-2,Cry more about it
16-1-3,Funnily enough that's the exact wording of the new bill
16-2,"Someone correct me if I am wrong, but even with this law in effect states can still ban gay marriage. They are just forced to accept a marriage if it took place in another state where it is legal. Also, they cannot reprimand people for leaving the state to get married."
16-2-1,"If Oberfeffel is overturned:• States set guidelines• People can travel to a same-sex stateIt’s stupid that such hoops would exist, but at least this bill codifies it into law:> “This bill does not guarantee the right to marry. It makes it so that other states have to recognize same-sex marriages across state lines and that same-sex couples are entitled to the same federal benefits of any other married couple, like Social Security survivor benefits.”"
16-2-1-1,"Should just make it so you can write off the travel on your taxes. Depending on distance, it could wind up as less than 1000$. Travel to state, get quick city hall marriage,  then go back home and  do it again with all the bells and whistles. Doesnt matter that the ceremony isn't real since they're already married."
16-2-1-1-1,Still BS hoops to jump trough
16-2-1-1-2,"I think people in Northern Ireland are doing that. It’s legal here in the republic not not over the border in the north. So they come down just over the border, have the ceremony and go back and have the reception there. It annoys me a bit, their own country won’t marry them so they come to ours for that but the revenue from the big receptions goes to NI businesses. If they had the receptions down here I’d have no problem with it!!!!"
16-2-1-2,>People can travel to a same-sex stateWhat keeps them from pulling the BS states with abortion bans are doing and punishing you for it anyways?
16-2-1-2-1,"Those laws are likely grossly unconstitutional.  So long as Obergefell v Hodges stands (which isn’t guaranteed) all states have to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.  If it is overturned, it would be possible to challenge those laws on a variety of levels.Interstate commerce, which encompasses basically anything that would cross state lines, is firmly under the control of the federal government.  States which would punish people for leaving their states are almost certainly overstepping federal law.  You can’t confine people to your state, nor can you prosecute someone who has committed a “crime” in another state.This is all, of course, assuming the Supreme Court *cares* about any of this, which is still a coin toss.  Actively overriding this kind of precedent seems highly unlikely.  They’re bold and barely care about constitutionality.  But I don’t think they’re so bold as to actively overturn the Civil Rights Act.  Goddesses I hope I’m right with that"
16-2-1-3,"Well thats the consequente of uniting all states.. people have different ideals and moral values.Same is happening in Europe atm, but instead of states you have nations."
16-2-1-3-1,>people have different ideals and moral values.Sure that doesn't given them the right to impose those personal values on others though. It's called minding your damn business.Lgbt rights are human rights. No appealing to opinion will ever make laws restricting the freedom of lgbt folks just.
16-2-1-3-1-1,"Aren't the ones supporting gay marriage (in this case) doing the same to the ones opposing it?I'm certainly pro equality, I'm just stating that a common law for 2 groups of people that have different moral values always means one side forces theirs onto the other.Again, I am pro equality."
16-2-1-3-1-1-1,"I get what you’re saying, but it’s hard to argue there’s not a difference between the 2. Gay marriage being lawful where a conservative person lives has no effect on the conservative individual’s life. Not liking the theory of something that other consenting adults are doing is not a real problem. Said conservative in this situation still has all options to live however they wanted to, now just has one more option. Not allowing gay marriage actually infringes on the right of a tax paying adult to do something that other tax paying adults get to do, which is marry the tax paying adult of their choice."
16-2-1-3-1-1-2,>Aren't the ones supporting gay marriage (in this case) doing the same to the ones opposing it?How? The anti-gay side is telling the gay side that they can't get married in their state. You don't hear gay couples telling cis couples that they can't get married in their state. It seems quite clear to me that one side is imposing on the other.
16-2-1-3-1-1-3,Nope. Here's the difference.One is trying to enforce their ways upon another.One is trying to just not have that group enforce their ways on them.Simply put;  one is offensive the other is defensive.>a common law for 2 groups of people that have different moral values always means one side forces theirs onto the other.Nope! Not if all that's occurring is the removal of restrictions .
16-2-1-3-1-1-3-1,"I know that, but that's not how the people of state B see it."
16-2-1-3-1-1-4,"Can you explain your both sides point here because I don’t understand at all. Giving gay people rights is not forcing anything onto anyone lol.You don’t sound very pro equality. Your comments are more reminding me of the quote “to those accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression”"
16-2-1-3-1-1-4-1,No considering the other comments it doesn't seem to have any point.
16-2-1-3-1-1-5,"No, because one group who is denying LGBT rights goes against America’s value of the pursuit of happiness. The inclusion of gay marriage between two consenting adults does not infringe on the marriage between two straight people.Straight people are not forced to be gay married, gay people should have the same rights as straight people."
16-2-1-3-1-1-5-1,"There's a lot of different interpretations of ""the American values of pursuit of happiness"" depending on where in the US you are.I completely get your point, and I completely agree. But if the population of a state or nation disagrees your logic won't convince them."
16-2-1-3-2,"If they're legislating against things based on moral values, they're already wrong."
16-2-1-3-2-1,I'm very glad we legislated against child marriage based on moral values..
16-2-1-3-2-1-2,Child marriage is an issue because of consent. A child is unable to consent. Obviously it’s a moral issue as well but it goes a lot further than just a moral issue.
16-2-1-3-3,You shouldn't legislate based on your own personal morals in the first place. Don't like gay marriage? Don't get gay married. Your personal opinion on other consenting adults' lifestyles has no bearing on the rights and benefits they are entitled to under the law.
16-2-1-3-4,"Except in this case, all states must follow the law just signed.Because, of course, the equal protection clause exists. Whether the supreme court chooses to ignore it or not."
16-2-1-4,"What about marriages that were legally performed in a state and the state then bans gay marriage? Everything I see about this law talks about recognizing marriages performed in other states.Example: you get married in Georgia, post Obergefell. Then In the future, Supreme Court overturns Obergefell and Georgia bans same sex marriages again. Would the RMA protect your marriage since it was legally performed at the time or would you have to go get remarried in a state where it is still legal?"
16-2-1-4-1,"Obergefell can be overturned.(And still).This law stands. Which means that Georgia can deny same-sex marriage in its state, but not those performed in other states. Basically, like abortion now.(Until).This legislation is either replaced, repealed, or also voted against at the supreme court. Shockingly though, the SC seems to respect one bright red line: bipartisan legislation.As their job is to not legislate from the bench, even though they are generally hacks who have found convenient ‘originalist’ reasons to behave as if this is 49 years ago.We.Will.Overcome."
16-2-2,Destination weddings let’s goooooo
16-2-3,"I was about to say that this was just a “feel good” law, but I didn’t realize 13 states still ban same-sex marriage. That’s insane."
16-2-3-1,Even here in holy catholic Ireland we had a constitutional referendum about it and there was a landslide victory in favour of it.
16-2-3-2,I thought same sex marriage was legal everywhere in the US.
16-2-3-2-1,It has been legal in all 50 states since 2015
16-2-3-2-2,"It is now because of Supreme Court rule overriding those state laws. But if that ruling is ever overturned, those laws go back into effect."
16-2-3-2-2-1,"Ah, my mistake. Should have dove deeper than the first result on google."
16-2-4,"I just can't believe it's 2022, other countries are legalizing marijuana and have had gay marriage for years.And we're over here like ""We can't make it legal for everyone, but if someone else does you need to recognize it"""
16-2-5,Not should they reprimand people for leaving a state to get married. My god.
16-3,Me and my 4 ex-wives agree this completely destroys the sanctity of marriage.
16-3-1,"Won’t someone think of my six children that I’m letting the internet raise single-handedly!…er, wait, was it seven?"
16-3-1-2,"No, it's six now. Remember Kevin fell out of the back of your pickup during the Trump Train rally?The autopsy said it was blunt force trauma from being run over, but *you know* Ru Paul molested him to death when he watched Drag Race one time by accident."
16-3-2,All your ex-wives agree with you?? How come you got divorced you seem so compatible... 
16-3-3,"My God, that's despicable. Me and my 10 year old wife agree that this destroys the sanctity of marriage though.Obvious sarcasm, but child marriage is currently legal in 43 states (only Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island have set the minimum age at 18 and eliminated all exceptions), and 20 U.S. states do not require any minimum age for marriage, with a parental or judicial waiver. The current youngest marriages on record were 10 year old brides with a 30 year old in 2001.So... yup. That's a thing."
16-3-4,Happy cake day and good joke!
16-4,This is the gayest bill he has signed yet
16-4-1,Super fuckin gay
16-4-1-1,Congratulations my homomerican friends. Now go and make mistakes like our parents did! Live and love freely!
16-4-1-1-1,"Lol reminds me of a joke I heard where someone was saying ""why not give gay people the right to marry? Let them be miserable like the rest of us!"""
16-4-1-1-1-1,"People say it as a joke, but actually the right to marry is also the right to divorce and that's an important right to have too."
16-4-1-1-1-1-1,Henry VIII agrees.
16-4-1-1-1-1-1-2,"No entirely relevant, but I don't have a lot of places to mention it. [SIX is a great musical] about the wives of Henry VIII and would encourage anyone with the opportunity to watch a touring cast if it's coming near them.Sounded better live than the recordings, honestly, but it was fun.Anyway, as you were."
16-4-1-1-1-1-1-3,Let's keep guillotines out of it though
16-4-1-1-1-1-2,"Yeah. Lots of people talk about how high the divorce rate is, without also mentioning how women (and men) would just stay in shitty and / or abusive marriages because leaving would be scandalous.Fuck the scandals, always do what’s right for you no matter what people say. (Unless you have kids or dependents in which case they come first!)"
16-4-1-1-1-1-3,"That’s why it’s so funny when the Church of England said they didn’t want to redefine marriage. It’s like, that’s why you founded the church."
16-4-1-1-1-2,This is what my divorced aunt would always say. Lmao
16-4-1-1-1-2-1,My parents would too. Then follow it up with but just don’t call it marriage.
16-4-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Call it ""super jesus bonding"" that will really get their goat."
16-4-1-2,Fuck me right in the ass.
16-4-2,HA gayyyyyyyyyyyyy
16-4-2-1,!
16-4-2-1-1,Now you're speaking my Changuage
16-4-2-2,Community is so funny
16-4-3,This bill is so gay it lets gay people stay married.
16-4-5,I heard Biden loves and cares for his family and friends; so fucking gay.
16-5,"Ok, I go with 2 days before a suit is filed in Texas."
16-5-1,Thats preposterous. I give it 24 hrs max.
16-5-1-1,"It's already written, it'll be filled in the morning.There's guaranteed to also be someone already selected to be the plaintiff in the lawsuit that says this violated their civil rights or something. Be on the lookout for that."
16-5-1-1-1,How can I sue these people for offending me with their nonsense that arbitrarily clogs the legal system?
16-5-1-1-1-1,Because they know eventually they will win because the courts are gone
16-5-1-1-1-1-1,"This was a bipartisan bill, GOP must have realized the backlash from abortion decision and the price they paid for it.I think they will likely tell their judges (yes, it is their judges not independent) to slowdown on social issues and instead focus on cases like election issues where it will be more helpful to GOP."
16-5-1-1-1-1-1-2,"I think their tactic is going to be more, ""you can't blame me for what Biden's SCOTUS did"" when this gets brought to the Supreme Court and used to overturn Obergefell"
16-5-1-3,Absurd...pretty sure one is pending in Mississippi.
16-5-1-4,"My brother is a Qanon idiot that lives in Texas. He hates student loan forgiveness, as well as equal marriage. He's such a piece of crap, and Texas is a perfect place for him, apparently."
16-5-1-4-1,What are you getting him for xmas?
16-5-1-4-1-1,A Captain America Christmas sweater.
16-5-1-4-1-1-1,You're too kind of a person.
16-5-2,My guess is they have to overturn Obergeffel first
16-5-2-1,"Doesn't this bill already render Obergeffel irrelevant?EDIT: Guys, I get it - you can stop responding now. Thanks for all the clarification, though."
16-5-2-1-1,"No for a few reasons, Obergeffel v. Hodges specifically relates to same sex marriage and requires all states to offer same sex marriage licenses. Loving v. Virginia similarly declared all states must offer interracial marriage licenses. Together these declare only same sex and interracial marriage licenses must be offered.This new bill Respect for Marriage Act says states are no longer required to issue marriage licenses if Obergeffel and Loving are overturned, but they must respect and uphold the marriage licenses of everyone who is already married and any future marriage licenses granted in other states.So if you wanted to have an interracial marriage with a trans person in Rhode Island and move to Austin, Texas, the state of Texas needs to give you all the same legal rights and affordances as a straight white couple. But if you lived in Texas, you couldn't get married there, you'd have to travel to a different state get married, and come back."
16-5-2-1-1-1,"I love that you use Texas as an example without adding any hypotheticals to say they pass a law banning it, because it's just assumed at this point."
16-5-2-1-1-1-2,"Because pretty much all of their elected officials have stated they will enforce a ban if it Obergefell is overturned.  It’s not even implied, they are explicit."
16-5-2-1-1-2,Thanks for this info. So close and yet so far!
16-5-2-1-1-2-1,Probably as good as we're gonna get.   Those backwards people can be happy they get to hold on to their little islands of ignorance while the rest of us can simply go around them and pass them by.
16-5-2-1-1-2-1-2,And then complain and have shocked pikachu faces when their younger population flees to other places with more progressive policies
16-5-2-1-1-3,"That feels so half-assed. Why not enforce it for all states as a law, in case Obergeffel and Loving are overturned?"
16-5-2-1-1-3-1,"There's a thing in America called The Constitution. That's why.It's a pretty terrible document, but the government has to make their laws conform to it or they will be struck down."
16-5-2-1-2,Yeah I thought that was the point? Make it a law and now the SC can't reverse it
16-5-2-1-2-1,"Technically, SCOTUS could reverse Obergefell OR they could invalidate the law Biden just signed.  They have the power to do both.  Although, it would be extremely difficult for them to justify invalidating the new law at this point, as it has a fairly clear/uncontroversial constitutional basis"
16-5-2-1-2-1-2,This law makes it so that states have to recognize gay marriages from other states even if Obergefell is overturned. But states could chose to not recognize marriages in there own state.
16-5-2-1-2-2,"If SC overturns Obergefell, states can stop their own same-sex marriages, so same-sex couples in those states wanting to be married would have to do it in another state (at which point it would be recognized by all states)."
16-5-2-1-3,"No, Obergeffel goes further."
16-5-2-1-4,"Unless I missed something, this only renders marriages legal if they were legal at the time they occurred. If Obergefell is overturned and states make gay marriages illegal, then future marriages would be restricted to man/woman."
16-5-2-1-4-1,"If Obergefell falls then states can prevent gay marriages in their own state but not others, and according to this new law they must acknowledge gay marriages in other states as valid."
16-5-2-1-4-1-1,"Got it, that's helpful context."
16-5-2-1-4-1-1-1,"Not to be rude, but this is literally the entire point of the bill. It extends full faith and credit to any marriage that was legal where it happened.That is, if Obergefell gets overturned and Alabama outlaws gay marriage, LGBTQ couples can still travel to other states and get married and Alabama would be helpless to ignore their marriage under federal civil rights protections.Anyone telling you this isn't a big deal is either ignorant or purposefully lying to you."
16-5-2-1-4-2,"If it's overturned, then that would mean the decision to license would be upon the state. This bill makes it so that you could get married in one state and all other states have to honor it. That's my understanding at least."
16-5-2-1-4-2-1,"Got it, that's helpful context."
16-5-2-1-4-2-2,But if the decision is overturned it will be on the basis of federal overstep and that will mean that statutory law is also invalid.  Why is everything so stupid now?  I hate the 21st century.
16-5-2-1-5,"I don’t think so. It still lets states stop gay marriage from happening, it just forces them to acknowledge existing marriages."
16-5-2-1-5-1,And marriages that happen in states where it’s legal. Which means that destination weddings can make it happen.
16-5-2-2,"If they challenge this bill, the ruling could overrule Obergeffel."
16-5-2-2-1,They would have to overturn Loving v Virginia too.
16-5-2-2-1-2,You mean Looving. Remarkable how it pairs with Obergeffel.
16-5-3,There are coked up Lawyers who barely passed the Bar furiously working on it now I'm sure.
16-5-4,"The bill doesn’t do anything right now given that SCOTUS rules that gay marriage is constitutional.If SCOTUS reverses that, then this kicks in.So, there is literally no basis for a lawsuit right now."
16-5-4-1,">So, there is literally no basis for a lawsuit right nowSince when has that stopped anyone -_-"
16-5-4-1-2,"Well sure nothing is stopping them from filing a lawsuit, but it'll be promptly thrown out as frivolous.They have to allow same-sex marriages as it is. This law doesn't, like, make them ""extra"" have to and thus they can show some harm as basis for a lawsuit."
16-5-4-2,"Strictly speaking, the RMA officially endorses the idea that nonprofit religious groups cannot be forced to participate in same-sex weddings, with either goods or services. That's probably already a First Amendment right, but it adds Federal law to the mix independently.The contentious issue has always been public, for-profit businesses refusing services. It says nothing about that."
16-5-5,It be funny if it weren't likely true
17,71 percent don’t want Biden to run for reelection: poll
17-1,"Even if Biden was the greatest, most well-liked President ever, he would be 82 when starting the 2nd term and that is just way too old to make a 4-year commitment. He needs to retire and spend time with his family."
17-1-1,The fact that the last 2 presidents we had broke the record for “oldest at inauguration” is insane.
17-1-1-1,Retirement age of 65 should be the limit to run for President. If you’re considered too old for a regular job you sure as hell shouldn’t be running a whole country.
17-1-1-1-1,I'd like to see a 35 year old make it in
17-1-1-1-1-2,AOC turns 35 on October 13th 2024.
17-1-1-1-1-2-2,I would vote for her but I think she is too hated by the rest of the world to run for such an office so soon*edit I don’t know why I said rest of the world I meant rest of the country / other side
17-1-1-1-1-2-2-2,"Rest of the world here. We don't hate AOC. Actually, we don't even know who she is."
17-1-1-1-2,The age of 65 that was established back in the 1930s was more about payroll taxation and back then it was determined that using age 65 produced a manageable system that could easily be made self-sustaining with only modest levels of payroll taxation. Again that was 90 yrs ago. Social security and old age pensions didnt consider the US population tripling and pensions remaining sustainable to match that population growth. A lot of people 65+ in white collar jobs are still more than capable to keep their jobs. Politicians for some reason though seem to linger even though some look like crypt-keeper.
17-1-1-1-3,"It's 67 now. Personally, I don't think someone in their 60s is too old. I'd put 70 as a cutoff where after that you can't be elected or appointed, but if you hit that age while serving you can continue your term unless you're a federal judge, at which point you're require to retire at the end of the calendar year where you turn 70. South Dakota mandates retirement for our Supreme Court Justices at 70 and that does us pretty good. At that age your physical and cognitive health isn't generally a *huge* concern yet but you're getting into the territory where it could be, hence my standard allowing you to serve out your current term."
17-1-1-2,Biden is older than every President from Clinton and later. Older *now* not just when in office. The fact the US leader is a pre-Boomer is insane to me
17-1-2,Someone pointed out that Biden’s birth was closer to Lincoln’s (2nd) inauguration than his own inauguration.
17-1-2-1,"You’re right, the people who replied to your comment are wrong. 28,551 days between Nov 20 1942 and Jan 20 2021 vs. only 28,384 days between Mar 4 1865 and Nov 20 1942."
17-1-2-1-2,But Lincoln was a Republican! Scream those that have not noticed how the political parties have shifted over the years. David Packman just opined that the current Democratic party would be happy to work with the Republican party of fifteen years ago. Even though the Republicans of fifteen years ago laid the ground work for the GQP party of today.
17-1-3,Quick note that the life expectancy for males in the USA is 75.1 years
17-1-3-1,That's the life expectancy at birth. You have to specify a starting age to quote a life expectancy.
17-1-3-1-1,[The SSA data] for 2019 says a man of his age as of 01/01/2019 had an average remaining life expectancy of about 10.1-10.7 years. That'd put his estimated death in 2029. So he'd probably live long enough to finish a second term.Not that I think we should try to find out.
17-1-3-1-1-2,"Those numbers include terminally ill, sick, weak, obese, smokers, alcoholic, poor etc. people. Someone relatively healthy with the access to best possible healthcare and medical staff on 24/7 standby is going to have significantly better expectancy.I don't think anyone above age 65 should run for president, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like you guys have much options in the next elections either."
17-1-3-1-1-2-1,But imagine the amount of stress and strain in your body with the responsibility at potus. Look how grey haired Obama became and he was relatively young. Now think if he started at 82.
17-1-3-1-1-2-2,"Yep. Jimmy Carter is 97, so there's no reason to think Biden couldn't live even longer than that.  Thank God for term limits."
17-1-4,"Instead of a debate, let’s have candidates explain what WiFi is and prove they can install an app on their phone.Bonus round: They have to Google a topic and differentiate between the fake stuff and what’s actually true."
17-2,"Although I ultimately voted for him, I didn't want him to run the first time, lol."
17-2-1,The two party system....ain't it grand?
17-2-1-1,And parties were something the Founders specifically didn’t want to happen. But was/is an inevitability due to how our winners are chosen.
17-2-1-1-2,"Well, they were pretty big supporters of their wigs (sorry couldn't not throw that in there)"
17-2-1-2,Worked great for Kang and Kodos!
17-2-2,And I fully expect to do the same thing again.
17-2-2-1,Agreed. What are our choices.
17-2-2-1-1,How quickly would you like to descend into a fascist hell state? I have the slow option and the fast option.
17-2-2-1-1-1,"I'm considering the move-out-of-the-country option. Given the makeup of the SCOTUS, the president and congress are going to be largely irrelevant at this point."
17-2-2-1-1-1-1,"People don’t like to hear this, but the US has a much bigger influence on international politics than people think. Whatever dystopian shit happens in the US will eventually start to spill over in the rest of the western world. You cannot escape it, but you can delay it I guess."
17-2-2-1-2,Your choices are Christian fascist old white guy vs. neoliberal old white guy.
17-2-2-1-2-1,"We can try to primary him. But if that fails, then yeah. I’m voting for the neoliberal rather than the fascist."
17-2-2-1-2-2,Both options suck but not equally
17-2-2-1-3,The time approaches
17-2-2-1-4,People that try and fail to do the right thing. And death cult fascists.
17-2-2-1-5,Engage in non-electoral politics.  The only thing that has ever changed anything for the better.
17-2-2-2,"A sword I’m proud to fall on, again."
17-2-3,Bo Burnham really nailed everyone's sentiment on the issueLinky
17-2-3-2,Where was it he did that?
17-2-3-2-1,"""Inside"" on Netflix,  but I think the biden song was an extra track maybe?"
17-2-3-2-1-1,He released [an hour of outtakes and extras] for the one-year anniversary of Inside. It’s fantastic.
17-2-3-2-1-1-2,"Omg this is a fantastic Friday surprise, thank you!"
17-2-3-3,"I see Bo, I upvote."
17-2-3-4,Goddamn that was funny lmao
17-2-4,"If it's vs trump, I vote for trump's opponent, it really is as simple as that. That being said, fuck Biden and I don't want him near the oval office either. Maybe someone under the age of 100 this time, please..."
17-2-4-1,I will vote for any leading opposition to any Republican. The Republican Party is evil.
17-2-4-1-1,"Agreed. My personal politics are very progressive, but I'll vote for moderates for the rest of my life if the alternative is voting for a Republican."
17-2-4-1-1-2,"I actually switched my affiliation from the green party (since 1995, sigh) to democrats last year so I can actually try to be more impactful in the primaries (2020 in my district primaries the ""progressive"" candidate lost by less than 1000 votes, there are more than 1000 green party folks in my district . . . but no, we get to keep the neo lib who's held the seat for 20 years).We have to get the progressives on the actual ballot, or hell, even fighting moderates, the main thing I'm sick of is how passive the Dems are, like start naming names, impeaching and expelling literally anyone of the crooked fucks that you can get."
17-2-4-1-1-3,Same
17-2-4-1-2,I’ll vote for an aluminum rod over Trump.
17-2-4-2,If its vs. Republican (aka facist) I'm voting Democrat. Wouldclove an actual progressive though.
17-2-5,"He wasn't even in the top 5 of my choices in the Dem primary, but when it came to the general, he was the best out of the choices we had, so I voted for him.  I haven't been completely happy with him, but I still think he's doing better than Trump would have done."
17-2-5-2,Definitely better than Trump.
17-3,"61% of those didn't want Biden to run in the first place but would have voted for a dog with a name tag over trump, like myself."
17-3-1,"Shit, is dog with name tag running in 2024?! Has my vote."
17-3-1-1,"I can't wait for the debates.""Dog With a Name tag, the American people want to know ... Who is a good boy? Is it you? Are you a good boy?"""

17-3-1-2-1,Dog with nametag could spend four years licking his balls and shitting in the Oval Office and do less damage to office of the presidency than Trump.
17-3-1-2-1-1,Would cost taxpayers a lot less
17-3-1-2-1-1-1,But the cat party would not be pleased
17-3-1-2-1-1-1-2,I feel like they could get behind the ball-licking platform.

17-3-1-5,I’m wondering if Deez Nuts is gonna run again? I’d at least want to hear em out this time.
17-3-3,Shit with a name tag would’ve gotten my vote over trump.
17-4,What percentage do not want Trump to run again?
17-4-2,that wonderfully 30-40% that keeps coming back and determining everything.
17-4-3,61%
17-5,I'm going to lose my mind if it's between him or Harris vs DeSantis or Trump.
17-5-1,You’ll *also* lose your democracy so there’s that
17-5-1-1,"True, seems like after next year the Supreme Court will just let GOP-led states just choose either of the latter two without voter consent."
17-5-1-1-1,"It’s incredible to me that the supremacy clause, which is basically what we fought the civil war about (obviously it was about slavery but the mechanism was the supremacy clause) is about to be overturned by 5 justices, 4 of whom shouldn’t have ever sniffed the court."
17-5-1-1-1-1,Wouldn't the supremacy clause being over turned make the supreme court pointless?
17-5-1-1-1-1-2,"You make the mistake of assuming right-wing supreme court justices give a single fuck about self-consistency and not just craven power-grabbing: they don't need to be consistent, they don't need to to justify themselves to you or me lest they not be re-elected, they have near-unlimited power and are proceeding to use it."
17-5-1-1-2,"That is absolutely the case. We're going see violence at elections, again, between Trump, the SC giving legislatures the green light to overturn elections, and, the low key thing, the democrat-led laws that throw the electors to the popular vote winner. Yes, it's a good idea, but in the moment voters will absolutely lose their sht."
17-5-1-1-2-1,How about we play a reverse card and have Harris very legally and very coolly just select the next president because apparently the vice president can do that?
17-5-1-1-2-1-1,"It won't work, Pence wasn't to say Trump won, he was to reject the electors.  He was to prevent certification of the vote.  What they want to trigger is a contingent election in congress, each state gets equal vote, GOP controls 26 states, they win.This SCOTUS will say that it is ok and constitutional."
17-5-1-1-2-1-1-1,"To be fair, the plan to reject the electors and send them back to the states was not any more legal than a plan to simply make up fake votes and count them. The Vice President doesn't have the power to do either of those things. The ""send it back to the states"" one just *sounds* better."
17-5-1-1-2-2,"Suddenly the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact seems less and less crazy. It used to be a cool, but far fetched idea. Now it’s the kind of legal loophole we’d need."
17-5-1-1-2-2-2,The only good excuse for the Electoral College's existence was rejecting an incapable fraudulent populist.Was.
17-5-1-1-3,"Hell, Missouri's doing exactly that right now. It went to get rid of our primary and go to a caucus only. Caucuses disenfranchise voters."
17-5-1-1-5,It’s almost hilarious that originalists are reading “state legislature” using the modern definition.
17-5-1-2,Hate to break it to you but the Supreme Court is already killing democracy well before any elections happen
17-5-2,"No offense to Harris but i forget she even exists as the Vice President. In my opinion, she would have been way better in the attorney general position."
17-5-2-1,If she is the nominee the race is as good as over. And that's not a slight to her just the reality of the situation.
17-5-2-1-1,It’s definitely a slight to the person who had to drop out of the primaries before her own state. She’s just comically unpopular
17-5-2-1-1-1,She was the DNC choice. She was a fucking dud though with the voters. They had a chance to groom the next candidate and fucked it up again. The DNC can’t be relied upon to govern properly unfortunately.
17-5-2-1-1-1-2,She’s less popular than Pence and EVERYONE hates Pence. It’s the only thing both parties have agreed on in decades.
17-5-2-1-1-2,"I didn't realize how bad she comes off until I heard her recent NPR interview. She was SO defensive the whole time and constantly trying to steer the interview into what she wanted to talk about. I get that's what politics often is, but she was being so heavy handed about it that I just got frustrated that it sounded like she was completely ignoring the interviewer.And this interview was asking pretty softball questions, I can't imagine how she would be in a presidential debate or in a press briefing."
17-5-2-1-1-2-1,Heard that interview too and thought the same exact thing!!!
18,"Biden vows to defend ""literally every inch of NATO territory. Article 5 is a sacred commitment."""

18-1-1-1-1,"I thought they liked guns, doesn't this just make him look badass to their viewers?"
18-1-1-1-1-1,The right continually makes Biden look like a bad ass
18-1-1-1-1-1-2,"I wonder how far away they are from showing him riding a tank, smoking a cigar and holding two machine guns breathing flames out of his mouth."
18-1-1-1-1-2,"Yeah, they're just dumb."
18-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Please stop saying this, like it can be brushed off as stupidity. It's not. Everything they do, every hypocrisy or double standard, is designed to create the most amount of apathy and rage. It's not meant to make sense, it's meant to divide and infuriate.

18-1-1-1-1-4-2-2,"Compared to the last president, Capt'n Clown-Shoes, just being competent and qualified, like Biden, is about a 100x improvement."
18-1-1-1-2,“Putin wouldn’t have invaded Ukraine if Trump was in office because Trump would have defended Ukraine. Also Biden is bad for defending Ukraine.”
18-1-1-1-2-1,In my experience it would appear that they are somehow delighted Ukraine is being invaded by Russia.  The fact that we benefit from Ukrainian soldiers beating down our greatest rival with almost zero American lives lost in the process is completely lost on them.   It's honestly baffling.
18-1-1-1-3,I thought he was supposed to be “weak” and “trump would have never let this happen” but as soon Biden says we will defend every inch of nato territory their all like “scary Biden is a war monger” lol
18-1-1-1-3-1,Their line is that Putin would have been too pants-shitting scared of Trump to even invade Ukraine in the first place.
18-1-1-1-5,Do conservatives not like warmongers? I thought they were super into the military.
18-1-1-3,Any non fox news source? Haven't clicked the link and don't plan to support them.
18-1-1-3-1,"From this AP story with the headline ""Biden: Putin’s suspension of US arms treaty ‘big mistake’"":> He pledged that NATO’s mutual-defense pact is “sacred” and that “we will defend literally every inch of NATO.”"
18-1-2,And when it has nothing to do with the content of the article and isn't in the article?
18-1-2-2,"Yeah, it's just the thumbnail. Makes it weirder somehow"
18-1-2-2-1,**It's Fox News**
18-1-2-2-1-1,"because it's war mongering when a democrat does it!(when a republican president does it, it just means they are strong and standing up for America!)"
18-1-3,That's Dark Brandon in front of all the ARs he's pried out of cold dead fingers.
18-1-3-1,"I'm now imagining a Dark Brandon horror game where you play as a Trumper with an AR-15 trying to escape as Brandon stalks you, coming to take your guns.Shooting Brandon does nothing, but you use the gun to solve puzzles (it's just a tool, after all!)"
18-1-3-1-1,Failing puzzles builds up your Malarkey meter which draws his attention.

18-2,I live in Moldova and the tension between Moldova proper and Transnistrian separatists is slowly increasing. So it may happen that I'll see y'all soon in the trenches on the Dniester shore.
18-3,Hi.European here.We also vow to defend literally every 2.54 cm of NATO territory.o7
18-3-1,"That's a good attitude to have. You know what they say: if you gave them 2.54cm, they take 1.6km."
18-3-1-1,"It's actually a real concern. Would NATO risk a war if Russia moved the border just a few kilometres or even metres, declared it to be Russian soil and threaten with total war and nuclear annihilation if challenged?Would we risk tens of thousands dead (at a minimum) for a kilometre of Estonian land?This is why his statement is not only to be taken figuratively, but quite literally. We need to put the point of total escalation at 0, exactly to prevent any escalation that may be caused by Russia trying to find this exact point."
18-3-1-1-1,"> if Russia moved the border just a few kilometres or even metres, declared it to be Russian soil and threaten with total war and nuclear annihilation if challenged?**Russia:** *""This is where the border is; cross it and we fire the nukes""***NATO:** *""That's not the internationally recognised boundary. If you fire nukes, so will we""***Russia:** \*Doesn't use nukes***NATO:** \*Doesn't use nukes***Google:** \*Changes border location based on user's location*"
18-3-1-1-4,The vast majority of deaths would be on the Russian side in a war with NATO. Every strategic location would be rubble within a week. The US has had invasion plans drawn up since the 50s and just kept updating them.
18-3-1-1-4-1,"You're point about invasion plans made me think. Just about any nations government would have some kind of defensive plan at the very least on what to do if invaded by another country. But if anyone was going to go full paranoia Batman level of planning for the possibility of invading literally everyone if the need arises, it would be the US."
18-3-1-2,What about the remaining \~9 metres?
18-3-2,"I love this comment so much. Whether you use freedom inches or free healthcare centimeters, we are together in this!"
18-3-3,What about the first 2.53 cm?
18-3-3-1,"Thankfully, the first 2.53 cm is actually a part of the first 2.54 cm."

18-3-3-1-1-1-1,"Well played, Sir"
18-4,"I mean, isn't the the main point of NATO? And formed in the first place to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding in Europe? ""Weaker"" countries get backing from the US, Britain, and France while the ""powerful"" countries get favorable treatment from the smaller ones?"
18-4-1,My guess it is a hint to Russia that these covert operations they are running in the west won't be tolerated without reply.
18-5,"I agree, all NATO countries should have each other's backs. I'd want the assistance if I needed it, might as well give the assistance when they need jt"
18-5-1,**Finland awkwardly waving from the back corner**
18-5-1-1,If turkey and hungary keep messing around the US needs to sign seperate agreement with finland and sweden.
18-5-1-1-1,"In practical terms we got guarantees from at least the UK. Also a bilateral with the US is in preparation: At present this is more awkward than dangerous for Finland. And all thanks to Ukrainians. We have not been this safe in a long, long time. Russia emptied their bases near the border to be promptly destroyed in Ukraine. Ukrainians bought us years of safety, and for that, we owe them."
18-5-1-1-1-1,"Isn't Finland also protected by the EU's mutual defense pact? The US isn't part of that, but it's still a lot of powerful countries."
18-5-1-1-1-1-1,"And Finland has an impressive military of its own.Further, when you see the support given to Ukraine, a nation once hostile to the idea of joining the west you can only anticipate greater solidarity and support for Finland.And Russia are in position to widen the war.So pretty safe all considered."
18-5-1-1-1-2,"what do you mean ""at least"" the UK, we'd fuck Russia up dw, have you not seen our knife crime statistics?"
18-5-1-1-2,Turkey will sign.  They are just holding out for more earthquake relief.   They know without EU they are fuuuuuucked.
18-5-1-1-2-1,"NATO may wait for Erdoğan to just lose instead of sending jets and stuff, the earthquake relief will come regardless"
18-5-1-1-2-1-1,"ahhhh, good point.  Can he win with so much grift and corruption?  I pray he won't.  It time to move on from the past.  People of Turkey should demand his head on a pike (okay, that might be a little old-school)."
18-5-1-1-2-1-2,"You seem to be laboring under the assumption that Turkey has a functional democracy. They do not.The final significant obstacle Erdogan and his regime had to overcome was the Turkish military. Traditionally, as per Atatürks legacy, if a leader in Turkey becomes corrupt, the military is obligated by law to depose the corrupt regime- they've done so successfully several times in the past. Erdogan staged a fake coup against himself a few years ago to weed out any remaining opposition.While it's possible for the Turkish people to remove Erdogan, it's about as likely as Russians removing Putin. It's more likely that the wealthy elite will step up, should the situation become sufficiently bad for business. But they would need military support, which is a dangerous path, as explained above."
18-5-1-1-4,"Or all the other countries execute a document that takes effect upon everyone but Hungary and Turkey signing upon which they simultaneously leave NATO and form a new, but identical defense pact."
18-5-1-1-4-1,"The New Euro-Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NEATO."
18-5-1-1-4-1-1,"ForumRegardingIndependentEsteemedNationsDefendingLiberty,Yes"
18-5-1-1-4-1-1-1,"Pact of the Alliance of Legitimate States(not calling Hungary and Turkey illegitimate, at least not moreso than any other state, I just needed an adjective starting with L that fit somewhat)"
18-5-1-1-4-3,Doing that would undermine the meaning of the treaty and discourage others from joining. If it can just be *cancelled* when inconvenient how can it be relied upon?
18-5-1-1-4-3-1,You can be cancelled when you unreasonably condition allowing other western democracies to join because you want them to release your terrorists. I'd say anyone who doesn't plan to engage in international extortion like a fucking Bond villain should feel pretty secure.
18-5-2,That’s literally the point behind being in NATO. Common defense. Not defense when you feel like it.
18-5-2-1,"Yeah this is sort of a non-article. ""President agrees to uphold minimum obligation of long standing defence treaty"" isn't a great headline though."
18-5-4,"Plus NATO helped us with the Afghanistan invasion after 9/11. In some ways, we owe it"
18-5-4-1,9/11 is literally the only time Article 5 has ever been invoked
18-5-4-2,You freed us in WW2. It also is a weird kind of comforting feeling that the U.S protects us. Think I would be a lot more scared of Russia and this situation if you didn't have our backs.
18-5-4-2-1,">Think I would be a lot more scared of Russia and this situation if you didn't have our backs.That fear is warranted, and the reason for which is why Trump was planning to withdraw the US from NATO prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022."

18-5-4-2-1-1-2,May it stay that way for all eternity.I was so relieved when Biden was voted in.

19-5-1-1,Biden is a true gentleminion
19-5-2,"Tbh I doubt he leaves his house in anything but a suit unless the event calls for a more specific outfit, like obviously you can't wear a suit to the beach. Those of us that remember #tansuitgate know repubs will gave a field day when they see him dressed in anything else."
19-5-2-1,"Being a European, I have no idea what that is save through one or two Reddit comments - was it really republicans getting mad because Obama wore a tan suit (which he'd absolutely rock imo)?"
19-5-2-1-1,"It really was. (He did rock it). Obama was so non controversial (except for the traditional presidential war crimes that Republicans don't care about) that in order to build outrageous at the dems they had to critize every little thing, the near pinnacle of which was Obama going out in a tan suit, only bested for sheer stupidity by the outrage at him having dijon mustard on a burger instead of yellow."
20,Biden Calls Out ‘Socialist Republicans’ Now Begging for Money From Program They Voted Down
20-1,"This is called the [Two Santa Claus strategy] and Republicans have been shamelessly using it since the 1970s.Basically, they start by opposing the Democrats’ social programs (Santa #1) by accusing them of socialism. But if those programs get passed anyway, they instead embrace them and instead focus on cutting taxes (Santa #2,) which of course racks up debt. Then Santa #1 either has to take the programs away or raise taxes to prevent economic collapse, both of which make them look like The Grinch.Works very well on voters with short attention spans."
20-1-1,"Another part of this is that they also cut taxes for the rich (and claim it's a cut for everyone), which (again) looks like they're Santa Claus."
20-1-1-1,"Trump literally made a tiny middle class tax cut that was offset by cuts to services, and it was temporary to run out and go HIGHER than before, in a few years when a Democrat is in office.But the big tax cut to billionaires was permanent!His voters STILL can't figure this out?"
20-1-1-1-1,"Some just refuse to understand anything against that Traitor.He could shoot a dog in middle of times square, and get away with it."
20-1-1-1-3,">voters still can’t figureNo and they won’t and they’re hostile to democracy and they will always be a threat until they are no longer able to be.  Full stop.They’re too **stupid**, fearful and uneducated to participate in democracy, and they want it torn down because society is telling them that they’re not allowed to [redacted] people they hate.  It’s hate.  They have nothing else."
20-1-1-1-4,"They don't see it. All they see is that taxes are going up while a Democrat is in office, so they assume Dems are raising taxes."
20-1-1-1-5,It’s legit insane every democrat isn’t constantly trying to remind people about this
20-1-1-2,"Well, CEO salaries have increased around 1400% since the 70s, so it makes sense they need some tax cuts to help offset all their wealth that's just trickling down like a river sustaining the poor and working class!"
20-1-1-2-1,I think we should start one of those end or world movements where we predict the rapture but instead we predict the date trickle down economics makes us all wealthy
20-1-1-2-2,Sustaining? That sounds like liberal bullshit and I won't have any of it.
20-1-1-3,and they sell cutting social services for the benefit of racists.
20-1-1-4,"2% off a wage earners tax - $122% off a wealthy man's income $120,000"

20-1-3,Thanks. I didn’t even know there was a term for that.
20-1-4,That’s out of the Newt Gingrinch playbook huh
20-1-5,"Before they started with that grift, the US government had so much money off the top tax bracket that we simultaneously went to war in Vietnam and went to the Moon just for fun. Any day now, all that uncollected tax revenue is totally going to start trickling down from the top 1% to the rest of us. Any. Day. Now."
20-1-5-1,"Why we always blaming the top 1%.  I guess because it's easy? Maybe it's because we have no perspective. Here's some perspective.  If your household pulls down $40k a year, congrats, you are in the top 1% of income earners worldwide. So then to 99% of the people in the world you are no different than the ""1%"" we blame.  But all of us reddit warriors still be here crying 1% from our $1000 iPhones... which by the way wouldn't exist in the first place if there were no rich people incentivized to innovate and produce them. Or for that matter the poverty stricken third world labor that we dont mind taking advantage of.  Is the system here perfect, of course not.  Can we make it better,  sure.  But for most of us, we are living better and longer than 99.99 percent of all people who have ever lived.  We the the .01% but nobody would ever never know by all the bitching we do about how horribly unfair it all is."

20-2-1-1,"Don't forget the third part - eagerly taking credit for the good that a law or public program does, even though they voted against it!"
20-2-1-1-2,"I'm honestly surprised they haven't tried to make the vote untraceable for ""anti-corruption"" reasons."

20-2-1-3,"Dem: Hey, we are trying to pass a bill that will give your state more moneyRe: Nope I won't vote for anything the Dems like! I still want more money tho."
20-2-1-4,"This goes all the way down to your average voter. My in-laws are loudly against any kind of stimulus or benefits from the government, yet they always take the money because “well everyone else is.”"
20-2-1-5,This shows what they think about the intelligence of their base.
20-2-1-5-1,They couldn’t give a shit about their base other than the occasional lip service
20-2-2,They will turn down money that helps 'the wrong people' like how Republican states turned down Medicaid expansion in obamacare just to hamstring the program and keep poor people on the ropes
20-2-2-1,Or how they are suing over student loan forgiveness. Can't be helping dem poors out. If they aren't desperate how can I have them work 60 hours with no overtime. Will somebody please think of mistress that needs new pearls and an abortion.
20-2-2-1-1,And what of desperate college students resorting to porn for money?
20-2-2-1-1-1,We have the military for that. Socialism is fine if you're will willing to kill brown people for it. Source: signed up for military to pay for college. Got two tours between oif  and oef and still have 50k in student loan debt.
20-2-2-1-1-1-1,Serious question and forgive my ignorance.  How did you both serve and have to pay for education?    When I was in grad school (yes one anecdote) my vet classmate got “free” tuition in return.   I thought that was the deal.
20-2-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Oh yeah no. I was national guard. So even though I served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and got to enjoy all of the attractions there (07-08). I only got 40 percent of my tuition covered. Sliding scale because it's based off of active duty days. Now, this was the case in 08, only about 40 percent of active duty army personnel had served in the sandboxes. They would qualify for 100 percent tuition coverage even if they hadnt gone over because they were active duty. Yup....gotta love it."
20-2-2-1-2,>Or how they are suing over student loan forgivenessWhile accepting PPP loan forgiveness.
20-2-2-1-2-2,(and let's not forget that Trump directed the destruction of flagged illegal PPP loans)
20-2-2-2,The GOP never turns down money for themselves.
20-2-3,"Politicians, the wealthy, everyone at the top doesn't turn down money when the government offers it. In fact they EXPECT it in the form of tax breaks and bailouts. And then they whine about it if you turn around and ask them to help out themselves, or at the very least pay you back.All while preaching the gospel of self sufficiency."
20-2-3-1,"You mean *Republicans*, right?"
20-2-5,"Or taking credit for never turning down money.The amount of ""I helped lead a team of bipartisan congressmen to help pass this infrastructure bill!"" I've heard the last month and a half is laughable"
20-3,Dark Brandon Move: Executive order stating that federal funds can only be distributed to the various state governors in front of tv cameras in the form of novelty oversized checks a la Publishers Clearinghouse.
20-3-1,"With Biden ""I did that"" signs all around"
20-3-1-1,I’d love that but honestly programs like this should have signs that tell you what’s funding them.A bridge etc built by this should absolutely have signs saying hey funded by the inflation reduction act.Bills should brag to the population what they did. I dunno about having a politicians name but the bill name for sure.
20-3-1-1-1,A lot of transportation things in California actually do have signs that tell you what funded it. I love it and wish everything did too.
20-3-1-1-1-2,"Same in Colorado. Anytime there is road construction, there are signs that say ""Your tax dollars at work! Funded by X Bill."""
20-3-1-1-1-4,Seriously. It's kinda cool to be  able to drive around and pretty much every public works project going on has a giant freaking sign out in front of it showing what funded it and fuck loads of other information. They usually have a rendering of what the project will eventually look like too.
20-3-1-1-2,"Like the New Deal did in the 30s? We had lots is bridges and parks and other infrastructure projects all over the US with placards saying that it was built by the Works Progress Administration or Civilian Conservation Corps. I don't think many of those projects are left, but I remember seeing those all over in small towns in the 80s."
20-3-1-1-2-1,There's sidewalks all over the town I used to live in that have WPA stamped into them
20-3-1-1-2-1-1,"Used to work in Riverside, California and they are everywhere!"
20-3-1-1-2-2,So many great spring fed swimming pools from the CCC/WPA are still heavily used in Austin Texas. The city’s crowned jewels
20-3-1-1-2-3,"The town I used to live in, in central WI, had a bunch of parks courtesy of the WPA, and all the buildings, bridges, lined creeks, and roads are all still there and in use."
20-3-1-2,"I mean, Trump literally tried to do that with the stimulus checks by ""signing"" them. When he was told he legally couldn't do that, he sent a letter to every single person explaining its his check to you, and putting his name in the memo line.Dark Brandon is all about calling out bullshit, not being vindictive or tactless."
20-3-1-2-1,"Nah, I want him to force them to take the check on camera with a laugh track from Scoobie Doo playing in the background"
20-3-1-2-2,"The two major differences are that 1, TFG had nothing to do with those checks but was trying to take all the credit, and 2, was exactly the 'socialist BS' him and the GOP rail against on a daily basis(but now it's OK because our guy is taking credit for it)."
20-3-1-3,Trump had his signature placed on US Treasury Covid stimulus checks
20-3-1-3-1,"His supporters probably believe he was giving his own money, not using a government handout."
20-3-2,"Honestly since they voted against the funding, they shouldn’t be asking for it.  What, like they could pass legislation to help their constituents?  That’s crazy talk"
20-3-3,He should sign an executive that Denies any States from receiving funds for things they voting against funding for.
20-3-3-1,Or at least make them dance for it
20-3-3-2,Fuck that. Lots of people who voted against the GOP live in those states.
20-3-3-2-1,That's how democracy works. They will learn to vote in their interests and Republican politicians will as well.
20-3-3-4,"Horrible, horrible idea. Many people in those states vote as blue as you do. They don’t deserve that. Not that the red voters really do either."
20-3-3-4-1,"Democracy is like that, always. If the law is that way, they'll figure it out. The Republicans will learn how to watch out for themselves."
20-3-4,That feels more like a Trump move.
20-3-5,"Kinda like how trump held up relief checks so they could go out with his signature on them.  It sounds funny but republicans would absolutely turn down the money to deny him the publicity and then blame him when their states turn to shit, well shittier."
20-4,Red states are overwhelming the ones that rely on government subsidy and welfareBut they absolutely hate socialism y'all!
20-4-1,"Careful, Republicans will accuse you of bEiNg DiViSiVe.*(please don't remember that Republicans were openly laughing at people dying in blue states and cities at the height of the pandemic)*"
20-4-1-1,"Yeah well, they can all eat my fuck."
20-4-1-3,I'm so glad you brought that back up for the sole fact that people definitely forgot that happened
20-4-1-5,"I'll never understand (just kidding it's hypocrisy they don't care) how they could go from Trump, who couldn't say ""Left"" without putting ""*Radical*"" in front of it, and say ""Wow Dems are SUPER divisive!"""
20-4-1-5-1,Cognitive Dissonance
20-4-2,This is true for red cities and counties too.  The areas of a state that produce a surplus trend overwhelmingly blue.  Red cities and counties typically rely on welfare to stay afloat.
20-4-2-1,"Illinois in a nutshell.Huge state (12th biggest) and has nearly 13 million people, however 9.5 million live within about 2 hours of Chicago. Cook County, where Chicago is located, has 5 million all by itself.  Despite this, drive 3 hours south or west and you'll see stickers on cars about how Chicago is draining the coffers of Illinois and that Cook should be severed from Illinois.Illinois is a beautiful, marvelous state that mostly is full of corn but southern residents of it feel that the only revenue generating part of it *is* the problem."
20-4-2-1-2,"Fargo, North Dakota has about 16% of the state's population (much more when you count its metropolitan area that extends into Minnesota), and it trends more blue than the rest of the state. Recently rural rhetoric about the city has started to describe it as a dystopia hell-scape plagued by crime and violence, despite the fact that it is statistically very safe with an extremely low unemployment rate and good access to affordable housing. They especially hate that a black woman was elected to the city council and voted in favor of no longer requiring the pledge of allegiance in schools. It also implemented ranked-choice voting after previous elections, so I'm sure as soon as rural people here figure that out and tie it together with Alaska's recent Republican upset due to the same system they will get angry at that."
20-4-2-1-2-2,They are saying what republicans in Oregon are saying about Portland. They act like Portland has been burnt to the ground. The city is fine and recovering from the COVID shutdown.
20-4-2-1-3,A study was commissioned by a state rep in 2010 that showed Seattle only got to spend around 60% of the tax revenue it generated in Seattle.
20-4-2-1-3-1,"This is the same for every big city, and there's plenty of studies that prove it. These people just aren't really one to study anything."
20-4-2-1-4,"I love when rural people think cities need them because they grow produce... Like if they seceded or formed a different state, goods suddenly couldn't be sold across state boundaries"
20-4-2-1-4-1,"> I love when rural people think cities need them because they grow produce...You're being very logical & generous here. They literally think that the taxes from rural folks are paying for the infrastructure and welfare programs in the big cities. Like, the complete opposite of what actually happens, which anyone who's taken an economics course would know."
20-4-2-1-4-1-1,"No need for economic course to understand basic stuff.If you are a normal homo sapiens.Not sapiens sapiens, i mean single sapiens."
20-4-2-1-4-1-3,And all the facts and evidence to the contrary can be ignored as liberal lies while there is no evidence of their view except some meme posted on facebook that supports their feelings.
20-4-2-1-4-2,And the loudest ones are always the ones barely keeping themselves alive by selling government subsidized corn back to the government to make ethanol that the government then forces private businesses to buy. Leeches without the skills to make an honest living any other way.
20-4-2-1-4-3,Like their fucking corn really even feeds people. Not particularly.
21,Biden calls 'emergency' meeting after missile hits Poland
21-1,I think the internet has ruined the words “emergency meeting” for me.
21-1-2,Putin sus haahahaha
21-1-4,Biden vented?
21-1-5,Russia Sus
21-1-5-1,Sussia
21-2,Well if nuclear war starts at least I don’t have to go to workEdit: still going to work today.
21-2-1,I still have my doubts
21-2-1-1,Yeah we're actually gonna need you to come in an hour earlier.
21-2-1-1-1,"And stay an hour later, too, because the holidays are coming up!"
21-3,is this a real accident or russia testing nato? my 8 ball is unclear
21-3-1,"98% an accident, but the response will be critical. Otherwise a missile will hit downtown Lublin or a supply depot in Rzeszów and Russia will be like “oops sowwy ” all over again.EDIT: I am aware this was likely a Ukrainian S300 which failed to intercept a Russian target. The loss of life remains as tragic as any other in this war, though it is Ukraine’s right to defend its territory.I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have."
21-3-1-1,"They are not even sorry now - in fact, they 100% claim they have nothing to do with it, which, already now, is proven to be a lieEdit: so since people are denser than I expected, I apparently need to elaborate my comment - being involved does NOT mean they NECESSARILY fired the rocket. Poland pretty quickly figured out the missile is Russian-made, which DOES automatically involve themEdit 2: Furthermore, if Russia hadnt invaded and rained missiles upon Ukraine, the Ukrainians wouldnt have had to defend themselves with their own missilesSo yes, Russia is directly and indirectly involved with the two civilians that was killed in Poland"
21-3-1-1-1,Russia really really really wants to get in to a war with NATO?
21-3-1-1-1-1,"The opposite, if NATO enters the war they can't possibly win. Even just the US military getting directly involved will ruin them, it would be old military hardware and a handful of the advanced stuff they don't want to risk against Ukraine vs. literally the best military equipment trillions of dollars can buy"
21-3-1-1-1-1-1,Well plus also all those super well-trained Russian conscripts.
21-3-1-1-1-1-2,NATO entering could give him enough justification in his mind to fire off the nukes and call humanity a wrap. That's a plausible end game for someone who was a feared leader of a superpower until recently.
21-3-1-1-1-2,"Russia losing against Ukraine would be pathetic, losing against NATO is reasonable and less embarrassing."
21-3-1-1-1-2-1,"But far more inevitable - if NATO are involved in a hot war, it's only a question of whether everyone loses or just Russia. There's no path to victory for Russia - just the option of taking everyone down with them with what remains of their serviceable nuclear arsenal."
21-3-1-1-3,Biden just said it’s unlikely that it was fired from Russia but needs further investigation.Everyone calm your jets
21-3-1-1-3-1,"Those words were chosen deliberately. FROM Russia, not by Russia. Fired from Ukraine by Russia still makes Biden's statement true."
21-3-1-1-3-1-1,This is something that irks me on Reddit. Newsspeak is very deliberate and political yet people take it all so literally and completely ignore the grammatical nuance of statements by figureheads
21-3-1-1-3-1-1-1,I'm just glad we currently have someone capable of being such a leader.
21-3-1-1-3-4,Source? Just want to be sure in these hectic times
21-3-1-2,"Na. You don’t fly a missile 1,000km from its point of launch, and watch it fly into neutral territory and kill farmers. At a grain silo.And then do it with a second missile. That’s not an accident."
21-3-1-2-1,"The videos of missiles hitting today also showed pairs going after the same targets in Ukraine.Either Russia had an ""accident"" or some soldier put in bad coordinates and has now been reassigned to a window posting.  With the amount of stuff monitoring the war on the NATO border there is no way Poland doesn't know where the missiles came from."
21-3-1-2-1-1,"""window posting""oh that sounds nice...wait a second"
21-3-1-2-1-1-1,Why am I falling???!
21-3-1-2-1-1-1-1,window view and fresh air?sounds like a winner!
21-3-1-2-1-2,"With Russian preparedness and cohesion during the recent invasion (particularly lack thereof), there is almost nothing that can’t be ruled as an accident or incompetence"
21-3-1-2-1-3,"lmao""Wait, longitude goes first or latitude?""""Fuck if I know, I got recruited like three weeks ago too!"""
21-3-3,"100% it has to be an accident. Putin knows if he triggers a NATO response, short of using his entire nuclear arsenal, he is fucked"
21-3-3-3,"I lack a ton of context in this particular case, but how on earth can you launch missiles by accident in this day and age?"
21-3-3-3-2,Because it’s Russian-made
21-3-3-3-2-1,"R/NCD has a post which shows that the missile operator likely put in the longitude for Lviv Railway Yard, but put in the latitude for Kyiv.Thus, WWIII could be sparked because someone copied the wrong cell from a Microsoft excel spreadsheet into a missile guidance system."
21-4,"Realistically this meeting probably consists of ""Poland will invoke Article 4. What are we going to say at this meeting?"""
21-4-1,I do not like how accustomed I’m becoming to the articles
21-4-1-1,Welcome to my childhood. The Cold War sucked.
21-4-1-1-1,"I believe it. In hindsight it's fascinating how tense everything was.Now that monstrous levels of tension are the current zeitgeist, I hate it.Give me boring times any day."
21-4-1-1-1-1,"There's a reason the phrase ""may you live in interesting times"" was not intended as positive."
21-4-1-1-1-1-1,Yep.Stephen King novels are extremely interesting but Id take a pass on being *in* one.
21-4-1-1-1-2,"My daughter, who recently turned 18, asked me about growing up then and how we did it. My answer of ""we just did"" wasn't well received. I couldn't get her to understand that we just put it out of our heads because there was nothing we could do about it. Dwelling on it only scared the crap out of you, it didn't actually accomplish anything. The difference in generations I suppose. I can't remember a time when the news wasn't saber rattling about nukes, she went her entire childhood free from that."
21-4-1-1-1-2-3,Yeah. But she got climate change. With humanity ending up died out in the end so… to each their own horror. 
21-4-1-1-2,"cold war had people building bunkersthis new cold war people are like idgaf anymore nuke me, please"
21-4-1-1-2-2,I kinda want a well-stocked underground rec room now. Can I still get someone to build me a fallout shelter?
21-4-1-1-2-2-1,If you’re rich there’s a whole market for this
21-4-1-1-3,"Yeah I am just old enough to have missed the first go round, but my mother has told me many stories and it was horrifying."
21-4-1-1-3-1,"My saddest one is, our mother was constantly irked by my older sister dragging her feet about going to school. Years later, my sister told me she was scared to go to school because there might be a surprise bomb drill, or maybe a real bomb. An 8-year-old girl lived in fear every day."
21-4-1-1-3-1-1,"Nowdays she wouldn't have to worry about bombs, just guns and active shooter drills.So glad I grew up in the golden years between the Berlin wall coming down and columbine going off"
21-4-1-1-3-1-1-1,"I grew up during the same time but on military bases. I distinctly remember the first time we did an “invasion drill”. 1993, third grade, on the playground, sirens go off and everyone run to the building and hide under the window so the shooter can’t see you. The school officials walked the campus checking to make sure we locked doors and were hidden properly. It was unnerving but as a military kid, you get used to some weird stuff like moving every few years, your parent being gone for months at a time, and having your car searched by armed guards every-time you came back on base.I can’t believe we’re at a point where that’s a “normal” drill now."
21-4-1-1-5,"Honestly, I felt safer during the Cold War because as terrible as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is as a doctrine, I didn't actually think that either the US or Soviets would actually let things reach that point. Now, on the other hand, I have vastly less confidence in Russia's stability and that Putin won't try something out of ego/desperation.And, purely on a personal note, I live far enough away from a primary target that I'll probably survive an initial attack.(I do still live within 20 miles of three to four primary targets, but definitely not as good as when I when I worked in a primary target.)"
21-4-1-3,What is article 4? I’m not familiar and would appreciate an explanation or even just a link?
21-4-1-5,Should I be concerned that we're having near apocalyptic situations every 6 months now?
21-4-2,"My guess? ATACMS for ukraine, deployment of an Air Defense Battalion to Polish/ukranian boarder to shoot anything in range (including anything it can reach on the ukranian side of the boarder), tanks to the ukranians and maybe aircraft"
21-4-2-1,"I tend to see this position as most plausible. NATO will up their readiness and logistics. Serves as justification to expedite air defense and troop movement. Considering we’re almost a full year into this war, I really believe NATO has prepped for a scenario just like this one.Obviously the escalation and the two farmers killed ups the intensity, but I don’t think it’s quite the time to push the panic button on making this a global war. If Poland and NATO logistically set themselves up, I think that’s a massive deterrent. If Putin was really trying to force NATOs hand to engage, I think there would be a more forceful blow."
21-4-2-1-1,"> If Putin was really trying to force NATOs hand to engage, I think there would be a more forceful blow.The distinct impression I've had for a while is that Russia is trying to avoid further NATO involvement. Sure, their in-house propaganda says that NATO is fighting a proxy war with Ukraine but they probably know that they'd be in even worse shape if they drew NATO into the war.Their goal is to make Ukraine part of Russia, bringing NATO into the war would be counterproductive to say the least."
21-4-2-1-1-1,"If they really wanted to avoid any escalation, they wouldn't have been flying their poor-piss-can't-aim-for-shit missiles anywhere near NATO's borders.This may have been an accident, but one that tests NATO's response."
21-4-2-1-1-2,"I think so too. I have to imagine this was probably a mistake. Russia hasn't shown great capabilities to this point, and the US has also been guilty of missing on some strikes. Easy to believe a couple went off their intended course."
21-4-2-1-1-2-1,"Its most likely a mistake.However, if I accidentally shoot somebody, Im still going to jail for manslaughter."
21-4-2-1-1-2-1-1,"Unfortunately for the world, there's no easy way to put Putin in jail right now."
21-4-2-1-1-3,"Yeah this is what I don’t get. I see so many people commenting that this was an intentional strike by Russia in order to get NATO involved. While this could be the case, why in the world would Russia want that? By most accounts Russia is at best struggling and at worst losing in there war with Ukraine. Why would they want to bring the brunt of NATO into the mix?"
21-4-2-1-1-3-1,"There's an argument to be made that it gives them an out domestically. ""We were winning but now NATO is there, and we don't care enough about Ukraine to fight NATO.""I don't necessarily believe this reasoning, but it's out there and I've seen others claim to believe its true."
21-4-2-1-1-3-1-1,"This is the argument I am making.  It doesn't make sense for ""Russia"" as some abstract entity.  It absolutely makes sense for Putin.  He is losing a war to what his public considers a vastly inferior enemy.  Loosing to Ukraine would be a death sentence for him.  Provoking NATO exactly enough to get it to openly destroy some russian things/kill some people (preferably as few and as soon as possible) and they can blair on for years about having held the line for months against the combined might of the West single handedly and that they only withdrew from the ""temporarily occupied territories"" as a good will gesture to save the world from nuclear Armageddon.   And that they will win the next round once the T-14s and SU-57s are available in numbers.  Putin needs the image of F-35s bombing the Russian army to survive at this point."
21-4-2-1-2,"People are rightly freaked out about nuclear war, but there are a LOT of things that have to go wrong first before we start launching ICBMs.The death of two Polish citizens at the hands of Russian incompetence/carelessness will see a proportional response."
21-4-2-1-2-1,The Russians took down a whole plane of civilians and nobody did shit
21-4-2-1-2-1-2,That was before we knew how useless the Russian army is.
21-4-2-1-2-1-3,"Shit, the Soviets shot down a commercial airliner in the 80s that contained a SITTING US CONGRESSMAN and it didn't lead to all out war. There is an extremely strong desire not to get into a humanity-ending war."
21-4-2-1-2-3,"They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?"
21-4-2-1-2-4,"We gotta kill two Russian citizens clearly(I’m joking, killing citizens is a war crime, and is wrong)"
21-4-2-1-2-4-3,Long live the Code of Hammurabi
21-4-2-1-4,"Perhaps Putin doesn’t want to “force NATOs hand” but just wants to desensitize their responsiveness.Ninja edit: Since tone is difficult through Reddit, I’ll just say I’m agreeing with you and thinking out loud."
21-4-2-2,American tanks and aircraft are unlikely. What I would like to see is a relaxation of the American position that Ukraine can't use weapons provided by the US to strike inside Russian territory.
21-4-2-2-4,We all would but the potential escalation could be bad.
21-4-2-2-4-1,"We need to stop operating under the assumption that the Russian response to NATO escalation is worse than the NATO response to Russian escalation. We need to shift this mindset of ""NATO shouldn't respond; imagine Russia's reaction!"" to ""Russia shouldn't respond; imagine NATO's reaction!""If another Russian missile hits NATO territory and kills people, NATO should respond with a missile strike or two on Russian forces in Ukraine."
21-4-2-2-4-1-1,"This. Russia has far more to fear from NATO than NATO has to fear from Russia. Even if Russia went nuclear, NATO could still beat them using conventional weapons. So much has changed since the end of the Cold War."
21-4-2-2-4-1-1-5,"I t's easy to say, sitting on the other continent across the ocean and watching wars on TV."
21-4-2-2-4-1-5,That's a bit of a gamble that you're dealing with a rational actor (who has fucking nukes) isn't it? Paranoid aging dictators (that look puffy and like absolute shit) aren't known for their restraint...
21-4-2-2-4-1-5-1,"Putin is on thin ice in Russia. Many people aren't happy with how things are going. If he actually ordered nukes, he might fall out of a window."
21-4-2-2-5,"Id prefer to leave the war at the existing claims.Claims are Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zapoizhizhia, Kherson and Crimea currently.Attacks within Russia have already happened but must be kept to a minimum.Ukraine gaining better and better weaponry though hastens this, saves lives.  Heck even saves russian lives in the long run if this ends quickly."
21-4-3,What does article 4 mean?
21-4-3-1,"Article 4> The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.Article 5> The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.TL;DR: Article 4 says you can call a full meeting when threatened.  Article 5 says everyone has to help as they deem necessary."
21-4-3-1-1,"Article 6We go a-ridin' into town, a whampin' and whompin' every livin' thing that moves within an inch of its life. Except the women folks, of course."
21-4-3-1-1-2,You spare the women?
21-4-3-1-1-2-2,"Not just the women, but the children too!"
21-4-3-1-1-2-3,"""Yeah, and we respect the hell outta them!"""
21-4-3-1-1-3,Article 7*Candy-gram for Mongo!*
21-4-3-2,NATO opens a group chat.
21-4-3-3,"> **What is NATO Article 4?**> The article allows NATO members to bring any issue of concern, especially regarding security, for discussion at the North Atlantic Council. Article 4 does not mean there will be direct pressure to act.> Under Article 4, any member state can convene a meeting of NATO members to ""consult"" when it feels its independence or security is threatened. In practice, it has rarely been used; regardless, it sends a strong message to the greater world that NATO is concerned about the situation.I think the other guy who responded to you is confused and thinking about Article 5 which is also explained in that article. That's the one that you see a lot of people mentioning today which basically says if you attack one NATO country, then you've attacked all NATO countries."
21-4-3-3-1,"Nah, 4 seems right. Poland isn't dumb and isn't going to escalate without a direct and intentional attack. Invoking 4 tells Russia to fuck off and gives the rest of the alliance good reason to have assets in Poland."
21-4-3-4,Think of it like a soft article 5. It brings NATO together to discuss an issue but doesn't necessarily end in them calling for overt action.
21-4-5,"There are a lot of non-violent options, such as:1. Designating Russia as a state sponsor of terror2. Confiscate Russia’s foreign assets and give the money to Ukraine3. More sanctions"
21-4-5-3,None of those things actually matter to Russia though
21-4-5-3-1,"Oh you better believe they would matter to Russia.The state sponsor of terrorism would have wide ranging implications for Russia. It would forbid any US citizen from doing any financial transactions with Russia. It would also subject Russian nationals to a high degree of scrutiny in financial transactions abroad.Secondly, it would increase the pressure to add Russia to the blacklist for the financial action task force, which would put it on the list along with North Korea and Iran.Russia would also lose sovereign immunity, meaning US citizens could sue Russia for damages to any terrorist activity.Either of these actions would put Russia in the same class of countries as Iran and North Korea—effectively pariahs on the world stage."
21-4-5-3-1-2,Serious question: How much worse is that than what we're already doing? I feel like we are already sanctioning Russia and confiscating their assets quite a bit. How much more can we actually do?
21-4-5-3-1-2-1,"From my knowledge Russia’s assets are *frozen*, not confiscated. They are still owned by the Russian state, but they currently are blocked from accessing them. Yachts and other minor stuff was confiscated from Russian *oligarchs*, not the State itselfConfiscating those assets would incur actual and significant loss to Russia, but it would also cause damage to the financial institutions which hold those assets to any non-western-aligned or even any weary country (if you’re like Saudi Arabia or dunno, Brunei, you wouldn’t trust those institutions with your assets anymore as they could confiscate them if the west turns on you)"
21-4-5-3-1-2-2,Quite a bit more actually.Think of how isolated North Korea is. That is basically the end of the road.
21-4-5-3-1-2-2-2,"Except China and India will still trade with Russia, and that's all Russia cares about. That's why Russia doesn't care about the current sanctions."
21-4-5-3-1-2-3,"He somehow glossed over the most substantial aspect of being designated a state sponsor of terrorism:  It automatically forces a complete cessation of trade with anyone who trades with Russia.So China, India and everyone else in the world would be forced to choose:  continue trade, aid, etc with US or with Russia?  You only get to keep relations with one.  Choose wisely."
21-4-5-3-1-2-3-1,"And if China just goes on trading with Russia, what would the US do? Stop trading with China isn't an option, it's it?"
21-4-5-4,If only the CIA could just assassinate Putin already.
21-4-5-5,Establishing no fly zones
21-4-5-5-2,No fly zones would only happen under article 5.Effectively means we’re at war with Russia.
21-4-5-5-3,That's a violent option.
21-5,baffling how a Russian missile operator can mistake a polish tractor for a Malaysian airliner
21-5-2,"As a Malaysian, I feel sad... (MH17)"
21-5-2-1,"I feel sad that teams from Holland and Malaysia worked very hard and investigated and confirmed it was Russia that shot down this plane and Russian just said 'nope, can't prove it'."
21-5-2-1-2,First time?
21-5-2-3,"As a Dutchie, MH17 makes me feel angry."
21-5-2-3-1,May I as a dutchie  throw my klompen at putin?
21-5-2-3-1-1,I'll allow it.
21-5-2-3-1-1-1,I'll encourage it
21-5-5,Damn shots fired
22,Supreme Court rejects request to block Biden student debt forgiveness program
22-1,The larger Nebraska case was just dismissed too:[
22-1-1,Holy shit. This just made my night. Should be way higher.
22-1-1-1,"Yes, you should be way higher tonight."
22-1-1-1-1,High High Captain!
22-1-2,As a Nebraskan who is excitedly waiting for $20k in forgiveness to be applied. Thank goodness. Why all the people of Nebraska continue to vote for the face eating party I'll never know. Can't wait to move away.
22-1-2-1,"That's part of the reason. Brain drain. People don't see the situation improving and they leave. I'm not pointing fingers, I don't live in Montana anymore....."
22-1-2-1-1,Yep. Don’t have to worry about student loans or student loan forgiveness if you’re not into that “book lernin’ “
22-1-2-1-1-1,Shit winds a’blowin’
22-1-4,is this the big one that a judge was hearing two or so weeks ago?
22-1-4-1,"It's the big one that everyone thought had the best chance of blocking the forgiveness.It seems pretty unlikely that any of the remaining cases will be able to block forgiveness prior to the 10/23 deadline which is the earliest that they are allowed to forgive any debt, which means we could see forgiveness coming pretty soon.We should probably see if anything crazy goes down tomorrow though. But it is looking pretty good as of now, at least in terms of being able to get the ball rolling on some forgiveness which should make the prospect of blocking forgiveness more difficult."
22-2,">Justice Amy Coney Barrett denied the emergency application to block the program, which had been filed by a Wisconsin taxpayers’ group on Wednesday.I remember when I moved here and thought it was a progressive state."
22-2-1,I love Wisconsin but politically you guys are so weird.  For every Proxmire or Feingold there's a McCarthy or Johnson.
22-2-1-1,It's because Charles Koch actively uses Wisconsin as a testing ground for his attempts to manipulate politics with money.
22-2-1-1-1,Don't forget we're also the most gerrymandered state at the state level.  GOP got 47% of the vote and got a super majority in the state assembly.Fuck ron Johnson.
22-2-1-1-1-1,These things are directly related. Wisconsin is so gerrymandered because of Charles Koch's machinations.
22-2-1-1-1-1-2,"Oh absolutely, I was more trying to add on to what the Kochs have done to the state.   Outside of Madison and Milwaukee it's no different than rural Mississippi.  Wis-issippi if you will."
22-2-1-1-1-1-2-2,Man the kochs are like the same level of old scum as Murdoch.how do these guys live so long
22-2-1-1-2,Don’t forget Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein.Far-right mega donors from Wisconsin.
22-2-1-1-2-3,"Yep, they work directly with Koch. He's the ringmaster."
22-2-1-1-2-4,And Diane Hendricks.
22-2-2,"It used to be a lot better, but it fucking sucks now."
22-2-2-1,"When the Koch Brothers decided to turn our state into their AFP testing ground, everything went down hill, FAST"
22-2-2-1-1,"Wisconsin's gerrymandering is some of the worst in the country.   Because they gave Republican's full control for a while.If you vote Republican enough, your vote won't ever matter again."
22-2-2-1-1-1,Happened in NC too.
22-2-2-2,"Yea, I just finished my second decade in Milwaukee and it has declined rapidly since Scott Walker (no surprise)"
22-2-2-2-1,"I grew up in Wisconsin. So depressing to see fucking Minnesota embrace liberal ideals and become a much better run state. Given the similar backgrounds Wisconsin, that could have easily been their path as well.Also find it so weird my current home state of Virginia is more fucking liberal. The former capital of the confederacy."
22-2-2-2-1-1,Minnesota is what Wisconsin used to be
22-2-2-2-1-1-2,"Nah, they haven't elected a member of the Socialist Party yet."
22-2-2-2-1-2,"There's a Milwaukee county referendum on legalizing weed.  I'm honestly shocked, my bet is Wisconsin would be last or 2nd last behind Iowa for legal marijuana"
22-2-2-3,"Imo it’s like that with about all red or Midwest states. I used to feel decent in Indiana, but trump has empowered idiots and bigots and those people have dug their heels in the ground. I used to feel like there was hope and opportunity, but that has dwindled significantly."
22-2-2-3-1,It's insane to think this state went blue in 2008. I can't imagine it ever happening again.
22-2-2-3-1-1,Same with Ohio.
22-2-2-3-1-1-1,"Yeah. It's wild that we were such a purple, competitive state that Ohio's vote in the general was in line with the electoral college for decades until 2020. 2016 was the real paradigm shift, but Trump won the vote that year so it wasn't noticeable just yet. I can't stand this state anymore. I guess there's been a lot of this shit for a long time actually, but Trump pulled all the idiots out of the woodwork. I'm glad to be in the heart of a major city, but I'd rather just be somewhere else entirely."
22-2-2-3-1-1-1-1,It's because Ohio is gerrymandered to fuck. The states house and Senate have a GOP supermajority.
22-2-3,"30 years ago WI was politically similar to MN. But MN decided to keep taxes high and funnel the money into education and services so that people actually want to live here, and WI slashed taxes, services, and busted unions to “attract businesses.”Now all the high paying jobs are in MN because that’s where the educated workforce is and the manufacturing jobs are leaving WI for the new cheapest place."
22-2-3-2,"This doesn't sound correct to me based on our property taxes and what I have seen at least, but I am not well versed in the history of either state beyond the fact that Wisconsin (well, Milwaukee) has elected socialists and also Joe McCarthy in a fucked-up twist. I assumed I was coming to a place where progressives like Herb Kohl were doing good for everyone, but a few election cycles later and we had fuckface for governor who beat a recall and shit all over while raking money for his friends and stacking the courts/redrawing districts. And since then sad trombone. But for a few shitheads winning narrow elections goes MN as I see it but would love more info"
22-2-4,"It is, but it’s been gerrymandered to hell"
22-2-4-3,"idk, looks like pretty purple to me.A govenors race that flip-flops, senate seats that flip-flop. Close presidential races within 1%.The house seats are gerrymandered, but you're not gerrymandering the gubernatorial races, and those look _solidly_ purple imo."
22-2-4-3-1,"Wisconsin has the same problem all the purple states have now: the cities are mostly liberal, and the rural areas are Trumpland. Election results depend on which of those groups show up. High turnout in Madison and Milwaukee in 2018 is what gave Evers his win."
22-2-4-3-1-1,"> the cities are mostly liberal, and the rural areas are Trumpland.Blue states are the same, even CA and NY. I think there's just a lot more people in the cities."
22-2-4-3-1-1-1,"Yeah, funny fact, California was the state with the most Trump voters."
22-2-4-3-1-2,"I mean, I agree.Parent comment said they thought it was a progressive state, reply said it was gerrymandered.  I responded saying it looked solidly purple.I live in a major city center of a very purple state. I very much understand purple state politics. I don't pretend to think my state is progressive when the statehouse is gerrymandered to fuck and we're often split on senators.I was just stating that it being gerrymandered didn't effect the gubernatorial races which were _also_ purple, and countered the ""progressive state"" comment as well."
22-2-4-3-1-2-1,"We're solidly purple as far as state-wide elections are concerned. However, we are so gerrymandered that there's basically no chance Democrats will control either branch of the state legislature. That means that the governorship is close to a coin flip each election, but congress is always Republican.D governor means we can temper the R congress's worst ideas, and R governor means we get four+ years of unfettered R policies. There's basically no way our state can enact (relatively) progressive D policies, so things are never going to get better. In that sense, Wisconsin is sadly not purple at all."
22-2-4-3-1-2-1-1,"Exactly this. And as we get more unfettered R policies under an R gov, the likelihood of electing another D gov goes down.  So it will get worse and worse over time.Only hope is in the courts at this point."
22-2-5,Can I ask the Supreme Court to block the tax breaks for the rich?
22-2-5-1,"Naw, it would hurt the people they get money from.Also, is your username a Ren and Stimpy reference? I am rolling it over in my head and can only hear Ren saying ""steeenky weeezilteets"""
22-2-5-1-1,I’ll teach you grand mother to suck eggs!!! Yes Ren & Stimpy reference from the happy happy joy joy song. Cheers!DONT WHIZ ON THE ELECTRIC FENCE
22-3,Good
22-3-1,"It is good, but this doesn't mean the battle is over or anywhere near it.This is an emergency request from a pretty weak plaintiff that had poor chances to begin with - a taxpayers' group out of Wisconsin.There is still a mountain of litigation to come and loan forgiveness is not entirely safe from the courts. The real tests will be lawsuits from states, Congress, and loan servicers.It's a tall order for someone to find standing, but it's a numbers game within a very questionable judiciary, and we're not out of the woods yet."
22-3-1-1,That's why I urge everyone that's eligible to apply for the forgiveness ASAP. It's my understanding that they will do it in order of submission - and it will be harder to claw that money back after it's forgiven than it will be to just stop accepting new applications. IMO.E: this is pretty late but for everyone wanting to know how to apply: 
22-3-1-1-1,"It’s not only hard, but I believe it is literally impossible. Once a loan is discharged, there is no mechanism in place to undo it. You can’t just say, “sorry, just kidding…you all this forgiven debt again.”"
22-3-1-1-1-1,Yeah...they can't send Fat Tony and crew to pick up the payment..
22-3-1-1-1-1-1,What does Johnny Tightlips have to say on the matter?
22-3-1-1-1-1-2,"I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my Republicans, have been most vocal on the subject of the student loan monies. ""Where's the money? ""When are you going to get the money?"" ""Why aren't you getting the money now?"" And so on. So please - the money."
22-3-1-1-1-2,There is nothing that says they can't but it would be political suicide so it is as safe as it can get I guess.
22-3-1-1-1-2-1,I think you’d have riots in the streets if you try to retroactively force debt on people once it’s already been forgiven. Can you imagine giving *millions* of people $10-$20K (really more when you factor in interest payments) and then telling them to go fuck themselves?
22-3-1-1-2,I got mine in during the beta phase and like a minute after it went up
22-3-1-1-2-1,Same here beta buddy.Fingers crossed it actually goes through.
22-3-1-1-3,How do I apply?
22-3-1-1-3-1,Here: 
22-3-1-2,Every single argument will be that less debt means businesses make less money.In essence the argument will be that the government doesn’t have a right to free people from their indentured servitude.One of the legal standing arguments was along these lines. “We can’t find workers as easily for the wages we are offering if they don’t have as great of a need to pay off their debt”
22-3-1-2-4,I just don't get how that's a legal argument. I'd be open to someone explaining it to me.Businesses can literally say the government can't do things because they're legally entitled to profit?
22-3-1-2-5,"No, if the Republicans win the House, the House has standing to sue the president for usurping the power of the purse. Probably the strongest argument."
22-3-1-2-5-1,"Except Congress passed a law allowing the President to discharge loans due to an emergency. This means they already had their say in the matter. If they didn't like the law, should have repealed it."
22-3-1-2-5-1-1,"Yeah I mean, look I am happy everyone is getting their loans cancelled.But the law your talking about was passed in 2003 giving the president emergency powers, intending to cancel student loans of 9/11 first responders and military personnel, applied to COVID-19 in 2021 to broadly cancel loans that have to do neither. It’s a cute trick at best, and it will only survive if nobody has standing.However, Biden is intending to cancel loans before December 31st, so people who apply before November 15 might see their loans cancelled before republican house can sue.I am not sure Republican house would sue, it would be pretty unpopular."
22-3-2,Picking their battles real fucking careful these days.
22-3-2-1,"Yeah, they're just trying to avoid enraging voters so close to the midterms.In a weird way, it might have been better in the long run if they'd blocked it."
22-3-2-2,\^\^\^ THISThis is EXACTLY what this is.
22-3-2-2-1,They won’t do another roe v wade until it’s “the last one”.
22-3-2-2-1-1,Or until November 9th.
22-4,I just woohed Amy Barrett. I need a drink.
22-4-1,"To be honest, Their lack of standing and wanting to sue the government over the government use of tax dollars was so ridiculous that even Barrett couldn’t let that go. Could you imagine if everyone could sue if they didn’t like how taxes were being used."
22-4-1-1,"I think also as much as the loan relief is helping Dems right now, killing it would hurt GOP midterms more than help. Cause then you've just given Dems full license to say 'see, both sides aren't the same. We gave it to you, and because we don't have the seats in congress, they took it away'."
22-4-1-1-1,"This is why Joe Biden waited until right before the midterms to do it. It was a smart move, and he doesn't get enough credit for it."
22-4-1-1-1-1,"I’ve been saying this was the plan the whole time, the administration would save it for right before the midterms as a way to motivate the base"
22-4-1-1-1-2,"Smart, depressing, but smart"
22-4-3,Gotta throw the plebs a bone every now and then.
22-4-3-1,"more like when you’re gearing up to establish permanent GOP executive control, don’t make decisions that weaken the executive.  Once they’ve secured it, they will make it a king basically."
22-5,Watch theyll be asked agian after midterms then decide to take it.
22-5-1,It will be too late.  They (the feds) can begin taking action this weekend.Well this comment didn't age well.... now it's paused..
22-5-1-1,"Yea, I got an email from DOE that said that I meet the requirements and that on Nov 14, $10,000 will be forgiven.Edit: A screenshot of the email. "
22-5-1-1-1,"I also was able to submit a letter for a private school I worked at for over 3 years to get another $20K forgiven considering the district I worked at 10 years ago. So, yeah, I'm hoping all goes through, just half relief would put me on a clean course for the next decade until my kids are out of school."
22-5-1-1-1-1,I thought it only applies to federal student loans. Please tell me I'm incorrect.
22-5-1-1-2,I filled mine out during the Beta on Sunday and haven’t received an email yet. I have about $55k left with multiple Pell grants.
22-5-1-1-2-1,I did as well. Just hours after the beta email went out. I got another email today for regular application and I’m wondering if I should do it again just to be sure. I’m very worried of something messing up lol
22-5-1-1-2-1-1,Im pretty sure it said specifically on the beta that you shouldn’t apply again afterwards
22-5-1-1-2-1-1-1,"Correct. I'm too lazy to disable CSS or subscribe, so no upvote, but you need not reapply. If anything reapplying will delay the later initial applications.They had millions of applications over the weekend. I think NPR said 8 million in ""beta"" and 4 million more just Monday. It's now Friday AM. This may take some time."
22-5-1-1-4,"Did you get access to and sign up during the ""beta"" or ""test"" or whatever they called the brief early enrollment?"
23,"Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman started 'shouting' at Biden's national security advisor when he brought up Jamal Khashoggi's brutal killing, report says"

23-1-1,Dipshit should have paid off someone that isn't a slimy conman with two conmen's names behind him.
23-1-1-1,"Or get this, he should have thought twice before killing a high-profile journalist in a developed country with which they have very poor relations with."
23-1-1-1-1,I feel like he was trying to prove something considering he’s young and is the ruler of the Saudis and so doing something like killing Khashoggi was a way of instilling fear in people over and kind of telling others “Don’t mess with me. This can also happen to you”… I thought what he did was absolutely ridiculous. So much for reforming things over there. Unfortunately he ruined his polished look with the murder of this journalist. Completely uncalled for

23-1-2-1-1-1,"Homelander is pretty smart and charismatic tho, the other guy seems struggling with common sense"
23-1-2-1-1-1-1,Homelander is not smart. He just has the power to kill everyone around him instantly.
23-1-4,"Lol Suspicious, who received that payment? They're probably suspicious also"
23-1-4-1,Kushner
23-2,They should bring it up every time.
23-2-1,Should bring up Mohammad Atta too.
23-2-1-1,There's guys like Jared Kushner who for $2 Billion helped Saudi prince MBS cover up the Kashoggi murder; hand over top secret intel so MBS could target and knock out his competitor cousins for the throne (who were our assets for years); AND arrange arms deals for Saudi.
23-2-1-1-1,"I  still don't understand why US is so harsh on Iran yet so soft on Saudi Arabia, when Saudies are arguably worse than Iran in every way. Not even considering they were responsible for 9/11"
23-2-1-1-1-3,Because Saudi Arabia teamed up with us to train terrorist organizations to fight a proxy war against Russia in the Soviet Afghan war and it led to the downfall of the USSR. Iran supports Russia.
23-2-1-1-1-4,Saudis not responsible for 9 eleven. In fact bin laden was expelled from Saudi Arábia. His money confiscated. That is the reason he was living in Afghanistan. It does happen russia does want to drive edge between us and allies. That's why that false alegation got viralBut it's false. Saudis even revoked Osama citizenship
23-2-1-1-1-4-2,"Ok, but Osama was only one of like 20 Saudis that performed the attack. How do we excuse all the others?"
23-2-1-1-1-4-3,Not according to new government documents released by the Biden administration.
23-2-1-1-2,Well it sounds like Kushner committed treason.
23-2-1-1-2-1,"Technically not treason. But still, CIA said fuck no you are not getting a security clearance (edit: specifically SCI) after pulling this shit and Trump had to personally override them to grant it."
23-2-1-1-2-1-1,"The act itself is what treason historically is, but not punishable as such under current law."
23-2-1-1-2-1-1-1,"Under the current legal system, nothing is punishable for a presidential family."
23-2-1-1-2-1-1-2,"No its not.  Treason has historically meant waging war against your home country or helping their enemies.  Saudi Arabia aren't our enemies, we're not at war with them and Kushner did not wage war against the United States.  With treason the context is always war.> Article III, Section 3, Clause 1: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.If anything giving classified information to Saudi Arabia would be espionage."
23-2-1-1-2-3,He did but good luck getting him to trial with so many shill republican judges that trump and mcconnell forced through
23-2-1-1-2-3-1,"So basically if there is no one that will check you, the way the current law is written the President can be a dictator"
23-2-1-1-2-3-1-1,"Sorta, congress and the house of parliament are meant to serve as checks and balances to prevent a dictatorship, but the found fathers never imagined that the very checks and balances they put in place would be used to dismantle the country. This is why they believed that a 2 party system would be doom to failure"
23-2-1-1-2-5,"Not technically but he committed high crimes. Threading the ""treason"" needle is a hyper-specific task."

23-2-4-2-4,"Why in the hell would they do that?? They all benefit immensely from a lot of convenience subsidized by oil (no matter how dirty).It ain't Syria or sudan lol, most citizens support the regime."
23-2-4-2-5,How could they? It’s both practically and fundamentally impossible for that to happen.
23-2-5,Would be a shame if something happened to all these crazy rich people that made them choke on their humanity an realized that we're all equal in the galaxy. How interesting that would be...
23-3,Another reason I want to get off oil: so we're not beholden to these fuckin' pricks any longer.
23-3-1,Two things piss me off : dependency on dictators for oil and TPS reports.
23-3-1-1,"Hello Peter, what’s happening? Listen, are you gonna have those TPS reports for us this afternoon?"
23-3-1-1-2,"Oh and remember; next Friday is... Hawaiian shirt day. Soooo, ya know... if you want to, go ahead and wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans."
23-3-1-1-2-1,Samir Naghe…Nagha…not-gonna-work-here anymore anyway
23-3-1-2,It's just that we're putting new cover sheets on *all* TPS reports now.
23-3-1-2-2,Rrrrrrriiiiiiight
23-3-1-3,"There are only two things I can't stand in this world: People who are intolerant of other people's cultures, and the Dutch."
23-3-2,"Another extremely relevant reason is: no matter how you cut it, long term we will be using renewable energy and oil will likely eventually be gone, so why not spend the R&D now and become a world leader in it, instead of snoozing and let others get ahead on something as important as the energy sector? It just seems like such an obvious thing."
23-3-2-3,Short term thinking
23-3-4,Boy are going to be upset when you realize they are on track to not be dependent on oil by 2030.Their second largest exports are ammonia and lye. Both used in farming and guess who their #2 importer of it is?
23-3-5,"America buys almost none of it’s oil from Saudi. Canada is the largest supplier, and I assure you we aren’t a dictatorship."
23-3-5-1,"But Saudi production helps keep oil prices down. SA could kneecap global economies by shutting off supply, driving up the price of everything we import, driving up the price of gasoline etc.Getting off oil, at least for energy production, is essential if we are to really cut ties with some of these merciless autocracies."
23-3-5-2,"Our buying oil from Canada means Canada isn't selling to Europe, which is. Oil is a global market, its why cutting off Russia raises prices, even though we buy almost none of our oil from them either."
23-3-5-3,"Petro dollar. Anyone who buys Saudi oil has to do so using US currency, thereby keeping the US dollar in circulation and propping up the US economy. That is why the US sucks Saudi cock so often. You're not wrong, but you're omitting the most important fact."
23-4,"Oh shut your goddamn mouth, Salmon.I fucking hate the fact we have a relationship with the Saudis. They help commit 9/11, fund extremists around the world, start proxy wars that devastate civilian populations and lead to further extremism, abuse their own citizens on a daily basis, but our government says it's all okay because they like to buy guns from us, even as they continue to murder our workers and citizens.All those years in Iraq and Afghanistan, when the real threat was sitting right there laughing their asses off alongside our corrupt politicians."
23-4-1,"15 of 19 9/11 hijackers. I'm sure the House of Saud would prefer we all forget that inconvenient fact, but I never will."
23-4-1-1,"Unfortunately most of the country has, and both political parties are united in trying to cover it up or ignore it. Bush deflecting investigations and literally starting the unjustified wars, Obama trying to block lawsuits years after the fact, Trump trying to ramp up the gun-running and fund more terrorism for our military industrial complex to make bank off of, and now Biden still bothering to kowtow to them. Too much blood money to be made, those 3,000 people never really mattered."
23-4-1-2,"The Saudi government are turds, but the 15 hijackers is a really stupid point. Thet were Saudis but there is no evidence they were working at the behest of the Saudi government.Osama Bin Laden's father was powerful Saudi construction magnate and friends with the the king. But OBL was one of 50 or so kids to almost as many wives who met his father literally once and was not in the good graces of the government: one of his express reasons for his animosity towards America is because the Saudi government invited ""infidel"" American troops onto Saudi soil. The caliphate he enivsioned did not involve the house of Saud. The religous fanatics like OBL and his followers do not see the dynasty as allies.Being from a country does not mean you are working at the behest of the government of that country.Like in any country, Saudis are not all unified."
23-4-1-2-3,"No evidence? None? Funny enough, [it's been in the news] that the FBI has had knowledge of a Saudi spy who had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attack. No evidence? There's at least some."
23-4-2,"When the world finally rids itself of oil, there will be so many interesting downstream effects.  The fall of the Saudis is one I cannot wait to observe."
23-4-2-1,"So the worst case scenario is that SA as a country isn’t so rich anymore, but all the princes that have billions in investments that they bought with stolen money are just going to move to their mansions in London and Beverly Hills. Meanwhile the citizens will be left to live with the repercussions.There is no justice to observe."
23-4-2-3,"I hope you live a helluva long time, then. I don't see it happening any time soon."
23-4-3,"We buy their crude oil and refine it and sell them guns.  Our government is full of corporate executives who enjoy the benefits of this relationship.  The Saudis and the Americans both (among certain groups of people) wanted 9/11 to happen because it meant spending more money on oil and guns.  I met an old man one day who said to me ""we invade a new country every decade.  9/11 was just the country trimming its nails before a fist fight."""
23-4-4,"Realpolitik at its best. Share no common values, but enemy of Iran so they’re our friend"
23-4-4-1,"Its not that, the Saudis have at least one prince living in America making sure that we are quietly on the best terms with them, basically the same way that lobbyists do it. Get as many politicians on your side and in your pocket as possible and you can get away with murder."
23-5,"The Saudis are fascist, hypocritical, zealots who run their country like Germany in 1942."
23-5-1,"Plus, they toppled the WTC"
23-5-1-1,"No, no - it was Saddam. He tried to kill Bush-the-lesser's dad! I mean, he had weapons of mass destruction! I mean, he attacked us on 9/11! I mean, he shared an ideological bond with al-Qaeda! I mean...Fuckin' ayes right the Saudis stabbed us in the back on 9/11. Nobody ever talks about it, though."
23-5-1-1-1,We’re just supposed to never forget and shut up about the details
23-5-1-1-1-3,">**Bin Laden Family Evacuated**>Two dozen members of Osama bin Laden's family were urgently evacuated from the United States in the first days following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, according to the Saudi ambassador to Washington.>...>Most of bin Laden's relatives were attending high school and college. The young members of the bin Laden family were driven or flown under FBI supervision to a secret place in Texas and then to Washington, The Times reported Sunday.>...>They left the country on a private charter plane when airports reopened three days after the attacks.>**Congress passes Saudi 9/11 lawsuits bill**>**20 years after 9/11, lawsuit against Saudis hits key moment**"
23-5-1-1-1-4,DAT OIL THO
23-5-1-1-2,"The Saudis don't talk about it because they are too busy walking through our country like they own the place. Considering who they paid, certainly makes sense."
23-5-1-1-2-1,They DO own the place.... what other excuse is there for there never being any justice or true reprisal for 9/11?
23-5-1-1-3,"Once the oil dries, the west don't even have to do a thing, their neighbour will eat the Saudis for breakfast."
23-5-1-1-3-1,"They have proven oil reserves for 220 years... And a *huge* royal fund that they use to advance their own interests by buying Western leaders & elites...Even if we switched to 100% renewables in the next 20 years, due to their accumulated wealth, they'll still have *huge* influence for decades after that, (if properly invested & managed it could even be centuries...)"
23-5-1-1-3-1-1,We can stop using oil and use sanctions against them. Isolate them.
23-5-1-1-4,Its all contained in that special CIA napkin...
23-5-1-1-4-1,Cradle of fuckin’ CIVILIZATION
23-5-1-2,"We are supposed to believe that unnamed terrorists, with no tie to the Saudis burned down the twin towers. We are also supposed to forget the extensive ties the Bush family had with the Saudi regime and forget that members of the Saudi royal family were flown out of New York days after 9/11 when Americans could not even get back into their own country"
23-5-1-2-3,">members of the Saudi royal family were flown out of New YorkMembers of Bin Laden's direct family were flown out, but he had dozens of family members. This was reported about at the time, it wasn't some secret only later exposed, everyone expected some sort of retribution against Bin Laden as he was responsible. Preventing his family being attacked unnecessarily was probably a good thing.>We are supposed to believe that unnamed terrorists with no tie to the SaudisAfter 20 years, what evidence has come to light that shows the Saudi government were in cahoots?"
23-5-1-2-3-2,They are literally the ones who bankrolled the wahabist ideology. It's well known.
23-5-1-3,"While the Saudi government is shit, they disliked Osama bin Laden as much as anyone else. They had arrest warrants out for him prior to 9/11."
23-5-1-4,"There is still no substantial evidence that the Saudi Government, despite how bad, was involved in 9/11"
23-5-1-4-1,And there’s literally 0 evidence of the afghan or Iraq government being involved in 9/11 and yet both countries were invaded…
23-5-1-4-1-2,The US government being idiots didn't give Reddit immunity to be idiots
23-5-1-4-2,"Evidence doesn't matter to popular Reddit talking points, unfortunately.Plus they can just come back and say the majority of the hijackers were Saudi, therefore Saudis are still to blame, despite the context and history of Bin Laden/Al Qaeda and their tumultuous relationship with the Saudi government."
23-5-1-4-2-1,"The Saudis are who bankrolled and supported Wahabism to the hilt. I'm sure the top levels of the Saudi royal family didn't literally give the order, but they provided funding and support for those who did. Plausible deniability is textbook for shit like this. Just like when the US funds terrorists, death squads, and drug cartels, the actual source of funding and support will go through several intermediaries so that it is incredibly difficult to ""prove"" anything."
23-5-1-4-2-1-1,"It's more complicated than that. Al Qaeda is rooted in Salafism rather than Wahabism, and one of their early declared enemies was the House of Saud. Why would they bankroll a terror org that wants to topple them?Some members of the royal family almost definitely supported AQ, but it wouldnt make sense for the inner family to be complicit."
23-5-1-4-2-1-1-2,Governments covertly fund groups that are officially opposed to them all the time.
23-5-1-4-2-1-2,"Sure, but this ignores the history of conflict between Saudi Arabia's government and the Wahabi religious leaders. This is especially relevant post Persian Gulf War, when Bin Laden/Al Qaeda explicitly turned against the Saudi government for working with the US.I don't quite agree that Saudi funding of a religious ideology that would eventually spawn a separate group, al-Qaeda, says all that much. From what I've seen on Reddit, when people bring up Saudi Arabia and their relationship to 9/11, the conversation usually devolves into completely blaming the Saudi government as if it was official Saudi policy to be supporting al-Qaeda. There's currently no substantial evidence to support this.Then, the conversation usually goes to something along the lines of how the US had no reason to invade Afghanistan at all, which flies in the face of actual history and the Taliban's much more direct harboring of Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. You can see these ideas all over this very post.Cheers"
23-5-1-4-2-1-2-1,"The idea that you cant blame the Saudi government is insane when you take into account that their government is literally just a family of insanely wealthy people.Also, if that's why we invaded Afghanistan then why didn't we invade Pakistan who literally was harbouring bin Laden for a decade.Is it just to punish them? Fuck the country up cuz we're mad?"
23-5-1-4-2-2,Evidence doesn't matter to anyone with any ability to do anything about it anyway. Realpolitik.
23-5-1-4-2-2-1,"Sure, but that's an entirely different conversation. Evidence and truth are still important with or without the ability to do anything about it."
23-5-1-4-2-3,It’s flat out a racist conspiracy theory. End of story. Yes the saudis are Muslim Arabs who did have the bombers home country. That’s all we know there. There’s zero evidence of the Saudi government sanctioning a terrorist attack on New York city
23-5-1-4-2-3-1,"I honestly don’t think it’s simply racism. It’s racist to blame all Arabs, but they’re specifically blaming one Arab country and it’s government."
23-5-1-4-3,They've executed hundreds of al Qaeda members and sympathizers since.I don't complain.
23-5-1-4-4,This is worldnews.  This is specifically for pushing agenda.  Lack of evidence is a mandatory requirement.
23-5-1-4-5,They (the govt) don’t have to. It was still done by saudis.
23-5-1-4-5-1,>It was still done by saudis.Saudis as a people? Or the Saudi government? These are two different things. It's equally false to blame the Saudi people for 9/11
23-5-1-4-5-1-1,"Well, you blamed the Afghans. And then invaded the entire nation.However false it is to blame the Saudi people….. it’s a catastrophic cluster fuck of the highest order to blame fucking Afghanistan.Wouldn’t you say…?"
23-5-1-4-5-1-1-2,"No actually they blamed the Taliban, the ruling government of Afghanistan at the time, for sheltering Al Qaeda and Bin Laden and not all of Afghanistan. That's why they invaded."
23-5-1-4-5-1-1-4,">Well, you blamed the Afghans. And then invaded the entire nation.Your severe lack of knowledge in history and ignorance is showing.There's a reason why no one really criticizes US for going into Afghanistan even if we criticize US for going into Iraq."
23-5-1-4-5-2,"No, the issue is that the Saudi Government had ties to it. We've always known the nationality of the hijackers, but what matters is the government's knowledge. I may hate what Saudi Arabia represents, but I won't bring myself to start hating the regular civilians just for the association. Same with China or North Korea or Iran or whoever."
23-5-1-4-5-2-1,">No, the issue is that the Saudi Government had ties to it.I've never seen evidence that supports the idea that the Saudi government was somehow involved in carrying out 9/11. Having ties to something is quite vague, but I'd be interested in reading more about these ties if you could link some info.Cheers"
23-5-1-4-5-2-2,What about Afghanistan. The county we invaded
23-5-1-5,"Hey, that's an exaggeration.  As many as 20% of the 9/11 hijackers were from countries other than Saudi Arabia..."
23-5-2,"Not arguing that they're awful - hard to get worse than stoning a woman to death because she was raped, but how are they fascists?  I'd say they're a regressive monarchy pretending to be a theocracy."
23-5-2-1,Because they're a highly militarised society built on social darwinist theories of racial competition who advocate perpetual war with their neighbours to ensure the fitness of their state and people... apparently.
23-5-2-1-1,"Those aren't core tenants of fascism. That's militarism with a dash of eugenics. Facism, according to Wikipedia (which though not authoritative is pretty accurate here IMO) is  ""a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism\[1\] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy\[2\] that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe"".SA fits far-right, authoritarianism, dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and economy. Only ultranationalism isn't a perfect fit, as they are more oligarchical, plutocratic, and religious than focused on the idea of their national identity."
23-5-2-1-1-1,Ultra nationalism and religious are  interchangeable in that definition. Because both are about creating a sense of 'us' and 'other' so extreme that the 'other' becomes dehumanized.Just look at how American evangelicals talk about atheists. Beware the contamination of the godless liberals! It's the same BS that the nationalists spew.
23-5-2-1-3,Did you just make all that up?
23-5-3,So why not sanction them like a certain other country? Oh yeah it benefits US…
23-5-4,"Saudi Arabia sucks so bad it didn’t abolish slavery until 1962, and people say that even then they were just faking."
23-5-4-1,Bruh. You do realize that slavery in America was the absolute worst human right violation in last 2 centuries. Slavery in the Arab world back then was not common and also was not racially charged.
24,Biden vows to crack down on colleges 'jacking up costs' and causing student debt to spiral after Trump 'looked the other way'
24-1,"When I went to school, they said it was a guaranteed rate for the next four years. They promised our tuition wouldn’t go up. Then as a sophomore it went up and they told us to go fuck ourselves."
24-1-1,"I feel like the cost SHOULD be locked in at freshman year. If they want to raise tuition it needs to be for NEW students who can still opt out. My tuition at a state school quadrupled during the four years I attended -- what am I supposed to do, drop out?"
24-1-1-1,"Yeah, I paid $1600 out of pocket, after loans and grants and scholarships. Sophomore year it jumped to $5000 and I cried for two days because that was almost all of the money I had made that summer too. And by the time I got to my senior year I stopped crying and stopped eating at the dining hall. I showed up week three of my senior year fall semester to the financial aid office with my completed food stamps application and my grocery bill receipts. I told them to check the dining hall scans because my card had not been used and they needed to take the meal plan off my account because I couldn’t afford it. They magically found a way to eliminate it from my account that day.What was I supposed to do? Drop out junior year? I already didn’t get to study abroad."
24-1-1-1-1,That was depressing to read.
24-1-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, it’s depressing as fuck to see classmates from high school demonizing the student loan forgiveness. We’re all crabs in a bucket here."
24-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Oh my fucking God.I have never felt so heard.I went out of school on scholarship.My scholarship was then REDUCED with no explanation.My applied professor told me that I'm ""not performing at the level we're paying you at.""Trauma.Trauma.Trauma."
24-1-1-1-1-1-3,"Those classmates that scorned college or had mama and papa pay their way through, I’d bet."
24-1-2,"I don't like that were always talking about just ""tuition,"" because a huge portion of student debt is really due to other fees associated with attending college. I feel like even if legislation is passed to cap tuition, they'll just keep raising the fees"
24-1-2-1,On campus housing and dining options prices skyrocket.Oh by the way we also mandate that freshmen live on campus and have the basic meal plan.
24-1-2-1-1,"my university mandated all freshmen take the second largest dining plan.and the dining points didn't roll over across semesters.so every semester, around finals week, you'd see freshmen carrying full flats of 24 gatorade or whatever they could spend bulk points on, it was ridiculous."
24-1-2-1-1-1,"Holy shit.So were dining points basically buy-at-volume store and canteen credit? They’re not really a thing in the UK (or at least not the campus I was on) so it’s not really a familiar concept.Edit: [okay it does exist here], a whole 10% for effectively direct debiting onto a prepay card weekly, “_bargain_”I was expecting like, pay £40 and get £60 to spend"
24-1-2-1-1-1-1,"At my school it was more like pay $500 and get $300 to spend, and everything you could spend it on was inflated in price too."
24-1-2-1-1-1-2,"essentially, yes. my university would charge a lump sum at the beginning, and your ""dining point balance"" would hold a semester's worth of points to spend.and then they'd pocket the remainder at the end of each semester lmaothey also claimed there was a 50% discount when you used dining points, but each point cost $2 so it was meaningless"
24-1-2-1-1-1-2-1,"Oh wow, and of course university food is overpriced too"
24-1-2-1-2,Off campus housing in college towns is mostly run by slumlords and giant corporate apartment complexes. It's not any cheaper
24-1-2-1-2-1,"Live in Denton, can confirm"
24-1-2-1-2-1-1,"Oof, ain't that the fucking truth. Garbage ass landlords can't fuckin fix anything *and* increase the rentSource: also live in Denton"
24-1-2-1-2-1-3,"Not sure how Denton was but San Marcos seemed pretty reasonable.  My last semester though I wasnt going full time so I met the criteria for ""government subsidized"" apartments which were pretty nice.  I think my rent topped out at $675 and it was the biggest/nicest place I had ever stayed at.  Now I live in an old ass house smaller than that apartment in southern CO with no AC (ive measured 93 inside the house during summer) for $900/mo.  I have the added benefit of homeless/transients starting fires across the street as well which is pretty cool (not)."
24-1-2-1-2-2,Me and my 3 friends rented an old Victorian style house 4 blocks from campus.  It was $1250/mo + utilities.  We were fortunate to not have any landlord issues.
24-1-2-1-2-2-1,"Shiiit, I rent a similarly old 1-bed-1-bath apartment for almost that price lol.  College town…so yeah, it’s overpriced."
24-1-2-1-2-2-1-1,"The biggest problem we had, is that since it was super old, it was poorly insulated.  We set the thermostat to 50 in the winter, closed the pocket doors to the living room, and warmed one room in the house with a little space heater.  Fans in the summer pushing cooler air up from the basement to the living areas."
24-1-2-1-2-2-5,Ohio State? The price of my rent at my now former place several blocks south of campus went from $600/month to $2000/month over the span of fifteen years.
24-1-2-1-2-5,"Mostly, it's best to rent a room from a regular individual that either lives in the property or did prior and now rents it out . All my best rooms during college were that situation. All my worst were obviously people that rented out multiple properties specifically to students. Awful."
24-1-2-1-2-5-1,"Yeah. College students should be very cautious of this. Apartment complexes in college towns know that most of their renters are new to living on their own and dealing with landlords so they'll cut corners or do other shady things. I remember when I got my security deposit back there was an ""adding error"" $100 in their favor. Just always be watching out and keep receipts for everything."
24-1-2-1-3,"This is exactly what is happening with the SUNY system in NY. In state tuition was capped around $3,500 when I went, but housing and meal plans (which were required if you lived in a non cooking dorm) came out to around $12,000 a year and you were only allowed to be onsite for like ~8 months a year. That’s like $1500 for rent and food."
24-1-2-1-3-1,The thing that killed me is some colleges actually kick students out of the on-campus housing during summer or over Christmas break.My exgf had 2 classmates that had to stay with her for 2 weeks because they *came from fucking france* and can't just fly home for the 2 week Christmas break but the campus locked down basically making them homeless.
24-1-2-1-3-1-2,"This is a very common issue for international students that's getting worse as smaller schools try to attract more international students (higher tuition) but don't have the resources to actually accomodate their needs. Even worse, many are getting lax on American academia norms (verified transcripts, English proficiency, understanding of plagiarism) and letting in students they probably shouldn't which sucks up so many other resources trying to get them to be successful."
24-1-2-1-3-1-2-1,"But they DO have the main prerequisite, of course.  They bring the money."
24-1-2-1-4,"This in particular annoyed the shit out of me. At the college I went to right now a meal plan is $2,200 minimum and the room and board is $5k. This is for basically 4 months, late August to mid December. That's $550 a month for food, $1250 on room and board. This is in the Midwest, where you can get nice apartments for like $800 and I struggle to spend $300 on food every month. So even factoring in utilities and such you're paying bank for NOTHING. You're basically paying like you're a working professional making relatively high wages to live in a box with another person with shared bathrooms and meals that taste like ass and probably cost them pennies to make. The whole thing is a scam and having worked at colleges before the admin sees nothing wrong with it. In fact, they keep hiring random admin people for random pet projects that have nothing to do with the school's mission."
24-1-2-1-4-1,"Don't a lot of those cafeterias get their food from the same places the prisons do, Aramak? SMH"
24-1-2-2,"Parking fee, technology fee, environmental fee, just because we can fee…"
24-1-2-2-2,"I just paid a $5 materials fee.... for a fully online class. *What* materials, exactly? There was also an ""academic achievement fee"" for no apparent reason. And this was a community college (Madison Area Technical College).The $7 per credit hour book rental fee is legit though. Makes all textbooks free to rent, and that's way less than the cost of most books."
24-1-3,"I’ll do you one better. Same promise. Rates went up each year year. Students complained. Told to go fuck off. Students gathered. Nothing. Students marched. Cops showed up with dogs. I worked for the student paper, and a cop hit our photographer across the face with a baton."
24-1-3-1,acab baby
24-1-4,This happened to me too! We ousted the President in response.
24-1-4-2,Did tuition go back down?
24-1-4-2-1,Not op but I think we can all assume it did not.
24-2,"Its pretty crazy that the US News college rankings and others could actually really quickly reduce nationwide tuition costs by just weighting it more heavily in their rankings. Universities fight tooth and nail for every single factor that goes into those rankings, often in ways that are expensive, and sadly tuition is basically a non-factor in them. The US schools in the top 15 charge around $60k tuition, which is absolutely nuts. Punish their ranking for that and the universities will actually work to make things cheaper.Edit: for those curious on ranking factors, you can check the US News criteria  [here]. Tuition is literally not a factor."
24-2-3,UF in state is 6800 a year. Top 5 public university in the nation.Florida is fucked up in a lot of ways. But we have laws on the books that keep all state university tuitions down.Of course cost of living racks in another $18-22k per year outside of tuition.
24-2-3-1,Can’t forget about bright futures. Tuition is free for Floridians who have a decent GPA and SAT with 100 community service hours.
24-2-3-1-1,Just don’t be gay or liberal 
24-2-3-2,Texas had this til the early 00’s. They let the state schools have free range on expenses and from my sophomore year to senior year my tuition almost doubled. I couldn’t get out fast enough
24-2-5,"Especially when you consider their endowments. Yale has a endowment of $43 billion, $3.5 million per student, and still charges a $62 thousand tuition! $80K including room and board.Yale could easily go zero tuition and still grow their endowment. Their endowment grew by 10% per year the last 20 years, so they’re making $350K per student per year just from investments.Plus, the first top school with a $0 price tag would instantly stand above the rest. NYU Med School went from rank 27 back in 2010 to rank 2 today due to an admissions boom after going tuition free."
24-2-5-2,"Yale has expensive numbers on paper, but what students actually pay is pretty minimal. Students from middle and lower class families pay next to nothing."
24-2-5-2-1,"I wish it was so! Unfortunately, 46 percent of Yale students get zero financial aid. But happily that fraction continues to decrease. Perhaps one day all such schools will make it so that there are zero costs. Here’s to hoping my friend!"
24-2-5-2-1-1,"Maybe only about half of Yale students get financial aid, but 45% of their students come from the top 5% of income earning families. The median income for a student's family is over $192k each year. Seriously, the cost of Yale has basically no relevance when it comes to talking about changes that need to be made to our country's academic institutions."
24-2-5-3,Why should everyone go for free when half of them come from families that absolutely do not struggle financially?The other 50% receive need-based financial aid that is currently among the most generous in the country.
24-2-5-3-1,"I don’t think anyone should pay for education, at any level Pre-K to University. I got a degree in Europe where everyone paid a very small affordable fee, what you’d pay for text books in most American schools. Yes, they could charge a special fee if you’re rich I suppose, but you could say that for any good/service. A school with $43 billion, more than the GDP of entire states, doesn’t need to charge students anything in my opinion. More generally I think people shouldn’t have to pay to get educated (other than paying taxes, which should be greater for the rich)."
24-2-5-3-1-1,"I completely agree and absolutely think that access to money should not be a hurdle when getting an education and I can only hope that there will be a free college option for everyone in the future. However, I will say that American universities offer more than typical European ones when it comes to extracurriculars (especially for top universities) and the number of these extracurricular options grows proportionally with endowment size. For this reason I don't think an assessment of ""the endowment per student is x, and is greater than the tuition of y, which is why it should be free for everyone"". That money gets earmarked for many things outside of the classroom.Getting rid of excessive six-figure administrative positions and raising the thresholds for financial aid seems like a more practical approach than fully cutting tuition across the board for both poor students and children of multi-millionaires."
24-3,"My wife finished a PharmD this year. When she started it was $60k a year. By the final year it was $70k. They didn’t even have a coffee shop on campus ffs.During the pandemic they unsurprisingly carried on charging them the same amount, even though they weren’t on campus and when my wife asked for a breakdown of where the money was going, they just gave her the runaround and then eventually refused to give her the information.The whole thing is a fucking joke."
24-3-1,"I can tell you that that money does not go to paying professors, especially an adjunct. Adjuncts get paid a few thousand for a semester of teaching one class. Many electives and lower levels are taught by adjuncts. So you’re paying $60K in tuition and only maybe $100 goes to the adjunct for one class (assuming the class is about 20-30 people). Full professors don’t fair any better either as their salaries have been stagnant for two decades. And this trend has been increasing rapidly."
24-3-1-1,"My community college almost lost their profs to a strike because there hadn't been a pay raise in yearsEventually they worked things out, but it wasn't exactly a pay raise. The district cut two weeks off of the semesters (and eliminated an actual finals week), but the profs salary was still the same as before. So on a technical level they were getting paid more for having to work two weeks a semester less than what they were, but the number value did not change"
24-3-1-1-1,"But the students paid less in tuition since they were in class less, right? *Right?!*"
24-3-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, nah"
24-3-1-3,It mostly goes to administrators and facilities
24-3-1-4,"As someone who is both a PharmD and a professor, I can concur. My debt load is huge ($250K) and my salary is laughable. Admins all got a sweet pay raise this year though."
24-3-2,"Went to one of the 3 accredited architecture schools in the state.Two semesters. 30 credits.2004 year cost $13,0002022 year cost $39,000Unless you go for your masters and become licensed. Don't expect more than $50,000 a year. (Michigan)So just for a bachelors. Your looking at a minimum of $160,000. If you don't have to worry about housing or anything."
24-3-3,"They preinvest tuition for future projects and don't think they should be on the hook when their cash cow ""guarantee"" takes a hit. All the tuition money forecast for 2019-2022 was already prespent in like, 2015."
24-3-3-1,"Not great, but that seems a lot more responsible or sane  than I would have thought. I'm trying to understand exactly what, practically, a $60,000 per student tuition would be paying for...?  In addition to the various other fees, possibly sports income, advertising, alumni funding, donations, government grants, research program payouts, and other income...?This seems like money laundering or some other institutiinal corruption to me, more than being a bit irresponsible.I get that there are some, especially science and engineering, programs that can be expensive. But even still."
24-3-3-1-1,"That's what I want to know. I went to a university wth 50,000 students. If each kid pays $8,000/year (this was 10 years ago at an affordable school) isn't that $400 million a year? I want to see a budget."
24-3-5,"> My wife finished a PharmD this year. When she started it was $60k a year. By the final year it was $70k. They didn’t even have a coffee shop on campus ffs.But all the ~~admin staff~~ administrators, and the CEO running the school like a business, and all the football coaches, and the amazing sports arenas - which all cost good money - those are an important part of **education**, innit? /s"
24-4,"You know the absolute best way to crack down on outrageous costs?  Make public colleges tuition free, like they were until the mid-60's."
24-4-1,"Or only allow pell grant and gov loans (at 0 to 1% interest to cover default rate) to be offered at schools whose TOTAL attendance cost doesn't go up more than certain inflation indexes. That would be easy, then tie free tuition to paths that are projected to be in demand in 5 to 10 years (by demand I don't mean flood a market to drive wages down for corporate profits)."
24-4-2,"In less than 2 years, Biden has made progress on nearly every progressive priority (except weed legalization, immigration reform and prison reform/police reform).. his constructive half measures are meant to make it palatable for moderates, shifting the overton window to the left..If we elect a truly progressive president the groundwork has already been laid.. maybe we don't have time for half measures in some areas, but with such a fucked up electoral system and narrow control of Congress, what he's done is highly praise worthy"
24-4-2-1,"Biden was one of my last choices in the primary to be honest.Be after the last month, it's hard to imagine anyone in all of politics doing as much, nevermind *more*, than he has done on such a thin congressional margin."
24-4-2-1-1,"Sometimes it’s good to be reminded that politics is a skill and being a “career politician” isn’t always a bad thing. I’m right there with you, I wasn’t happy when he won the nomination, but the man knows wtf he’s doing. That alone is a huge upgrade over the previous administration…"
24-4-2-1-1-1,"I also voted against trump.I'm still mad about the Marijuana classification, but holy moly is it nice to have a steady hand back on the wheel.His biggest scandals are trump lmao."
24-4-2-1-1-1-1,"It feels nice having an actual human being as president again. Always funny when republicans use shit like stuttering or stumbling as a catch-22 for Biden being incompetent; in reality it just makes him more human.Nobody expects a president to be god. But I’d certainly hope a president would at least be better than trump, which Biden is."
24-4-2-1-1-1-2,He was serious about cutting the malarkey
24-4-2-1-1-2,"Yeah as lame as it is to have most realistic candidates be 70+, the president is the one position where I’m fine having someone older, as long as they have the experience to match"
24-4-2-1-1-3,That’s why I think term limits are silly. In no other job would you force somebody to leave because they got good at it. I like competence.
24-4-2-1-2,"Same. I would've taken 3-4 over him, not including my favorites who I wouldve been legitimately happy to vote for (Sanders or Warren). That said, he's been more than pragmatic, arguable productive."
24-4-2-1-4,"On the other hand, it's unlikely that the congressional makeup would be the same if another candidate won the primary. Bernie might have energized left wing voters and right wing voters alike to vote and vote down the ballot.Edit: I'm not saying right wingers would vote for Bernie"
24-4-2-1-4-1,"Not based on polling he wouldn’t have. Bernie was distinctly unpopular with independent & centrist Dem voters. It’s one reason why he failed both primaries (his campaign learning NOTHING from 2015 apparently).It’s quite likely we would have lost the Senate with him, which would mean zip would have happened."
24-4-2-1-4-1-1,"If you think Republicans would control the senate if Bernie beat Biden in the primary, then you agree with my point: no other candidate would have ended up with the congressional makeup we currently have."
24-4-2-1-4-2,How would he have gone about doing that?
24-4-2-3,We need a progressive congress and Senate. It's time that the president's power be reduced. I'd rather have a relatively moderate president and a progressive Senate than a progressive president with a Senate full of Manchins.
24-4-2-3-1,It's incredible how people can't grasp that someone like Trump is only dangerous because we've given the office of President so much more power than it was ever intended to have
24-4-2-3-1-1,"I think it's partly that way because our legislative branch, the one that's supposed to have all the power, is less effective than a kindergarten kickball team. The executive branch steps up in the form of EO's when legislation is impossible due to fractured partisan ideologies and corporate lobbying."
24-4-2-4,"The number one priority of mine, and I consider myself a progressive, is universal health care.I'm a highly skilled, well paid worker. Top 5% for US incomes. And even with the best insurance my company provides, I cannot come close to affording the psychiatric meds prescribed to my wife last week. $1200 copay per month for one pill per day. It's not a biologic therapy or anything special like that, just a small molecule that they have been able to synthesize for twenty years now. In Canada it's cheap. She's talking to her doctors about other options.I have yet to see Biden do anything about this."
24-4-3,"He tried to do that at the beginning of his presidency, private university lobby bought half the dem party and shut it down"
24-5,"My husband was doing the math on the current trend of colleges jacking up rates every year and calculated that an undergraduate education would cost half a million for our kindergartener if the trend continues. It's insane.Edit: For clarification, we're talking about the projected out-of-state tuition at a good public university in 2035. Right now, it's $30-$50K (or more) per year, and would be more than $100K in 2035. In-state tuition would be about 1/3-1/4 of that, while private schools could be considerably more."
24-5-1,"Yeah I recently got a financial planner. When discussing saving for college for our preschooler, they said be prepared in the ball park of $80k for a public university, PER YEAR. They said we'd have to put away about a grand a month to possibly achieve that.That is insane."
24-5-1-1,"I'm not sure what the tipping point is, but that is literally not sustainable."
24-5-1-2,"Its such a gamble too. Not all kids will use that tuition wisely. They may drop out. Its insane.Edit: would just like to add, some european countries their education is free. In ireland you could go to the top schools and pay nothing unless it was to be a medical doctor."
24-5-1-2-1,"Yeah that was my concern. I asked my planner, ""what if my child opts not to go to college or gets a bunch of scholarships?"" Basically I could pass that money on to any potential grandkids, which would be great, but also I could use a lot of that money now for long-term savings/my retirement.Basically we are going to put away a more reasonable amount per month for now in hopes to pay for some college. But really the hope is the issue of rising costs is tackled before we have a kid old enough to attend college in ~15years. It sucks that you won't be able to do more as a parent, but I certainly don't have an extra $1k a month to put away."
24-5-1-2-1-1,"Well when I went to college they actually factored in my mom's (single parent) income when i went for financial aid. Luckily she had retired just before the threshold so in their eyes she was broke but if that weren't the case they would have expected her to foot the bill, whether she had savings or was truly financially capable it didn't matter. I've even heard of people denied federal loans because they went no contact with their abusive parents. How can you de facto make it someone else's responsibility? shit's messed up."
24-5-1-2-1-2,Colleges will be their own demise. So many people can self teach now with the internet. My dorm mate did political science in college. Was no use to them. They then taught themselves computer programming and is now an upper level manager for Ebay.
24-5-2,"At like a state school? It cost $125,000-$160,000 more than ten years ago for some top private universities"
24-5-2-1,"The average in-state cost (total) for a public school is just shy of $30k/year for attendance. For out-of-state it's about $45k.&#x200B;For comparison-sake. Tuition alone for Harvard is $51k. They, however, also have a nice financial aid package which heavily benefit families that make less than 150k. Tuition free if you are low income."
24-5-2-1-1,"Yeah my kid goes to Cornell. Fall tuition was $32,000. I paid $1,800. She won't have any debt when she graduates. Feels good, man.I feel like all schools should have the same income based sliding scale, but they just can't resist that sweet, sweet easy credit rip-off money they get from student loans."
24-5-2-1-1-1,"TBF lots of schools don't sit on the same giant pile of cash that the Ivys have. The massive endowments allow them to use the interest to subsidize poorer students. Schools with smaller endowments, smaller pools of fantastically rich alumni donating regularly, etc are more reliant on tuition to justify all the shiny sports equipment, the excess of stadiums and other big ticket items they're constantly trying to pay for."
24-5-2-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, I understand the endowment thing. I was thinking of Texas, where she also got admitted, who has an enormous endowment, and wanted tens of thousands of dollars out of me for in-state."
24-5-2-1-2,"Penn State University - Out of state tuition: $38,651/year, In state: $19,286/ year.Without any extra grants or scholarships l, it costs PA residents almost $80,000k to earn a degree from the state’s flagship university."
24-5-2-1-2-2,"Wow, I also just took a look and the Schreyer Honors College scholarship, $5,000/year, I got all four years *has not been adjusted for inflation*.My actual, full cost of attendance in 2010-14  — including room and board; tuition was $13,604 — was $20k/year, so Schreyer used to take care of a full quarter of that.…what’s the point now if you don’t want to do an undergraduate thesis?! I know it’s still a lot of money, but honestly?!"
24-5-2-1-5,"Bullshit. Average tuition & fees is just north of 10k.>The average cost of tuition and fees to attend a ranked public college in state is about 73% less than the average sticker price at a private college, at $10,388 for the 2021-2022 year compared with $38,185, respectively, U.S. News data shows. The average cost for out-of-state students at public colleges comes to $22,698 for the same year."
24-5-2-1-5-1,>tuition>>The average in-state cost (**total**)Notice the difference? Total is not just tuition.
24-5-2-1-5-1-1,Young adults are going to have to pay rent and food costs regardless of if they're in college or not. Including it is stupid and misleading.
24-5-2-2,"Yup, some young people are racking up six figures of student loan debt for a bachelors degree at state schools now. It’s not the norm yet, but it will be soon at this rate."
24-5-2-2-1,"Well, young people today aren’t going to be able afford a home with the way that market is heading, so colleges are stepping up to ensure those kids still become lifelong debtors to the banks."
24-5-2-2-1-1,"Even making $95k currently, I feel like I can't afford a home. Almost everything on the west coast is $500k *starting*, and anywhere within 50 miles of a company I can work for with my career is $650k. Even with good credit, being single means banks won't lend to me even if I could theoretically afford a $3k/month mortgage.Young people (and I'm talking <35, not future young adults) today can't afford homes. Zoomers are just fucked completely."
24-5-2-2-1-1-1,People currently in their mid 30s were slammed with a massive global recession right as we were finishing or had just finished college.
24-5-2-2-1-1-2,"Yeah, I recently started working my first big boy job making 75k a year. Even when I started schooling the idea of 75k seemed amazing. I figured I wouldn't be rich, but I would at least be living comfortably.Now that rent is basically a minimum of $1,800 per month and the cost of gas and everything else has gone up so much since covid started I feel like I'm not even living much better than when I was scraping by during school. I mean yeah, I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but 75k a year definitely doesn't feel as comfortable as I expected it to. Trying to save up for a house also feels almost impossible with prices being stupidly high (yay Phoenix) and spending so much on rent.This just really isn't what I thought it would be like when I finally finished school."
24-5-2-2-1-1-2-1,What used to be 75k  is now 100k. That's why you don't feel comfortable.
24-5-2-4,"Yes, at a state school, not just private colleges. Particularly a state school in another state with out-of-state tuition."
24-5-5,"2.5 Years of Community College for all Lower Division Classes to save moneyGrants for Free Comm College for 2 years (California Promise Grant)Need one year of Residency in California to qualify (New York, Tenn., Oregon are other states with similar Grants)"

25,Biden to announce executive action to protect abortion access
25-1,"So from what I understand this would expand protection to the abortion pill, contraception, and IUD access as covered under the Affordable Care Act.It would not protect anyone from getting ""in office"" abortions right?"
25-1-1,">	So from what I understand this would expand protection to the abortion pill, contraception, and IUD access as covered under the Affordable Care Act.Wait, so these things weren’t covered under it before??"
25-1-1-1,A lot of things were sacrificed to get a few conservatives to sign on the ACA.  A major one being anything related to women's health.
25-1-1-1-1,"Yup ACA was gutted and made into a disaster before it was even signed in. The GOP ruined it so they can later look back and say, ""Look how ruined this is."""
25-1-1-1-1-1,It's an extremely effective strategy when the end goal is privatization.
25-1-1-1-1-1-1,How else are they going to launder those tax dollars into their friends pockets?
25-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Let’s go Brandon?Edit: sarcasm, aimed at Madison cawthorn or however the fuck you spell that scumbags name."
25-1-1-1-1-2,"Premiums have been climbing at a distinctly slower rate since ACA went into effect.Rag on it all you like, it certainly falls short, but without it we'd be in a *much* bigger mess right now."
25-1-1-1-1-2-1,"It's true. I'm hardcore M4A. I hare that Obama watered down the ACA as much as he did, but we would be so, so, so much worse off as a country if it hadn't been signed. Even conservatives realize this, which is why they've never made meaningful progress into dismantling it"
25-1-1-1-1-2-1-3,Max Baucus and Joe Lieberman watered down the ACA. Obama supported the House bill with the public option that Pelosi passed.
25-1-1-1-1-3,The entire premise of the ACA was already a handout to conservatives. This was their healthcare plan. Forcing people to buy inefficient and expensive private insurance on a government subsidized marketplace instead of just providing it directly.
25-1-1-1-1-5,"I don't know what you're talking about with this ""made into a disaster"" and ""ruined"" stuff.&nbsp;It was watered down, and still the most sweeping improvement to healthcare quality and access in the country in as along as any of us have been alive. And it's very popular now.&nbsp;The biggest problem with big programs, aside from getting them passed, is that it typically takes 2-to-3 years before the public have fully recognized the improvements in their lives and public opinion comes around. Then they're usually pretty bulletproof."
25-1-2,He doesn’t have the power to change regulations around in office abortions by himself
25-1-2-1,"Someone needs to swap his gas-price wheel for an abortion switch, smh.The number of people who need jokes explained to them is making me lose hope in humanity."
25-1-2-1-2,i mean i would rather pay $5 for gas and have rights rather than vice versa 
25-1-2-1-2-4,HOW BOUT NEITHER! don't forget to vote and donate.
25-1-2-1-2-4-2,Gas is a finite resource and we enjoy the cheapest gas in the workd
25-1-2-1-2-4-2-1,Syria has gas for $1/gallon.
25-1-2-1-2-4-2-2,Nah
25-1-2-1-2-5,"It’s funny because gas has consistently been cheaper in America than overseas. First time I saw the price at a pump in another country I almost passed out. It makes everything cheaper, food, meat, cause cheap transportation. I don’t see how it’s sustainable though."
25-1-2-3,"Fuck the SCOTUS, but with how shaky our democracy is right now, openly defying and subverting their ruling would only set a terrible precedent that the other side would abuse.Biden is doing all he can in the confines of the ruling, but it'd be shortsighted to do more."
25-1-2-3-1,The other side will abuse whatever they need to abuse to get their way regardless of what precedent is set.
25-1-2-3-1-1,"Case in point: our stacked Supreme CourtWhen it was Obama's pick, GOP opposed election year confirmation in the most precise language possible, literally saying they would still oppose it if the tables were turned and they had an opportunity during election year.We caved, and gave them the appointment. Then when the tables were turned after RBG? Fucking last minute SC pick, confirmed 2 weeks before Trump gets voted out of office, and replaced by a Justice with the complete opposite views, whereas Obamas pick was basically a conservative that they dared him to pick because they thought Obama would nominate a liberal.The hypocrisy is so disgustingly in your face that it's hard to believe this real life.  These are not legitimate actors. Don't give them a single inch."
25-1-2-3-1-3,Yeah the only thing that’ll change is their excuse for why they are abusing it.
25-1-2-3-1-3-1,"Like fucking Lindsey Graham refusing to confirm Garland because of the upcoming election and saying if the shoe was on the other foot, he would do the same thing. Then voting to confirm ACB because ""Democrats were mean to Kavanaugh"""
25-1-2-3-1-5,Institutional legitimacy is basically a façade at this point that keeps democratic hands tied and gives republican misdeeds undue authority.
25-1-2-3-2,"they're already abusing it.. if we don't set this precedent, they will, and for worse reasons."
25-1-2-3-2-1,That's bullshit. I want to live in a world where the rule of law is obeyed. Throwing it out the window doesn't get us closer to that vision.This chain is specifically talking about Biden illegally subverting the SCOTUS ruling. Breaking precedent is fine. Breaking the law is not.
25-1-2-3-3,"You know it's funny, I never seem to see conservatives wring their hands about about precedent and what liberals will abuse in the future. They just do things, and it works! They always get what they want using this method! How long until we drop these proven ineffective methods and learn from the conservatives? They're awful people, but they know how to get their shit done."
25-1-2-3-3-2,"They get their shit done through fucking fascism and anti-democracy. Almost like if we don’t have democratic principles, we are no better than them"
25-1-2-3-3-3,Well yeah fascism is really effective and really hard to beat without being fascist yourself.
25-1-2-3-3-3-1,"Fascism is not just breaking the rules, it's not a means it is an end. A whole political philosophy with its own ideas about everything from religion to the economy.You can argue that I was suggesting something too authoritarian if you want, but that's a different conversation."
25-1-2-3-4,"Yeah, because if one thing we know for sure it's that conservatives respect precedence and tradition when it stops them from getting what they want.After all, that's why they didn't overturn Roe or force through a nomination to the SCOTUS weeks before a presidental election... wait ..."
25-1-2-3-4-2,"Defying a supreme court ruling as the executive is not defying precedent and tradition, it's defying the constitution and the basis for your executive authority. The states would just refuse to follow the illegal executive order, and Biden would be completely impotent from then on, if not impeached."
25-1-4,"He can only do so much.  The president can try and influence domestic polices and laws but that is up to the house and to some degree the senate.   The president isn’t some sort of dictator that can just change things and he shouldn’t be.  We need to disband the senate and allow house to do their jobs.  But that will never happen, at least not in my lifetime."
25-1-4-3,Yeah a lot of people don't seem to understand that the president doesn't have absolute authority.
25-2,Short term this is a win. Longterm legislation is needed. We cannot be playing 4 year executive action on women's healthcare access.
25-2-1,"This 100% needs to happen fast. For all the grandstanding the GOP is doing about ""Just leave it up to the states"" and all the bullshit arguments about states rights to make the decision themselves, [GOP congressmen are already drafting a bill to ban abortion nationwide.] Proving once again that they are not the party of states rights and they are not the party of individual freedoms, they are the party of religious zealotry. Their goal will be to put this bill forward if they can take control of congress in November. And the supreme court will obviously let it happen. Biden can Veto but then all it takes is either a super majority to overrule the veto or waiting until they have the presidency again, which if they win in 2024 and this year then that would be the end of abortions nationwide."
25-2-1-1,Man that is terrifying. We really need the Anti-christ to show himself and save us from a DeSantis presidency is 2024.
25-2-1-1-1,"As a Floridian, DeathSantis and his idol Trump are probably about as close to the antichrist as we have."
25-2-1-1-1-1,IDK man they way Christian Nationalism has been raging I'd say the Anti-Christ might be a pretty cool guy if he's everything opposite of them lol
25-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Lol, that’s certainly true. Though from the mythology the antichrist is supposed to arise from within and will seem like a false savior. Seems to fit the bill for how the GOP has been using and radicalizing Christianity."
25-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Google ""trump antichrist"", there's a biblical scholar who points out a TON of indications that if the Bible were real, Trump is the antichrist.Trump was also born about 6 months after Hitler died.  According to Hindu reincarnation that's about how long it takes for a soul to find a new body"
25-2-2,"Everyone is talking about Congressional legislation, but what I don't get is how they think the Supreme Court won't just rule any new law as unconstitutional. They have done that in the past for other things."
25-2-2-1,Kinda crazy that ~~7~~ 9 unelected people can take away the ability of 100s of elected officials to govern.
25-2-2-1-1,The checks and balances we were told existed have been reduced to theater.
25-2-2-1-2,Kinda crazy how many people didn't take this seriously in 2016.
25-2-2-1-3,And people keep sucking off the constitution like it's the peak of mankind. What a joke.
25-2-2-1-3-1,2nd to 50 shades of grey imo.Fly Fishing by J. R. Hartley is close behind.
25-2-2-1-4,"They need to pack the court like literally today, pass laws surrounding abortion access, voting rights, and then SC reforms.Of course, this would require a spine, which it seems is severely lacking in the dem party."
25-2-2-2,Congress should amend the constitution then. The Supreme Court will have no power over that.
25-2-2-2-1,"That would take 290 votes in the House, 67 in the Senate, and 38 state legislatures. Do you honestly think that's a possibility in the current climate?"
25-2-2-2-3,"I mean the last amendment that was ratified (27th) was back in 1992 and it was a 202 year old amendment (proposed 1789). Prior to that, it was the 26th amendment in 1971.We've gone about 51 years since we ratified an amendment that was proposed in the same century.And it isn't Congress that amends the constitution. Congress and propose an amendment, but 3/4 of all states have to ratify it."
25-3,It's weird all the accounts arguing against this were made 16 or 17 days ago. Strange that.
25-3-1,"This happened in the Canadian subs in the 2021 federal election. In the months leading up to it, an insane amount of sudden anti-Trudeau sentiment swept through the subs, with most of the comments coming from accounts that were either brand new, or a year old with only a few other comments that were almost exclusively anti-vax or anti-covid.It's baffling that so much effort is put into astroturfing reddit of all places.. especially in regional subs that reach significantly less than 1% of the population.  Do they really expect turning the conversation in here to impact election results? What are they really accomplishing except making life hell for the mods?"
25-3-1-1,Astroturfing is cheap and extremely effective. It's not just happening on reddit - it's a comprehensive package of social media manipulation across all platforms.
25-3-1-1-1,"yeah i think we vastly underestimate how prolific it isevery now and then youll see the 'whats a great product worth the money' or similar threads make their way through the askreddit rotation and so much of it is so obviously astroturfed. youll see like 15 people comment HBO Max or Dawn dish soap ""Wow Dawn is so great at cutting the toughest stains im so glad i went with them and not ajax"" I'm like yeah your average redditor is really this passionate about dish soap let me tell ya"
25-3-1-1-1-1,"I've always seen this but honestly how does one go about finding a paid opportunity like this? Is it a secret, invite-only society? Not to mention it must have the most ironclad NDA possible because no one posts referral links to sign up.I always see comments about ""paid shills"" and stuff, but I've literally never seen how I can sign up to get paid for this shit.I'm not saying this doesn't happen, but if it's as prolific as it is, I feel like there's so little actual information available on how to become said astroturfer."
25-3-1-1-1-1-3,"Personally, I think part of it is AI. AI can't perfectly make a conversation, but for the purpose of Astroturfing it's good enough.&#x200B;It's a chill medium where we expect people to write like they talk. So grammar and spelling being off is no big deal.&#x200B;Then we all see stupid people who post inane nonsense online, so our expectations are lowered even further.&#x200B;Think of a decent chat bot, now imagine that instead of needing to carry on the conversation, it just has to make certain posts about certain topics, and it doesn't even need to fully make sense. Just be there and pretend to be human so a fringe position doesn't seem to fringe anymore.&#x200B;Then, since a lot of people buy it, there has to be some real merit to it right? So then real people start getting on board..."
25-3-1-3,"Best example is r/MurderedByAOC , which was a Russia-based bot net run by a single individual. It was shut down about a month ago and went silent for 3+ weeks before someone else started posting. But the new posts aren't explicitly anti-Ukraine and anti-Biden like the old ones were.It's still a single user posting, but prior to a month ago, r/MurderedByAOC was on the front page of reddit nearly every day with anti-Ukraine sentiment, whereas it's all but silent now, just as it was for the first couple weeks after Russia clamped down on social media. One the plus side, the new owner of that sub is at least posting some AOC-related content, as opposed to the stuff making r/all in the past, which almost never had any relevance to her."
25-3-1-3-1,I think the walkaway subreddit is another fantastic example of manufactured bullshit. I’m glad they finally cracked down on irlourpresident or whatever his name was but there’s still a lot of work to be done.
25-3-1-3-1-2,"Yup, that was the account running something like a dozen of those subs, which all went silent simultaneously immediately after the Russian invasion began on 2/24, and again a month ago."
25-3-1-4,"They do, that tactic worked great on Facebook and we’re the conduit to people too smart for that shit. These cons don’t know any better. Pay no attention to the age of my account"
25-3-2,"This is how things were in 2016 and 2020. They are trying to generate apathy so republicans have an easier time winning.The answer is voting and voting Democrat in every election. We wouldn't be here if democratic voters turned out like republican voters do.___________Edit: replies to this are largely positive and show a good shift from past years, but there is still an alarming number of people actively trying to get others to stay home.**Everyone needs to mobilize on here and shout over the republican actors trying to get people to stay home.**They are not interested in women's right, LGBTQ rights, minority rights or rights for the poor. They are only interested in themselves and feeling justified in their actions to stay home or advocating for the republicans.**See someone pushing apathetic rhetoric? Swoop in and put a stop to it.** Bury that rhetoric at every corner. This is how we win."
25-3-2-1,"But also remember, one person is just one vote.  We can all do more than that!   Make sure your friends are registered and feel the same level of urgency!  Volunteer for local campaigns in your area or donate, if you can!"
25-3-2-1-1,And since it’s a little late for local elections. Look up republicans that are running against no one. Get together with people in your community. Become a write in.
25-3-2-1-1-1,"Some states have not had their primaries yet. Judges, local issues and school board will be voted for on Aug 23 in FL for example. Get voting info here, register, check that your registration is current, update your address… www.vote411.org"
25-3-2-1-1-1-1,"And for the love of god, vote in your local and school board elections!  Having won the battle for the courts, this is the next place the fascists' are targeting.  And it's everywhere. Even in reliably blue New York, a number of nut jobs are taking over school boards in upstate to try and force NY down the Don't Say Words We Don't Like path."
25-3-2-1-2,Not in Wyoming - each vote is like 3 votes due to how EC works
25-3-2-1-2-1,Not for state/local elections. Which is where national candidates generally start.Want better candidates? Vote local.
25-3-2-1-3,"As a Democrat, I changed my voter registration to Republican so that I can vote in their primaries.  My goal is to mess up their polling data, but also vote for the craziest person who is least likely to win a statewide election."
25-3-2-1-3-1,"“But also vote for the craziest person who is least likely to win a statewide election.”Um…it seems like the “too crazy to be electable” people are winning statewide elections all the time post 2016. Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gatz, etc."
25-3-2-1-3-1-1,"Yeah, if the last 20ish years have taught us anything, it's that there is no 'too crazy' for the Republican party."
25-3-2-1-3-1-1-1,Agreed. Which makes OP’s plan a bad plan
25-3-2-1-3-4,"Yeah I’m the same, but NC has open primaries so I registered as Unaffiliated.  Unfortunately for us, it’s feeling like the more extreme wack-o is probably going to win in the Senate unless anything changes."
25-3-2-1-3-4-1,"Especially since the democrats refused to certify the green party candidate. If I'm a democrat in NC, I would refuse to vote to protest what the election board did to the green party. 100% undemocratic."
25-3-2-1-3-4-1-1,"The Green Party is a sham that gets pumped up by Republicans to steal votes from Democrat candidates.  Thus why Republicans are so against ranked choice voting because it would make that strategy irrelevant.Also should be considered, the Green Party in NC falsified signatures and petitions in order to try and get on the ballot.  So not exactly a competent or noble group."
25-3-2-1-3-4-1-2,"If you actually did that in NC, you would then be complaining later about being represented by some Qanon asswipe.  I’m glad you live somewhere else."
25-3-2-1-3-4-1-3,Jill Stein has entered the chat.
25-3-2-1-4,Our blue state went nearly all red across the board.
25-3-2-1-4-2,I’m assuming this is about Virginia?
25-3-2-1-4-2-1,Exactly.
25-3-2-3,They also create a false dichotomy- that you can't vote for Dems in the near term to protect essential rights while (at the same time) moving the party left on a number of progressive issues.It's possible to do both! Advocating for one does not hinder your ability to advocate for the other.It's a bad faith argument aimed to suppress votes.
25-3-2-5,"Here's the approach I've been using lately that seems to shut them up...If you honestly believe that giving dems a large enough majority to overcome republican obstructionism wouldn't result in any changes, let's put it to the test. Vote for a dem.If they win and do nothing, then you would actually have some facts to support what you're claiming. If they win and do make generational changes, then your life should be better off. Either way you win.You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain. So are you in? Or is your aim really just to discourage democratic voters as it appears to be?"
25-3-2-5-1,"I've argued with these people.  They'll just say ""but Democrats ALREADY control the Senate 51-50.  And yet they still haven't done all the things I want!"""
25-3-2-5-1-1,There's also Obama's super majority that he fucked up.
25-3-2-5-1-1-1,He had a supermajority for two months and we got the ACA out of it! Wish he'd had it for four years tbh. Let's give one to Biden
25-3-2-5-1-1-2,"A. They never had a super-majority under Obama. Last time the Dems had one was in Clinton's first term. Under Obama, their ""super-majority"" included the ""independent"" Joe Lieberman who campaigned for McCain as a keynote speaker at the 2008 republican national convention. That's the same Joe Lieberman who single-handedly killed the public option. Pretty hard to call that a super-majority.B. Even so, they still managed to pass the first major reform to healthcare in decades during that time despite massive opposition from heavily funded dark money.Imagine what they would have done with a dozen more Senators on their side."
25-3-3,"And just a few days ago these same accounts were arguing that Biden was doing nothing, had given up and was sleepwalking on abortion. Weird they aren't cheering now...."
25-3-3-1,The bots are back and they've taken over subreddits again. Like on r/latestagecapitalism is full of accounts commenting that voting is useless trying to generate apathy.
25-4,"Seems we need to protect privacy as the linchpin.Maybe I am missing something, but Roe fell due to a privacy based on the decision, no? Which then threatens many other rights. Perhaps we should start there to both protect our rights and restore the rights to abortions. This could also lead to expanding rights, rather than losing them."
25-4-2,"There isn't really anything the executive can do to restore a right that the SCOTUS has decided isn't Constitutionally support. The executive can only fill in the gaps, not restore rights."
25-5,Great news despite what the grumps here in r/politics believe. Anything that helps low income women that can’t travel to a different state is a PLUS
25-5-1,Outrage fatigue sometimes doesn't allow you to accept good news.
25-5-1-4,"Looking in your direction, Common Dreams “WhY wOn’T hE FiGhT fOr Us” crowd."
25-5-1-4-1,We can be happy that he's finally doing this and also wonder why the *fuck* it took him so long to do it.
25-5-1-4-1-1,lol *so long.*  I swear people think this is a videogame.
25-5-1-4-1-1-1,"""Why isn't Biden making an executive order already? I specifically requested it"""
25-5-1-4-1-1-1-1,"He literally said while he was campaigning that he would make it the law of the land, so when the draft from the SCOTUS leaked in May about them wanting to take access to abortion away he had 2 months to do something. What do you mean lmao"
25-5-1-4-1-2,What? It’s been two weeks.
25-5-1-4-1-2-2,The decision was leaked in May.
25-5-1-4-2,Stop attacking people who are scared and upset
25-5-1-4-2-1,"Sorry but in the adult world being ""upset"" isn't some broad defense for being irrational and destructive."
25-5-1-4-2-1-1,You’re still doing it. Do you not want us to win?
25-5-1-4-2-2,"People are actively trying to make the voting block apathetic so the rightwing can keep damaging our society.This isn't about ""attacking"" people, it's about pushing back against a misinformation campaign."
25-5-1-4-2-2-1,"Nah, it’s attacking people."
25-5-3,"It's a plus, but what worries me is that Biden will call this issue as out of his hands after this. This is not abortion action, this is contraception action."
25-5-3-1,"Well it kinda is, I mean he is extremely limited as to what he can do via executive order. What we really need is congressional action."
25-5-3-1-1,Remember when Joe Biden spent an entire year on the campaign trail telling us we HAD to vote for him because he was the only candidate in the field that could go to congress and whip up votes? And then every left leaning news outlet on earth repeated that bullshit lie and tanked candidates like Bernie.I certainly do and he has yet to do that even once.
25-5-3-1-1-2,"His administration has passed several bipartisan bills, including one on guns, which is nuts. But that must be difficult to see from inside the outrage machine you're currently operating."
25-5-5,"But how is it helping those women? Besides protecting access to the abortion pill, that doesn’t stop states from prosecuting doctors or imprisoning women. Or am I missing something?"
25-5-5-1,State governments are going to start looking through federal mail?EDIT: The order adds privacy protections for electoronic communications under the affordable care act via the article. So ideally state governments won’t know that someone got the abortion pill
25-5-5-1-1,Just because you can legally obtain the medicine doesn’t mean that abortion is then legal. So those women aren’t actually being protected from incarceration etc.
25-5-5-1-1-1,"It’s not , but this is what fighting looks like"
25-5-5-1-1-1-1,No fighting would look like declaring a state of emergency.
26,"President Biden: ""Investors in the banks will not be protected. They knowingly took a risk, and when the risk didn't pay off, investors lose their money. That's how capitalism works."""
26-1,"I don't always agree with Joe, but he's absolutely correct on this. No more corporate welfare."
26-1-1,"fuck yea, if they spent the billions on the little people instead of a broken wanker bank structure we would all have free houses and money.. but what happened? they pissed it away again"
26-1-1-1,"the worst part is that a lot of them expect to be reimbursed because they don't think they should be punished for making bad investments. and now they've lost all their money so someone should pay for that. and they should get their money back. wtf are they thinking, is there a casino where you can get your money back if you lose?"
26-1-1-1-1,"One month ago a coworker called me a moron for investing my money in treasury bonds instead of putting the money on the stock exchange because ""yeah they may be supersafe but its not very profitable"" were his words, I was literally wasting investing money and I wasnt being smart with it.You should see his face yesterday after the stock market opened... ""not funny, I lost a lot of money today"" were his words after I asked him how were his very smart investements doing with a grin on my face."
26-1-1-1-1-1,Wasn’t one of the problems with this bank being that they over leveraged in treasury bonds and eventually had to sell them off at a massive loss? Honest question.
26-1-1-1-1-1-1,"That, combined with no liquid assets. They were forced to sell at a loss because they had no actual money left"
26-1-1-1-1-1-3,"Yes; they had too much cash and nothing to do with it, so they put it all in treasuries. Which was fine when they had a healthy mix, but over the last year they had to sell off the short terms, leaving only the long terms. They needed to sell more but if they sold the long terms it would be at a massive discount.As a result the Fed is now allowing other banks to pledge their treasuries as collateral for loans of up to one year. The thinking is that this will prevent liquidity crises at other banks and give them time to adjust their portfolios."
26-1-1-1-1-2,"You reminded him that smart investors don't put money in the market they'll need within the next five years, as it's incredibly rare for investments to have a negative return over any given five year period?And also that many advisors recommend keeping your age in bonds, soon if you're 40 you'll have 40% in bonds, etc?After all, he's a smart guy, he should know that stuff, right?"
26-1-1-1-3,"It's not a casino, is investment, and they were promised they were going to be richer, and now they are less rich, and That's not fair because they always have all they want and they wanted a new yatch this summer and they will have to use the same yatch than last year and that's embarrasing..."
26-1-1-1-4,"Well they are thinking they spent millions of dollars ""lobbying"" in both the house and the Senate. And are now wondering what that lobbying money bought them."
26-1-1-1-4-1,exactly what their politicians said they would be getting. they will take all their money and give it all to the rich ppl so that a fraction of it will eventually trickle back down so that you will get a little bit of it back in the future after you've given them more money
26-1-1-1-5,"I'm pretty sure gambling losses are tax deductible, which if true, there sort of is lol."
26-1-1-2,We'd also have a robust middle class and companies wouldn't be complaining that nobody is shopping anymore lol
26-1-1-3,During the initial collapse in 2008 it was Iceland who bailed out the people and started investigations into those with financial wrongdoing. A secretary of the ministry of finance went to jail.
26-1-1-5,But but but.......won't somebody please think of the billionaires.
26-1-3,"Every now and then, old, angry, “get off my lawn, I don’t give a fuck” Joe Biden rears his head. And in those moments, I am happy.It’s like he suddenly remembers that this is his last job. Win or lose in 2024, that’s it for him. So fuck it, say what you’re thinking. You’ve been relatively well-tempered for 40+ years.If you wanna tell Lindsay Graham to suck your balls, do it."
26-1-3-1,And that's assuming he even wants 2024. Which he might not.
26-1-3-1-1,What annoys me is the Democrats haven’t even seemed to try and field a viable other option.
26-1-3-1-1-1,Publicly. There's always a chance Joe's working behind the scenes and they just haven't popped up. It's very early in the year after all.
26-1-3-1-1-1-2,Unfortunately the best people for the job would never get it.
26-1-4,Old Joe is a million times better than 80s and 90s Joe.
26-1-4-1,"A lot has changed since then, and I think he is smart enough to see how the world is going. Instead of digging in his heels and trying to keep things the same, he is evolving as a person and leader."
26-1-4-1-2,Which is what makes him a good one
26-1-4-1-2-1,He still has his moments of sucking aka preventing the rail road unions from being able to strike and allowing more drilling in Alaska.
26-1-4-1-2-1-1,"Even with those shitty things, he's still probably the most progressive president in several decades.I'm extremely happy with him overall"
26-1-4-2,"Fr, the stuff he said/did back then terrified me when he got elected. Pretty happy with this, though."
26-1-4-2-1,"Joe's old enough that he has absolutely nothing to gain for himself and has no need to angle for some sort of family legacy.  The biggest actual positive of an octogenarian president.  He may say some odd and off color things, but he walks the walk and is trying - and succeeding - at doing measurable good.  I voted for him, but expected him to just try and bring things back to the status quo without rocking the boat.  It's almost good that the Republicans tried to be so obstructionist again because it seemingly spurred him to give up on even trying to appease them."
26-1-4-2-1-1,"It started out as ridin with Biden, let's hope the dark Brandon phase lasts till the next election"
26-2,"The feeling you're having while reading this is schadenfreude, and it is oh, oh so sweet."
26-2-1,"I'm thinking that this will be used as precedent to avoid bailing out other, hopefully bigger, entities. I bet there is an economic benefit to the recycling of those corpses."
26-2-1-1,"Right? I mean worst case scenario the assets just get bought by investors who might know what they're doing, bailouts only protect the idiots who fucked it up in the first place"
26-2-1-1-1,Better case is the government scoops up assets and sells them to small businesses. Shatter corporate megaliths one at a time.
26-2-1-1-1-1,BUST THE TRUSTS

26-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,BERNIE OR TRUSTwait
26-2-1-1-1-2,"okay, but these assets are all loans to businesses (definitely) and consumers (maybe) of unknown quality. they aren’t assets like stonks or real estate or gold, just loans. just promissory notes on pieces of paper, except nowadays not even that.small lenders (small businesses) might be interested in buying high quality parts of the portfolio, loans that are current, not behind in payments, loans that are well collateralized, in case the payer has trouble paying, loans to entities with good cash flow. small businesses aren’t going to want to pay to take over risky loans, which SVB was known for."
26-2-1-1-1-2-1,"Aren't a significant proportion of those loans treasury bills and bonds? They may have taken a value hit with rising interest rates, but they're not necessarily risky investments."
26-2-1-1-2,"Seriously. I heard the reason the Silicon Valley Bank had to be taken over by the FDIC is because they put a ton of money into long term bonds when they were at 1.7%\~. That is so fucking stupid I can't even comprehend it. As a bank it is essential to have liquidity and a 1.7% rate would've had to have been after the fed already started hiking rates with the promises of many more.Essentially, unless you hold those bonds until maturation, you have to sell them for a loss because no one will want to buy those bonds when they can get ones at nearly double to triple the rate (current bond rates are 3.5% to almost 4.85% depending on length of maturation)"
26-2-1-1-2-1,Great point.So who's the CIO who made that decision and porque?
26-2-1-1-2-1-1,"Their Chief administrative officer was the CFO of Lehamn Brothers when they went bankrupt....I wish I could completely fuck up at work and just get hired elsewhere to do the same thing again...&#x200B;Edit.

He was with Lehman brothers back then, but currently he is with SVB securities which is seperate from the bank....Sorry for the confusion. My fault for believing the news...."

26-2-1-3,"Yes, and honestly it feels so good to hear a bank not immediately get backing like it used to for pulling shit like this. You can't privatize the profits and socialize the losses and call it capitalism"
26-2-2,"You say schadenfreude.  I say capitalism.Rare that it works out in a way that makes me happy, but here we are."
26-2-2-1,"It's almost like capitalism and democracy are huge, messy machines that require constant maintenance and careful control, but.. you know, work really well when we do.It's nice to see when it functions."
26-2-2-1-2,
26-2-3,Yep. Risk vs reward is how it should be. Privatisation of profits coupled with the socialisation of debt is just so wrong - it makes me happy to have this called out.
26-2-3-1,When was the last time we jailed a banker
26-3,"Lmao, that’s pretty great. People continue to underestimate Biden, myself included."
26-3-1,"When Limbaugh died and all of the idiots started screaming for the flag to be lowered to half staff, ai thought here we go. Another outrage fest. Biden's admin shut that shit down by announcing flags were to be lowered for the milestone in Covd victim deaths. Totally took the steam out of the outrage. It was beautiful."

26-3-1-2,"I had never heard this story but I did the research. Actually, I couldn't even find a single story that talked about it, but I found the two events you talked about, biden's response only 3 days later.And that's fucking brilliant.By this way, this was a fucking desantis stunt, of course. People weren't talking about him as much back then."
26-3-1-2-1,"That's what I thought when it happened. I remember thinking this is what it's like having experienced professionals in charge, but it was so much more elegant that even that."

26-3-3-1,"Oil drilling is an unfortunate decision but the right one. The geopolitical implications of that project are massive. It’s not going to drastically increase how much oil is burning in the world, but will change where it is from. I’m a stanch stanch green energy person, I really am."

26-4-2,"Over on r/conservative they were bitching about this whole situation but anytime someone pointed out “Trump was the one who deregulated this” they’d go “oh but deregulation good.”You don’t get to saying deregulation is better then bitch about consequences of deregulations. Either you think deregulation and the effects are bad, or you think deregulation and the effects are good.It’s a goddamn cognitive dissonance fiesta over there. “Oh no! Investors are going to lose money! Deregulation is bad!” “But trump did the deregulation.” “Deregulation is good!” “But investors are losing money.” “Deregulation is bad!”"
26-4-2-1,It's the same thing with gun control. They want zero regulations but offer zero solutions to the adverse effects of that. It's just an endless fucking loop.
26-4-2-1-1,"It's the same with everything.  Abortion is evil, unless they need one.  Welfare is bankrupting the country, unless it's for farmers and red states.When Bush signed the Patriot Act it was good because ""If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.""But when Obama took office, suddenly the Patriot act was bad.  And when Trump took office it was good again!  But now it's BAD!"
26-4-2-1-1-1,Republicans: “Save the unborn babies!”Anyone: “What about all these poor born babies?”Republicans: “Damned Liberal welfare queens having babies they can’t afford! Stop being poor!”

26-4-2-1-1-1-2,"That's because they don't care about the life of the child. They just want to punish women for having sex. That's why the only aspect they care about is making sure the woman carries to term, regardless of how viable the pregnancy is."
26-4-2-1-2,"> It's the same thing with gun control. They want zero regulations but offer zero solutions to the adverse effects of that.its been shown that conservatives the world over can see reason, but only when it impacts them specifically. the reason they offer 0 solutions is because they don't care."
26-4-2-1-2-1,It’s the party of apathy. Literally the most selfish people in the world who have zero ability to look beyond their own four walls.
26-4-2-1-2-1-1,"That's not true at all, everything they do and believe is predicated on controlling what happens outside their own four walls and completely ignoring their own crimes. They want control over school rooms, libraries, bathrooms, even your private bedroom, but god help you if you dare propose laws that would affect their freedumbs."
26-4-2-1-3,"The solution to gun violence is a bottom up war against poverty and ignorance. But that would mean helping brown people, so we can’t have that. Even the neoliberal democrats would rather disarm the working class than put food in their mouths and money in their pockets."
26-4-2-1-3-1,"That's a solution to the majority of violent crime, full stop. The solution to gun violence is gun control."
26-4-2-1-3-1-1,"Exactly, there's a million little factors that contribute to gun violence, but the main one is easy unfettered access to guns, and many states having no requirements on safe storage, waiting periods and mandatory licensing & background checks."
26-4-2-1-3-1-1-1,"It’s an American issue and not an Australian one. No American, except for fringe groups that make up less than 5% of Americans, want Australian style gun control. It will never happen. And why should it anyway? Only a liberal or a fascist wants a disarmed working class."
26-4-2-1-3-1-3,No American wants Australian style gun control. It’s part of our culture. Even the most dyed in the wool pacifist liberal wouldn’t go for hyper strict laws. It is an American issue and we will deal with it ourselves in a way that we we want to. It isn’t any business of yours.
26-4-2-1-3-1-3-3,Imagine being delusional enough to think you speak for all Americans and then understand this dude probably has like all the guns. This is what we are dealing with in America.

Just like what happened when libertarians made a town without any governance and it eventually fell to the bears because each person had a different “solution” for the issue and no one wanted to pay taxes to get it fixed.
26-4-2-3-1,"To be perfectly clear — “fell to the bears” is literal here, not a weird idiom."

26-4-4-1,"They think the USPS is a business that should be making money, for fuck sake. The word ""Service"" is ***right fucking there***!!! They're deluded being the point of reason."
26-4-4-2,I think more and more people are starting to realize that capitalism has only made it this far because of socialism. But the only people that got the benefits of it were the most wealthy people already.
26-4-4-2-1,I think capitalism is a damn amazing system for producing running shoes and dishwashers and video games.Applying that same system to healthcare and utilities and education is fucking dumb
26-4-4-2-1-2,"Running shoes...besides sweatshops there's an incentive to use marketing to cover up being cheap.Dishwashers promote a crappy soap delivery system that makes them ineffective.

27,Biden lambastes 'MAGA Republicans' in rare prime time attack just 2 months before the midterms: 'There is no place for political violence in America'
27-1,"This speech isn’t for the MAGAs, it’s for the rest of America. Don’t expect them to sit down and go quietly, it’s clearly not in their nature otherwise they will have done so by now. No, they will double down, and fight until their pathetic reality consumes them somehow. This speech is to awaken a unified consciousness amongst the rest of America, to prepare us for that reality when it inevitably arrives."
27-1-1,"He sure as hell was talking to me.He pretty much said it exactly the way it looks, frankly. And, I don't care what the MAGA crowd thinks about it. They are profoundly over-represented & have nothing of value to add, and as much because we've slept on them as they have rigged the system.The fact is, if the rest of us ALL pull our damned weight as citizens, this shit changes dramatically. I would even say the tide has already turned, most just don't know it yet.It's not that we aren't strong enough to deal with the MAGA's and the oligarchy pulling their chain, we are. It's ALL about pulling in the same damned direction and all at once.FFS, let's not wait for a fucking war to do the work.VOTE!!"
27-1-1-1,"Getting the apathetic and undecided and independent to vote in the swing states will ensure a Biden win; getting the enrolled Democrats and independents to vote in for the house and senate will secure a D congress and avoid gridlock. It's all down to votes. Not even just in safe states or swing states but around the whole country.MAGA isn't going to change. They're gone. They would had left after Trump's numerous scandals. It ain't for them. They're just a quarter of the EV. The Dems are the other quarter. It's that 40, 50, 60% of grown Americans who don't vote, those are the ones who hold the future of this country in their hands."
27-1-1-1-1,Which is terrifying.
27-1-1-1-1-1,"FYI. We have 70% of all eligible Americans registered to vote. We had 60% of all registered voters participating in 2020 - up from 2016 and 2012.We still have a ways to go, but Americans *are* paying attention and voting.The real problem is our participation is uneven across the country. Some very high participation areas are hiding some very low participation areas."
27-1-2,Even Palin said she won’t give up and will “reload”. They’re Christo-fascists… they believe their cause is divine. They never give up ever.
27-1-3,"I was reading some comments on YouTube because I missed the live speech and some people are really in the deep MAGA end, saying this speech was causing more division and asking for a civil war while Trump is the best thing ever. It’s ridiculously tone deaf that’s what they heard from this speech, but also makes me feel this is more outside interference with other countries trying to sow discord and hate."
27-1-3-1,Those are paid trolls from the Republican Party and Russia. Ignore them.
27-1-4,Shame it wasn't broadcast on any major networks so it missed likely tens of millions of ears that need to hear it and would of benefited from it.
27-1-4-1,You’d think the media networks would be the most pro-democracy since they’ll be target number 1 when the right wingers take over.Guess short term profit trumps all
27-1-4-1-1,"Nah, the mainstream media loves trump. There was [an article] from last year by a journalist saying that they missed trump. An absolutely shameless article, I’m shocked that it was ever published because if I was that journalist Id never admit to that. Their profits skyrocketed during the trump years, and now the news from the White House doesn’t generate headlines as much anymore. That’s why they are doing their hardest to create a horse race by desperately clinging onto whatever they can to be relevant. Whether it’s Dems in disarray stories or doom and gloom predictions about elections, they thrive on this shit. Mainstream journalism is fundamentally broken."
27-2,"“There is no place for political violence in America. None,” President Joe Biden“History tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and the willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy,” President Joe Biden""You can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They're incompatible,” President Joe Biden“There are public figures all but calling for mass violence in the streets. This is inflammatory. It's dangerous. It's against the rule of law. And “We The People” must say: This is not who we are,” President Joe Biden“You can't love your country only when you win,” President Joe Biden""Democracy will be preserved in “We The People's” habits of the heart,” President Joe Biden""The #bidenspeech was just divisive, rude name-calling.""—Christians who bought their children ""Fuck Joe Biden"" t-shirts"
27-2-2,I live in Philly and there’re always bunch of school kids on their field trip here. One time there was obviously a group from a Christian school and I saw a kid wearing a tshirt that says “let’s go Brandon” and it was just so sad and disgusting
27-2-2-1,"And they think they're ""owning the libs"" instead of realizing how amazing it is to live a country where they ""have the right to be outrageous"" (as Biden said about bullhorn guy last night).That's the country they're actively trying to take down. It reminds of the quote about the Holocaust about not saying anything when they come for different groups (Jews, homosexuals, etc.) and then when they come for you there's no one else left to defend you. Because inevitably in an autocratic fascist state, the inner circle will continue to shrink and you'll eventually be on the wrong side. But sure, right now it's more important to ""own the libs"" than protect and secure our democracy."
27-2-4,Biden hasn’t ever been more right.
27-2-4-1,Biden sure came off as a fascist. He's got a new nickname Pedo Hitler.
27-2-4-1-1,"No, fascism is trying to overthrow democracy because you didn’t like the outcome. It’s not urging people to be better and vote better because the fascists literally raided the capitol building trying to overthrow the legitimate government.Defending democracy is not fascism. Attacking it to establish a populist is."
27-2-4-1-1-1,So your saying that rigging an election with 81 million fraudulent votes because you don't like the outcome of the election is fascist...... Well I will definitely agree with you. Pedo Hitler AKA Joe Biden needs to go
27-2-4-1-1-1-1,"81 million fraudulent votes?  You really are a piece of work. 81 million? You literally believe that essentially every fucking vote for Biden was fraudulent? I voted for Biden, so they cannot al be fraudulent. (I never voted for a single democrat pre-Trump, but he was such a sack of shit I voted straight dem in 2020 down the ballot.) You are EXACTLY the reason Biden is saying this. You’ve let yourself become deluded so badly that you personally are a threat to democracy. Good night, and get some help. You really need it."
27-2-5,"I live on the intracoastal waterway and all day people come by on boats (burning that high dollar gas joe biden caused lol) with ""FUCK JOE BIDEN"" flags. What horrible people."

27-3-1,"In his folly, the heckler only increased Dark Brandon’s power. Dark Brandon feeds on malarkey"
27-3-1-1,Honestly it really drove home his point about how batshit crazy detached from reality they are. At one point he even pointed it out.
27-3-1-1-1,"Has much *really* changed?Obama protestor: Jesus is lordObama: I knowObama protestor: Jesus is Lord!Obama: I-I know, I agree, I knowObama protestor: YOU ARE THE ANTICHRISTObama:  :/"

27-3-1-1-1-1-2,With that statement McCain delayed the magas for a full 8 years
27-3-1-1-2,They really are detached it's sad. Someone needs to call them on all the bs
27-3-1-1-2-2,That was the whole point of the speech…
27-3-2,They are just proving his point.
27-3-2-1,They don't see that though.
27-4,Lots of Trump folks are telling on themselves by being big mad at the President saying there’s no place for political violence and that democracy is good.
27-4-3,"Lots of Trump folks are saying ""I need to feel angry about this so...red background bad?!?""Seriously. Go check out that other sub."
27-5,"when he said that the protestor with the bullhorn had every right to be protesting because this is America, it felt like a great synergy moment. a very honest moment of talk and action"
27-5-1,"Yeah, that was great. A perfect counterpoint to Trump telling his people to beat up a guy protesting at one of his rallies.Biden is talking the talk, and proving that he can walk the walk of protecting people's freedoms, including and especially the right to free speech. Even when that speech is against him.That's what this country is about, that's the sort of thing we need to keep fighting for."
27-5-1-1,Show me one time he protected peoples freedoms
27-5-1-2,"And Biden said he'd like to take trump behind the gym and beat him up. Don't suck his Johnson like he's some savior of the U.S. Biden is crass, corrupt, and he's pushing a divisive narrative."
27-5-1-2-1,"Lol. You’re going to get downvoted here and here’s why: you left out the context of Biden’s quote. When you do that, you look like you’re debating in bad faith.Just for context here, Biden said your quote in response to Trump’s “grab them by the…” quote and if he’d like to debate Trump. Given the context here, Biden’s quote was essentially saying you don’t debate someone who condones sexual assault."
27-5-1-2-1-1,"I'm gonna get down voted here because this is cult like behavior you're exhibiting to say that the biggest threat to democracy is maga republicans, when at the same time we have a border that's non-functional, a corrupt FBI, discrimination in our schools against Catholics and conservatives, and an unfit president who has a difficult time stringing two sentences together unless his body is filled with 90% clarity enhancing drugs.But if I point out that truth to the cult I get lambasted for it."
27-5-1-2-1-1-3,Can you show me the discrimination against Catholics in schools that you're talking about?The only time we talked about it when I was in school was when it was directly relevant in historical senses
27-5-1-2-1-1-3-1,
27-5-2,I loved that moment! I couldn't hear what the bullhorn dude was saying
27-5-2-1,Something something Brandon.
28,"Biden's speech worked: Nearly 6 in 10 Americans agree MAGA is a threat to democracy. Despite warnings Biden's speech would backfire, it's had a galvanizing effect — and it's helping wake people up"
28-1,I feel like it’s always been 6/10… it’s the unwavering 35-40% that we need to worry about
28-1-1,Agreed.Every poll has the same ratio and it's been that way since Trump was in office.
28-1-1-1,"I can't help feeling like if that number was even 5-10% lower than it is, we wouldn't be in this mess."
28-1-1-1-1,"Maybe with the document scandal, it'll lower .. But this is no longer a rational group"
28-1-1-1-1-1,"I would say unlikely. The people on Trump's side at this point aren't going to flip on him. They aren't the type to allow themselves to admit they hitched their wagon to the wrong guy. To realize they were wrong, and he was wrong, well, that's just something they are not capable of doing."
28-1-1-1-1-1-1,"It’s not about flipping Trump voters tho, it’s about getting everyone else together and at the polls to stop him and his shit squad!"
28-1-1-1-1-1-1-4,> shit squad!This is so funny
28-1-1-1-1-1-2,"I dunno, I've seen some Trump banners come down, so there's some hope. But I'm in the northeast..."
28-1-1-1-1-1-2-4,"I’m live in deep red trump country in the south.My neighbors Trump flag came down on January 7th or 8th.My in laws neighbor, a gung ho military type, had a giant trump flag. It came down after the Mar a Lago raid.It’s happening.He’s tanking. His support among independents is cratering by the day."
28-1-1-1-1-1-3,"Yeah, but eventually they gotta die out. Don't quote me on this, but I read that roughly 8,000 boomers die every day and 11,000 gen z's become eligible to vote. I don't know if those are accurate numbers, but eventually the older voters that are his bread and butter gotta go."
28-1-1-1-1-1-3-1,I’ve been reading stats like this for 30 years. It’s a ubiquitous folly to convince leftists they don’t need to vote.
28-1-1-1-1-3,"Sorry, but if literally attempting to violently overthrow a democratic election didn’t work, a few sensitive pieces of paper aren’t doing the trick either."
28-1-1-1-1-4,Go watch a bunch of maga terrorist TikTok’s. Then go watch all their live streams. Those people won’t budge.
28-1-1-1-2,"Fox News, and the entire conservative *state* media propaganda machine, has spent the last 50 years cultivating that 35-40% of unwavering support for fascism."
28-1-1-1-2-2,Fascism only occurs in a situations where the government has full control. Conservatives are pro smaller government that's governed at the state level. If you do any research you will see Liberals are the party that supports facism.
28-1-1-1-2-3,"I dunno, NPR is literally state supported media and it leans left. The state tends to hate conservatives, because it's mostly made up of liberals"
28-1-1-1-2-3-4,The state tends to hate conservatives because they are a whiney intolerable bunch who want things their way or the highway.
28-1-1-1-2-3-4-1,"They're definitely obstructionist but they literally are called conservative... They're not trying to change society, they're trying to maintain the status quo."
28-1-1-1-3,"I'd wager even if the number is ""only"" 5-10% that'll already be too high."
28-1-1-3,"It's almost like there's a good 30-40% of people that lack some serious critical thinking skills, and they've all been duped. It's not even necessarily their fault, either. Their education didn't provide it to them because the system was designed that way. Their environment was fairly homogeneous, their life experiences kept pretty local and limited...it's easier to manipulate those that haven't been truly exposed to the reality of the rest of the world. I just don't see it changing unless we can come up with a way to bring the world closer together."
28-1-2,"I think there's a lot of people that don't like Trump/MAGA but are also afraid of being alarmists. If 6/10 are willing to go so far as to say MAGA is a threat to democracy, I'd say that's progress."
28-1-2-1,"It’s crazy how 4/10 people are so hardline they refuse to reject extremism within their own party.Are 4/10 people MAGA supporters? Absolutely not. Are 4/10 people so hell bent on conservative values, Christian fundamentalism, single issue voting and/or pro-business to the point they’d tolerate the absolute worse their party is capable of? Unfortunately."
28-1-2-1-3,"Maybe clarify MAGA supporter. I don't think the average Trump voter is extreme, and I am not a registered Republican."
28-1-3,"If Trump selling nuclear secrets to hostile foreign powers doesn't sway them, nothing will."
28-1-4,The problem is only half of the 6/10 vote but 100% of the 4/10 vote
28-1-4-1,"Every time you see someone arguing that voting doesn’t matter, you need to attack them furiously and unrelentingly, because that attitude is why the GOP keeps winning"
28-1-4-1-1,"The answer to ""voting doesn't matter"" is, ""so why do right wing politicians go to so much trouble to make it hard to vote?"""
28-1-4-1-3,* Unless they’re Republican.  I’ve a couple friends who support Trump.  Both of them didn’t bother voting because they don’t believe voting matters. I totally agreed with them & then voted for Biden ;)
28-1-4-1-4,> that attitude is why the GOP keeps winningI mean Trump won despite getting fewer votes but go ahead and furiously attack people who noticed that voting didn't matter
28-1-4-1-4-1,"> I mean Trump won despite getting fewer votes but go ahead and furiously attack people who noticed that voting didn't matter""As a progressive, I just want to say that we should all stop voting and lay down to die! That'll solve everything!"""
28-1-4-1-4-2,"Trump won by 70,000 votes to win the electoral. 6 million people that voted in 2012 didn’t vote in 2016.6 fucking million. Many polled after said they thought Hillary was such a lock they didn’t bother voting.Voting matters a LOT, and it’s corporate and Republican propaganda that gets people to think it doesn’t.70,000 votes. That’s the difference in the supremes court being stacked, the next few decades of judicial policy being set, and a host of other impacts to Americans lives."
28-1-4-1-4-3,"I mean, that just reinforces the need for everyone to vote."
28-1-4-1-4-3-1,"Sure but it doesn't mean that the reason the GOP is winning is because people aren't voting.  The majority of people are voting against the GOP and the GOP is still winning. The reason why they are winning is because the deck is stacked, not because people acknowledge the deck is stacked"
28-1-4-1-5,on a national scale voting statistically does not matterhell our president isnt even directly elected. the more local the race is the more your vote matters
28-1-5,Right. 6 in 10 isn’t a solid lead
28-1-5-1,6 in 10 thinking maga is a threat isn't bad as long as a good chunk of the remaining 4 is voting against it regardless.
28-2,We could tell it was going to work when the Republicans and right-wing media started attacking the speech even before Biden had given it.They knew that they needed to inoculate the softer parts of their base (the non-MAGA Republicans) because otherwise Biden was going to peel them away for the midterm the same way he did in the presidential election.
28-2-1,"Honestly, I could have told you before that.The left has been desperate for a fighter to stand up for human rights and rule of law.  I’m not sure if Biden is that fighter but I’ll take what I can get."
28-2-1-2,">I’m not sure if Biden is that fighter but I’ll take what I can get.*""I'm Joe Biden and you can bet your sweet patootie I approve this message!""*"
28-2-1-2-1,"He seems more of a ""bet your behind"" kind of guy.""Sweet patootie"" just gives me Sarah Palin vibes."
28-2-1-2-1-1,Fair.
28-2-1-3,"A reminder that Trump is so pathetic that Joe Biden could beat him from his basement.Why Republicans insist on clinging to Trump's bloated political corpse is beyond me, but I am glad that they will continue to pay for it."
28-2-1-3-1,Because they don't actually know how to stay in touch with their voters.  They think that by praising Trump they'll convince his voters to vote for them too.
28-2-1-3-1-1,Riding those ~~coat~~bloattails.
28-2-1-3-1-1-1,Trump is Putin’s Weekend At Bernie’s.
28-2-1-3-1-1-1-4,Chucke
28-2-1-3-1-1-2,Riding those ~~coat~~~~bloat~~culttails
28-2-1-3-1-3,"Yup. The right has been bleeding voters for years, but Trump was able to motivate a lot of people who otherwise typically do not vote, or remain unmotivated by the GOP's constant press to lower taxes but share absolutely none of the profits. They are dead in the water even *with* Trump's base locked up, so they have to play his game and continue to drain their coffers and feed his fat ass. They don't know how to jettison him but keep his base (probably because there isn't a way to maintain his most rabid supporters without setting up an even more racist, authoritarian candidate who would likely turn off even more independents), so they're stuck being dragged down with his bloated corpse."
28-2-1-3-1-3-3,This makes me smile & feel a glimmer of hope :)
28-2-1-3-1-4,What so you expect them to do? Promote policies that their voters want?
28-2-1-3-2,"Because Russia gave Trump all the intel on them so they gotta kiss the ring. [Remember, when the DNC was hacked, so was the RNC, but only one set of emails were released.] The GOP has plenty of skeletons in their closets and Trump has the key."
28-2-1-3-2-1,"This is the real answer.From way back in 2016, [U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack]:>	U.S. intelligence officials now believe with ""a high level of confidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, senior U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.>	Two senior officials with direct access to the information say **new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from Democrats was leaked and otherwise used**. The intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.Emphasis mine."
28-2-1-3-2-1-2,Crazy how deep Putin wormed his way into the American political system
28-2-1-3-2-2,What I still don’t get is why all these politicians insist on sharing their dirty secrets over email. How fucking dumb do you have to be?To: local judgeSubject: Last weekend I accidentally killed a hookerCc: RNC; Rick Scott; Lindsay GrahamMessage:can you help me out?
28-2-1-3-2-2-1,"They are ancient and have no idea how technology works. [Just watch them ask the CEO of google about iphones.]. I wannabe happy they don't understand tech because in a better world, they would be held accountable for the horrible shit they do and leaving a tech paper trail would be exhibit A, but in this world it just leaves us open to hackers while they get blackmailed. [At least Manafort got fucked because he didn't know how to convert a pdf to a word document.]"
28-2-1-3-2-2-2,"Some of it is undoubtedly that blunt. But a whole ton of things that couldn't be definitively proven probably could be if the emails were released. I also imagine Republicans probably don't speak about republican voters, minorities, women, or really anyone other than themselves in a kind way when they believe they're communicating privately."
28-2-1-3-2-3,What I don't understand is why do they think republican voters would care? The voters don't care that trump is the seven deadly sins given form so why should they care about other members of the GOP?
28-2-1-3-2-3-1,"When Madison Cawthorne went on a podcast and said that the Republicans were hosting coke-fueled orgies and he'd been invited to one, everyone thought he was obviously lying for attention. Until someone began releasing a mountain of kompromat on him less than a week later-- photos of him in lingerie, photos of him humping another man. It ended up costing him his primary election.I know this sounds totally fucking batshit, like something out of some trashy 80s B movie or a rejected QAnon plotline. But unfortunately for all of us, [it's fucking real]."
28-2-1-3-2-4,[07/04/2018]
28-2-1-3-3,"The republicans have nothing to offer outside of trump.Once he eventually dies of old age, I know people talk about desantis and I truly think he’s frightening, it’s hard to imagine that the people that absurdly think trump is charismatic being replaced by him.All the republicans have is hate for the “other” and trump brought that to full force. I don’t see how they ever become a party with actual policies again. The base is too hate motivated and only cares about non political correctness and money and “fighting for the little guy” or something. I don’t see how anyone ever replaces trump once he’s out of the picture"
28-2-1-3-5,"It’s one of the reasons why Trump and the neckbeards were convinced it was fraud. There’s no way a candidate with as many “flaws” as Biden allegedly had, prone to so many gaffes, could beat Trump so soundly by doing next to nothing in his basement.A candidate so perfect as Trump couldn’t possibly have lost. Had to be fraud."
28-2-1-4,Hes stepped up and it's time we back him for it.None of these half measures or I guess I'll take it shit.Biden wasn't my top pick but I'll be goddamned if I'm not donating and campaigning for him.
28-2-1-5,"He isn’t the fighter we want, but he’s the fighter we need. He’s made plenty of mistakes, but he’s learned from them and he’s trying to atone. He’s the most relatable president probably ever."
28-2-2,"For me or was the fact that the GOP attacked the red background as nazi like, rather than attacking anything Biden said.It was a very red background, but also a national monument. But the GOP critics had nothing to say about the speech. Only that red states should hate red backgrounds."
28-2-2-1,"Also the red background is from a very zoomed in picture, cutting off that there was red white and blue in the background"
28-2-2-1-1,"Also, even if it were just pure red lighting, I fail to see how that would even come remotely close to the trial-by-combat bullshit trump and his sycophants were (and still are really) spouting."
28-2-3,He needs to fire everyone who told him it was going to backfire. They’re the reason the Democratic Party loses so goddamn often.
28-2-3-2,"It's wild to see moderates/centrists praise or request watered down attributes of Sanders just because Biden does it instead.Progressives continually said we need someone that will fight for the common person, that we need someone that will throw aside tradition to protect our rights (like reforming the Supreme Court to protect Roe v Wade), that we need legislation that gives people hope via progressive(ish) legislation, that we need to bring nonvoters back into the fold (which is how Biden won GA and AZ), etc...I'm not sure why so many people want to drag their feet on drastic issues that have been decades in the making."
28-2-3-2-1,It’s because big Democratic donors are centrists (actually center-right).
28-2-3-2-1-1,Ding ding ding!Liberals aren’t progressive or left leaning at all. They parrot progressive talking points to get votes and then they vote for their corporate overlords.Liberals are corporate centrists at the best.
28-2-3-2-2,Because they are still operating on blind fucking faith in the inherent goodness in people.And refusing to accept that we know for a flat fucking FACT that at any given time 30 percent of any given country would kill the rest in support of a Trump-like figure. That's just how many humans are broken fucking garbage.And we're where we are because we're under the mistaken assumption garbage is competent enough to be trusted with power.
28-2-4,">We could tell it was going to work when the Republicans and right-wing media started attacking the speechWhen were they attacking the speech? I must have missed it, since I only noticed them attacking their made up, dumbass conspiracies concerning the speech."
28-2-4-1,"[Tucker Carlson: Biden will use his speech to push for partisan advantage ahead of the midterms]Of course they all parrot the same talking points, so OAN, Newsmax, etc had similar stories."
28-2-4-1-3,Don’t forget Jimmy Dore is attacking it too. That’s how you know it’s working.
28-2-4-1-3-1,"That clown Dore probably has a picture of Trump tattooed on his ass.lol.He is a phony ""liberal""  that panders to the MAGA cult."
28-3,"Shockingly authority cracking down on fascism has a hugely chilling effect on fascist given how mob dynamics work.  People are less ridiculous when they perceive there are real world consequences for their actions.  Many are just evil because they think they can get away with it, which is why trump and his associates flaunt the law and make no apologies. It makes them appear strong and above the law.  This let's their supporters hide their own weakness."
28-3-1,"I use local town Facebook forums for advertising my business. I live in a blue metro area with a lot of small towns all packed together. I find it hilarious how every single town forum has a ""[town] uncensored"" or ""true [town]"" version as well. This version is usually about 1/10th the size, full-on MAGA and consists mostly of individuals banned from the mainline one. These people really think they're the Main Character.Edit: Just want to add, I don't even bother advertising on these versions. Not that I won't take MAGA money, it's green too. But these people are usually the ULTIMATE, FINAL BOSS LEVEL 99 Karens. The only reference to local businesses on these forums is usually to absolutely slam them for dumb shit. Like this morning, someone was complaining that a bagel shop was busy on a Saturday morning and had a line  Yeah, I'd rather not have these customers anyway."
28-3-1-1,We have the same type of groups here in Canada for the rednecks who love flying the southern flag. You know..as they live in the farthest north you can pretty much get..
28-3-1-3,">But these people are usually the ULTIMATE, FINAL BOSS LEVEL 99 Karens.Good call not wanting to deal with them. They're the 10% of your customers that will cause 80% of your headaches."
28-4,Keep sharing it.  Most don’t even take the time to watch.  It’s a very powerful speech and long overdue.
28-4-1,"This. Repetition is a key to driving home a message. It’s advertising and media 101. Biden also needs to KEEP saying these things, and other Democrats need to join in and amplify. Voters need to hear it until they can recite the best parts verbatim, just like a good ad campaign."
28-4-1-1,"Exactly right. The radical right repeat their talking points over and over to the point where even people who don’t watch their media know them. It’s ubiquitous — day after day, week after week."
28-4-1-1-1,Like how they all hate Fauci but not a single one can give a single actual reason
28-4-1-1-1-1,"I can.  He is a socialist, a communist, a scientist, a liberal, and any other words that have lost their  meaning or become a slur used by Republicans who have no clue about what intelligent people actually discuss."
28-4-2,"Ok, but like...Do you have a link? I haven't seen it."
28-4-2-1,C-SPAN video:White House Transcript:
28-4-2-1-1,Holy shit the comments on that video are so disheartening...
28-4-2-1-3,"Holy shit that was good.It was okay up to about 11 minutes then really popped off. Loved hearing the protesters blaring alarms outside and his response was quickly, “it’s okay, that’s their right in a democracy, good manners is something they’ve never suffered from…” and moved on.Much different than “somebody oughta knock him in the head”"
28-4-2-3,On your side here. I need a link.
28-4-5,Well written but not powerfully delivered or impactful. Old man yells at clouds
28-4-5-1,"Disagree.  He shouldn’t talk like a dictator.  Powerful has many faces.  Dominant or control is the opposite of true power.   He has poise, respect, intelligence and agility in his delivery.  I think there are many people and policies that I can complain about with gov and the Biden administration.  But President Biden has not been one of them.  I believe he genuinely is trying to do what is best for people and not profit.  But I could be wrong; I’ve been wrong about people before."
28-5,"Some people are just ignorant to what's going on in the political world.  I was.  And I was happier for it.Trump botched things so badly that I had to wake up and get clued in.  I'm still mad at him for that, as I can never go back to blissful ignorance.Many people need to be similarly awakened."
28-5-1,"it's part of why they are putting so much effort into making ""woke"" into an insult.because when you do become politically and socially aware of the injustices that our system has in place... it gets a whole lot harder to manipulate people against their own interests."
28-5-1-1,The fact that they think being awake and aware is a bad thing really says something about their ideology.
28-5-1-1-1,"Or like ""antifa"" is supposed to be a bad thing... Facism bad, democracy good. Minimal effort to figure that one out lol"
28-5-1-1-1-2,"That's why they deliberately pronounce it ""an-TEEfuh"" to disguise the fact that it literally means ""anti-fascism"""
28-5-1-1-1-2-1,"Which is why we should say ""anti fascist protesters"" when speaking to right wingers. The shortened name aids their cognitive dissonance."
28-5-1-1-4,It’s an attack on The Enlightenment period. The period that America’s founding fathers used to create the nation. Odd? Yes 
28-5-1-1-5,"It's not that, they think ""wokeness"" is fake awakening.  they have their own terms like ""red pilled""."
28-5-2,Man i wish i could go back to not caring what goes on in politics. It was so much easier back then.
28-5-2-1,"Dement people not caring about politics is what caused this Jess, so maybe don't return to that?"
28-5-2-1-2,There wont ever be a time where i dont care about politics again. I always sortof kept up with it and always voted. But now i pay way more attention.
28-5-3,It’s the same for me. In a way I miss my ignorance and apathy because I was happier too. But I’m not going back to it. I’ve never voted in any elections except presidential ones. That changes this year. As long as I live I’m never going to miss any elections no matter how small because I’ve found out they’re all important. I will never vote Republican. It’s become the insanity party.
28-5-3-3,How has it become the insanity party? You really think the Biden Administration and democrats are looking out for the average middle class American?
28-5-3-3-1,"One party backed and still backs a failed violent attempted coup fomented by the former president from their party in an attempt to stay in power beyond his term.The other isn't.Only one of these options is good for an America with ""liberty and justice *for all*""."
28-5-3-3-1-1,"So Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and other prominent democrats egging on violence, out right calling for violence during the BLM riots that destroyed cities and small businesses for 7 months straight and killed 30 people isn’t that bad?"
28-5-3-3-3,One party doesn't try to disprove climate change by bringing in a snowball for show and tell.
29,"Biden predicts that if Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, same-sex marriage will be next"
29-1,We had that idiot Kim Davis here in Kentucky deny a gay couple a marriage certificate because gay marriage would ruin the sanctity of her 4 marriages.
29-1-1,And mike huckabee was right there beside her.
29-1-1-1,And Josh Duggar.The Huckabees are not good judges of character. Remind them if you live in Arkansas.
29-1-1-1-1,I’ve lived in KY and NWA - I get it.
29-1-1-1-1-1,People outside of NWA don’t know what NWA is.
33,"Biden is once again pushing to give all US workers paid parental leave— and he wants their kids to have free universal preschool, too"
33-1,GOP: protect the kids!Biden: And their parents! And give kids a good foundational level of education!GOP: not like that.
33-1-1,The GOP knows that fighting imaginary enemies is a heck of a lot cheaper than providing for basic needs.
33-1-1-1,"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.LBJ"
33-1-1-1-1,"Yep, there was a lad from Northern Ireland, Gustie Spence, started the wave of British violence against the irish minority in N that caused the Troubles. But once they were over he did a lot of thinking, and he realised when push came to shove both communities were just working class people, and his community’s hatred for the natives was just to keep them divided. If you look into NI’s history before the troubles you’d find it was basically an oligarchy.I say this for two reasons, one because it’s how these bastards always work, be they yanks or limeys, two, because NI is what happens when you let folks like the GOP win"
37,"Trump Calls Biden 'Enemy of the State' in 'Fully Unhinged' Speech. ""This is, quite simply, a speech intended to incite domestic terrorists to kill FBI agents and members of the Biden administration,"" said one attorney."
37-2,Biden: some of these MAGA people sound like fascistsFascists: THE PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE STATE
37-2-2,>~~Fascists~~ Republicans: THE PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE STATE
37-2-2-1,What's the difference?
37-2-2-1-1,"What Republicans stand for: Nothing there.What Republicans understanding of the word fascism: Nothing there.You're right,  no difference."
37-2-2-1-1-1,"Hmm... Isn't it the other way around? Fascists, however misguided they were, actually stood for something. The MAGA lot just runs towards whatever dog whistle the party uses to control them. They are actually worse than fascists, IMHO. Mindless, soul-crushing zombies.Edit: it's hilarious that they think they are so justified in their rage that it's reasonable to kill innocent people. This is the Nazi part of the current century. Let's not fool anyone."
37-2-2-1-1-1-3,"Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, at least it’s an ethos"
37-2-2-1-1-1-3-3,"Excrement is excrement. I'm not denying that. I'm saying these aren't even that, these are the maggots that feed on it. Literally recycling Nazi propaganda to further their goals."
37-2-2-1-3,"Not every Republican is a fascist, but every fascist is a Republican"
37-2-2-1-3-2,"Nah, there's a lot of devout active fascists (as opposed to ones who just go along with the insanity without any thought) that think the GOP aren't far right enough. There are actual far far far right parties in the US, though quite small and spread out."
37-2-2-1-3-2-1,"You can always find an outlier, but he is mostly right."
37-2-3,As if any of them even recognize Biden is the president...
37-2-4,Regardless of whether Biden is an “enemy”. He’s the leader of the State. How can he be an enemy of it? Doesn’t even make sense!
37-2-4-1,"IMO, it *totally makes sense* for Trump to think that a sitting President could be an enemy of the State. He knows from experience."
37-3,"Democrats:  call fascists fascists.Republicans: Ok, well I’ll do political violence if you’re going to call me fascist."
37-3-1,"""Ok, well I'll do EVEN MORE political violence""FYFY."

37-3-1-1-1,What does that mean?
37-3-1-1-1-1,"A reference to The Office, a line which became a meme."

37-4-2,Meanwhile Republicans got their fefes hurt because Biden accurately diagnosed Trump MAGA people as a present and persistent threat to Democracy in the United States
37-4-2-1,I wonder how long before they try to make Fascist a protected class like races and genders. Such terrible discrimination the fash face
37-4-2-1-1,He/him/heil
37-4-2-1-1-1,Angry upvote…
37-4-2-1-1-1-1,That shit is hilarious. Whaddya mean angry upvote?!
37-4-2-1-1-1-1-1,It is hilarious. But it is too real. I went to the fair yesterday and saw a lot of MAGA hats and “Fuck Biden and everyone who voted for him” shirts. There were multiple people selling Trump 2024 flags. The fascists have been thoroughly brainwashed and are way too loud and proud. It’s scary how much of the population wants to destroy democracy as we know it.
37-4-2-1-2,"They've already done so with ""republican"". I've seen this online and in person."
37-4-2-1-2-1,"Republican's aren't a protected class, and they won't want to make political party a protected class then because then gerrymandering based on political party becomes illegal and they lose all their power."
37-4-2-3,Republicans have to acknowledge the divide in their party instead of insanely projecting it's a divide of the country.
37-4-2-4,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Biden referred to the MAGA crowd as a ""clear and present danger"".That is very specific language with legal implications."
37-4-2-4-1,"It is.  And it is correctly used.  When my local MAGAnuts are telling me they are going to ship me off to a camp or drag me out behind the barn for execution when the time is right, I interpret that as a ""threat to safety.""When the MAGAnuts stormed the Capitol, it was a ""risk to public interests that is serious and imminent.""You sure this is the path you want to go down?  Trump called Biden an ""enemy of the state"" which also has legal implications.  The difference is that Trump, as usual, has zero evidence because he pulls this shit out of his ample corpulent ass."
37-4-2-4-1-2,"I absolutely want President Biden and DOJ to go down that path.If MAGA and it's leaders can be legally tagged as a clear and present danger to the US government, that opens a lot of options to deal with them."
37-4-2-4-1-3,You need to contact local fbi office if you have been tthreatened
37-4-2-4-1-4,He has no political office so his exclamations carry no legal weight.
37-4-2-4-1-4-2,"I don't think that's true.  If someone yells 'Fire!' in a theater and causes a stampede it doesn't matter if they're an employee of the business or not, they're still responsible for the aftermath."
37-4-2-4-1-4-2-1,Accountability is different than authority.  Everyone is accountable under the law.  Not everyone has lawful authority.
37-4-2-4-3,"Identifying a threat that has demonstrated it is a threat, and continues to demonstrate it's a threat, is identifying a threat correctly.Calling the topmost official in the executive branch of government an ""Enemy of the State"" for no other reason than to intimidate, incite, and disconcert, is straight up, bonafide sedition (""conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state"").  It is right up there with the most serious crimes against the United States including treason."
37-4-2-4-3-1,"so, why isn't this guy in jail?"
37-4-2-4-3-1-1,"Gotta be careful when arresting cult leaders or else the members may resort to violence / suicide.  Take time, build up irrefutable evidence and then the arrest.  Currently pretty late in the building irrefutable evidence part."
37-4-4,"You forgot “downplays a pandemic and kills a million Americans”ISIS, the Taliban, Al Quada, Russia, China, North Korea, Hitler, none of our greatest enemies have ever killed a million Americans."
37-4-4-1,600K Americans were killed in the US Civil War. It seems like our greatest existential threats have always been domestic.
37-5,I think calling Biden an enemy of the state is one of the most dangerous comments he's ever made. It means he's telling you EXACTLY how he plans to deal with Biden if he's elected again.
37-5-1,He's actually suggesting how he wants his base to deal with Biden now. Which is probably yet another federal crime that will go unpunished. Stochastic terrorism is a hell of a drug.
37-5-1-1,I’m so sick of seeing this dude in the news for any reason other than being cuffed and booked.
37-5-1-3,"this is the most fucked part to me..  he says all this super fucked shit, with zero impunity, zero consequences, because his maga army will carry out whatever he wants.  it's literally a cult by definition..  and is an immediate threat to our country."
37-5-3,"How does a civilian declare a president enemy of the state? He must not know what ""the state"" means."
37-5-3-1,He’s trying to do a fascist “flip the table” move where he implies that he is the “rightful” head of state/like Nixon he “is the state.”It also implies that democracy is not the legitimate source by which the mandate to lead- which is pure fascism and it’s exactly what his base believes.
37-5-3-1-1,"It’s a very common tactic for narcissists- D.A.R.V.O.Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender."
37-5-3-1-2,"Exactly, more people need to understand this.And when he says ""deep state"", he means the real, democratic (small d) government. When Trump and his supporters say they're going to overthrow the deep state, destroy the deep state, etc. they're talking about overthrowing/destroying our current government.If even Mike Pence is part of the ""deep state"" for performing his Constitutional duties and certifying the results of the democratic election, that's all you need to tell you what exactly they mean by ""deep state"".In their eyes, they are trying to finish off what they see as the old, former America, the deep state, and replace it with a new, post-America, Trumplandia.When Trump says the ""deep state"" raided Mar-A-Lago, he's saying Old America raided the headquarters of New Trumplandia. When he says Biden is ""the enemy of the state"", he's saying that Biden, the head of Old America, is an enemy of New Trumplandia."
37-5-3-1-2-1,"It feels like they’re trying to fudge his way into history.It’s frustrating to know half the nat’l demographic gets its news from a source that the *other* half disagrees with, but here we are in the year of our lord, 2022. Even Deloreans are a thing again."
37-5-5,I really hope SS is on high alert now if they aren't already. It's a matter of time before some nutjob tries something.
37-5-5-1,I was even worried during the Philadelphia speech that something bad was going to happen. These people have lost touch with reality and are being goaded on by a maniac.
37-5-5-1-1,"And what’s worse is they’ve convinced themselves that the other side are the ones with that exact same problem. It’s like a successful nationwide version of “no, u”"
37-5-5-1-2,He sure was bold to make the speech there and I’m all for it symbolically. That area in Philly is not well guarded and very open to public. He didn’t care and saw a need for the speech. I respect him a heck of a lot more than I did before the speech.
37-5-5-1-2-1,For sure.  I was relieved when I'd learned the president had a huge protective glass shield in front of him at least.
49,Texas sues Biden admin for requiring abortions in medical emergencies
49-1,"*Texas attorney general Ken Paxton (R) sued the Biden administration over federal rules that require abortions be provided in medical emergencies in order to save the life of the mother, even in states with near-total bans.* So don't save the woman NO MATTER WHAT is his stance. WTAF"
49-1-1,It makes absolutely no sense because the Texas Heartbeat Act has the same exception.
49-1-1-1,"Correct, they already allow emergency case abortions NOW.. but they wouldn't be able to get rid of it in the future because of this.."
49-1-1-1-2,So... they are telegraphing the intention to remove it in the future?
49-1-1-1-2-1,Of course they are. If the woman dies then it must be God's will.I would mark this as sarcasm but it is literally how they think.
49-1-1-1-2-1-2,"These sick fucks are pulling us right back to the dark ages, no exaggeration.Anyone else catch Senator Marshall on Tuesday talk about the numerous 13-yo mothers he treated as an ob/gyn...then pivoted immediately, in the same sentence, to brag about how his practice always provided adequate post-natal care to ""*all* women"" to help them be ""successful mothers""? (I may have shouted ""you sick fuck!"" at the screen.)"

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg attaches to the wrong part of a woman's body. Around 90% of the time the egg attaches to the fallopian tube during an ectopic pregnancy, which can cause serious internal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable and can lead to death without proper healthcare.^[[1]]Republican states, including Ken Paxton & Texas, are pushing for total abortion bans that are going kill a lot of women."
49-1-3-3,Haven’t noticed you around lately. I really appreciate the work you have done to help us stay informed. Thank you.
49-1-3-3-1,Thanks for taking the time to read! I've been busy with life so I'm not as active. Spend my free time on hobby subs and occasionally discuss Canadian issues including the rising trend of white nationalism in Canada.
49-1-3-3-1-1,"That trend is really worrying me at the moment. I live in the lower-mainland region of BC and I feel that I'm pretty well isolated from those types here but the other day I was driving the upper levels highway and I see four trucks driving with giant ""F\*\*\* Trudeau"" flags on them. At first I just kind of rolled my eyes and thought they were dipshits but once I got closer I saw a number of stickers that worried me even more. One truck had ""1488"" and ""Wh\*te lives matter"" stickers and another one had a big one that just said ""14 words"". Terrifying!I hate seeing that shit here so much. I donate to local anti-hate groups and do some volunteering but I really wish there was more I could do to fight the rising hate here."
49-1-3-3-1-1-3,"1488, 14 words? Eli5 please"
49-1-3-3-1-1-3-1,"14 words is a white supremacy slogan about maintaining the white race. 1488 is a common neo-nazi calling card, the 14 references the 14 words and the 88 means hiel hitler as H is the 8th letter in the alphabet."
49-1-3-3-1-3,Happy cake day!
49-1-3-4,"Adding to this: ectopic pregnancies are not always easily diagnosed, and are occasionally “pregnancies of unknown location.”So even if there is an exception for ectopic pregnancies, there will be situations where doctors cannot operate until there is a clear diagnosis or until the woman starts hemorrhaging, which would be too late in many cases.Sometimes the decision is between having an abortion and waiting and hoping you don’t die.And idk about y’all, but I do not want the government making that decision for me."
49-1-5,"how the fuck is ken paxton not is prison yet? HELL, how is he still the AG after several felony charges???? WTF"
49-1-5-1,"Even more amazing is that Republican voters in Texas HAVE a choice AND still choose Paxton.George P Bush challenged Paxton in the Republican primary, and Paxton won. (There was a runoff, and Paxton [won that runoff].)So Texas Republicans could have had a Republican candidate for Attorney General in the general election. And in statewide elections in Texas, Republicans usually win easily. Which means Republicans could have chosen to probably keep a Republican in this spot. But they didn't want just that. They wanted Ken Paxton."
49-1-5-1-1,"Honestly it may also be related to their ""news"" consumption.They likely are totally unaware of Paxton's crimes since he's a Republican and Fox/OANN/Newsmax would only report on his bullying culture war crap they're a fan of."
49-1-5-1-1-1,"Even if they are aware, it's not like they'd care anyway (""at least he's not a democrat though""). Paxton is good at ""owning the libs"" and that's literally all Texan conservatives care about."
49-1-5-2,"Because they've been delaying the trial for years now, mostly by arguing about where the fucking trial should be held. As of March, it's ""officially on the docket"" but presumably there will be further delays, because why wouldn't there be?"
49-2,What next Texas? are you going to sue because you might be required to fix your power grid and have fair voting policies?
49-2-1,Literally yes they would
49-2-1-1,Abbott and Paxton have a lot of money tied up in grifting off a broken grid.
49-2-1-1-1,"Well yeah. We wouldn't want them to have to come up with another excuse for perpetrating the single biggest crypto scam (and possibly biggest scam, period, by the time it's over) ever.For those out of the loop: there's a really delicious article in Texas Monthly right now explaining in detail exactly how they're fucking over millions of people to farm Bitcoin by using taxpayer dollars to subsidize a crypto farm that literally uses as much electricity as Houston every month. But I mean, it's not like y'alls power grid is famously failing in real time or anything, no worries. Next time you're freezing to death in the dark you can take comfort in the fact that Abbott and his golf buddies have figured out how to turn conning Texans into generational wealth for them and their families "
49-2-1-1-1-2,This is absolutely true! We’re under a water and electrical conservation order and they have the nerve to sue over this shit! Not to mention all the other insane laws they are trying to pass to stay in power! Paxton should have gone to jail 5 or 6 years ago as he’s been under FBI investigation. Abbot is worse! He has his hand in every energy money pot from the grid to oil to tech! The corruption is breathtaking!
49-2-1-2,
49-2-1-2-1,Is that photoshopped or real
49-2-1-2-1-2,Do you mean did Texas go dark for an entire week last year during a snow storm? Yep. People died.
49-2-1-2-1-2-1,"a week? i didn't have power for 9 days, and water for almost 2 and a half weeks.going to the apartment pool to scoop up water to flush your shit got old really quick."
49-2-2,"Well, the 2nd part, yes.They literally plan to change the way all state offices are picked - by instituting a state electoral college. This plan would have electors from each state senate district ""elect"" all state positions. So, every legislator, the governor, sec of state, AG...would all be picked by (currently) a 19-12 GOP majority.Then they plan to change the way amendments to the state constitution are passed. They want to change it from a simple majority (>50%) of ALL Texas voters, to a simple majority in 3/4ths of TX counties (191 counties). Doing the math...that's 5.5% of the TX population (50% of the 191 most rural counties) that could then pass an amendment to the state constitutionand all that's in addition to the shit they've already pulled with redistricting, voter regulations, and empowering the AG to investigate election ""fraud"".Wheee."
49-2-2-1,"Leaving too much power to the states was a potentially fatal mistake to the integrity of the nation. There's little the federal government can do against this particular type of bullshit, and the GQP has been exploiting the fuck out of such flaws for decades to protect their power base."
49-2-2-1-1,They want to destroy the country. They want each state to be its own little feifdom that can easily be managed by whatever group of rich bastards lives in the area. Read this book **Democracy in Chains by Nancy MacLean.**
49-2-2-1-1-1,....for now.It's a weird situation where the rich paid off fundamentalists to target them at anyone who might threaten their wealth....but that elevated a whole population of super-fundies who are now chomping at the bit to declare the independent nation of Jesusland.It's easier to do this kind of thing through divide-and-conquer methods...but once the foundation is secure they'll go back to unifying their control. It's a system that literally *cannot* leave others alone.
49-2-2-1-1-1-1,"If Texas became independent, the uber-rich  would move."
49-2-2-1-3,"Good government only functions if those involved in it are willing to act in good faith.There's no governmental structure that can survive a bad faith attack on it by its elected officials and the ""people"" championing those elected officials.You can try to limit it, and avoid it through voting. But eventually push will come to shove."
49-2-3,They’re effectively suing Biden’s administration for wanting to save lives. And for being Democrats.Can’t imagine living in that backwards hellhole. Florida and Texas are birds of a feather.
49-2-3-1,"I used to love Texas, really. I haven't fel that way in a long while. This administration has done nothing to address the issues that face Texans while playing up the culture war and turning this state into a minority-ruled theocracy. I'm really sad for our state, there are good people who live here, I just hope they all vote."
49-2-3-1-1,It’s gotta be fear from established republicans about the state either turning purple or blue in the coming years. This is them doubling down and hopefully this is them shooting them selfs in the foot lol
49-2-3-1-1-1,I can only hope. I also see a lot of people talking about leaving the state altogether. Some republican commentator said that the roe ruling would have the added benefit of chasing people out of certain states. I think the same can be said about the anti-lgbt stuff. They are shitheads but they also think they will be able to purge certain parts of the country by being this way.
49-2-3-1-2,"Only thing I like about this state is the bbq. If I could uproot my whole family, I would. 2 girls just starting middle school and they are learning another language to hopefully get a job in another country when they finish school."
49-2-3-1-2-2,"Having lived in the South for several years... It's not that hard to make regional specialty foods anywhere else. If I can liberate ""Southern cooking"" from the South, you can liberate brisket from Texas."
49-2-3-3,"Sure as shit I wanna see one of their wives or daughters come into the ER with a big fat ectopic pregnancy about to blow. I never used to wish bad things on people I disagreed with, but these disgusting piles of shit pushed me past common decency."
49-2-3-3-1,I’d rather see them walk into a clinic with *their mistress.*
49-2-3-3-1-1,"They will fly to another state/country to get their abortions and go right back to dancing on top of poor dead women's tombstones. ""Shouldn't have opened your legs if you didn't have enough cash for a plane ticket."""
49-2-3-3-2,The time for decency has passed since 2016. Democrats need to learn that taking the high road is a losing strategy. It's a zero sum game for Republicans.
49-2-3-5,Yep I fucking hate it here
49-2-4,Or making consumers in other states pay for their power issues.
49-2-4-1,I don’t understand how this happened considering Texas is paying so much more for their electricity citing the freeze.
49-4,"Remember all those Republicans that claimed abortion would still be legal for life-saving emergencies? Think again, because Republicans (not just Texas) would rather see people die than get an abortion. I don’t know how these sick monsters even sleep at night."
49-4-1,They would also prefer to see people die than to wear a mask.  I just don't get it.
49-4-1-1,They would also prefere lgbtq kids to die rather than let their own children be exposed to diversity and reality
49-4-1-1-1,"I think Republicans just want people to die in general. They don’t gain anything from it, but they genuinely want people to suffer"
49-4-1-1-1-1,"The ""just world"" fallacy, writ large.If bad things happen to you, you must have done something to deserve it."
49-4-1-1-1-1-1,Some people stop developing emotionally and morally in their terrible twos.
49-4-1-1-1-3,Republicans often want their own LGBTQIA kids dead.
49-4-2,"They sleep great on their giant beds in their giant houses built off the backs of all of us. Don’t get it twisted, these people don’t give a single fuck about you.You’re but a pebble in their shoe. People like to imagine that these assholes have of some form of conscious and empathy like we do and they have to fight against that to achieve their goals. They don’t.Greedy, power hungry pieces of shit wouldn’t piss on you to stop you from burning alive. You’re actually in their way, they WANT to kill you because it means more money and power for them.We need to focus on that instead of acting like these people are reasonable, rational people who just have a different worldview on where this country should go.They don’t actually care about or believe in the shit they spew, they’re pushing these policies because they will enable more money and power for them and to make it easier to kill off anyone who dissents."
49-5,"Pro-lifers: ""of course we don't want women to die, we just want to stop abortions as birth control!""Also pro-lifers:"
49-5-4,Stop calling them pro life. They're anti choice at best and forced birth at worst.
