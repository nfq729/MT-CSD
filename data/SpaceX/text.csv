1,"Oh my God, the SpaceX explosion was much worse than it seemed."
1-1,good explanation of the launch and what went wrong
1-1-2,"I saw this video yesterday and I still, for the life of me, don't understand why the decision was made to not have any sort of dampening mechanism. No diverters, no water. I understand what happened, but what nobody can answer is why 60 years of launch data was ignored; this result was easily foreseeable!"
1-1-2-2,Exactly. We don’t need any of what Elon’s stupidity just delivered. The private space industry and SpaceX are spinning propaganda left and right here. We all know NASA already knew this. Elons out there acting like it’s the 1960s.
1-1-2-3,Musks ego wouldn't allow any further delays.
1-1-2-3-1,Has to launch on 4/20 or everyone's getting fired!
1-1-2-4,"It's literally explained at 1:30 in the video. They want something that can land and take off from Mars, where they won't have extensive ground infrastructure ready to go, so the rocket needs to be able to work without it one way or another."
1-1-2-4-1,"Problem with that take is that Starship is taking off from Mars, not Superheavy. The Starship only uses 3 engines for takeoff, not 33.My personal guess is that they just wanted to see how simple of a pad they could get away with. Since they are testing everything on that pad it has good chance of being destroyed in a testinf failure, so it should be made cheap."
1-1-2-4-1-1,"There was a real chance that it won't liftoff and the whole pad would be blown away. This is a success by any metrics. And people seem to forget it took them less time to launch a water tower to this than it took for just integrating ( not developement ) the SLS, which still costs $4 billion, per launch btw"
1-1-2-4-1-1-1,"> This is a success by any metricsDoing something dumb that everyone tells you is dumb, then then only getting injured instead of killed is not a success, even if you say beforehand ""there's a chance I'll be killed doing this!""Sure, they succeeded with a few things. But that doesn't mean it wasn't fucking stupid to do this. They failed with a lot of things that they could have had a good chance to succeed with if not for this dumb decision."
1-1-2-4-1-1-1-3,"""Fail fast and iterate"" has advantages. While it's wasteful as hell it's also way faster than doing R&D for years and having your very first launch be 100% successful (like Artemis/SLS). As much as I hate Musk I actually agree with the stubborn decision to try and create a pad without a water system, doing things a certain way ""because that's how we've always done it"" is a great way to get stuck in a tech-hole and at least *trying* new concepts is always good. Everyone was making fun of them a few years ago for trying to launch a stainless steel water tower, and look how quickly it's become an actual launch system. My guess is they'll try 1-2 more times to build a pad that doesn't melt and if they fail then they'll go with the standard route."
1-1-2-4-5,"I was a little confused by that explanation. They’re not planning on launching the full starship/super heavy stack from the surface of Mars are they? Just Starship itself right? If so, why bother trying to launch super heavy without any sort of blast diversion?I could understand launching Starship by itself on a concrete pad, just not starship and super heavy together."
1-1-2-5,"Because fucking mElon, that's why. He thinks he's so much smarter than everybody else ever, and he won't be questioned. He's going to get people killed on one or more of these launches. I mean, spaceflight is dangerous, but his ego and narcissism will make it even moreso."
1-1-2-6,"Because that man is not actually competent, he is an investor, not an engineer or scientist. He probably wanted the platform to look nicer, and he decided that the critical platform infrastructure didn't look nice enough to be kept. He has done this with tesla factories, he wants them to look a certain way, even If it slows down efficiency, and makes it more difficult to perform maintenance on the building/equiptment."
1-1-2-8,"Speed. You can spend 6 months trying to improve it using analysis and simulation, and still maybe have it go wrong, or you can just test it now and fix it with far more realistic constraints. It comes down to what makes more money. For spacex, they have a *huge* assembly line to crank out these rockets, and because they make nearly every part in-house, the marginal cost of a rocket is very little (compared to SLS being >2 billion per flight).  On the other hand, waiting 6 months is 6months of lost revenue. If you think that revenue pool is much larger than the cost of rockets, you want to waste as little time as possible. It would be like saying Henry Ford was stupid for having actual practice cars go through the assembly line that could never be sold."
1-1-2-8-2,"And how long is it going to take them to fix the tank farm, and completely reconstruct the launch site from the ground up? I don't do a whole lot of good to have 50 starships .... if you've got no place to launch them."
1-1-2-8-2-2,It might take 2 weeks at most to repair things and rebuild a pad. There was nothing spectacular about the pad's build (which is one reason it came apart so easily)It's like we have a bunch of Kerbal players herer who think they know something.
1-1-2-8-3,They've had literal years to build this thing. Elon just decided not to.
1-1-2-8-3-1,"According to this unsourced tweet with multiple, glaring factual errors."
1-1-2-8-3-1-1,"No, according to his own words: "
1-1-3,"This needs to be higher. I'm all for criticizing Elon about a LOOOOT of things (quite frankly I dislike him quite a bit), but this shouldn't be one of them. There are good reasons everything that happened did. They were expecting things to go wrong. It is an iterative process. The good people over at SpaceX (not you, Elon) know what they're doing."
1-1-3-1,They expected the launch pad to be destroyed?
1-1-3-1-1,"I think they expected damage, but not this much. From Musk's tweet about it, it sounds like they expected the concrete to erode away (which means they expected it to be damaged), but instead it fractured and blew apart. Once the high-strength and high-temperature concrete was gone, it was just dirt left to withstand the forces of the raptor engines."
1-1-3-1-1-1,They ran the engines at 50% and it was fine.    For this launch they ran them at 90% and it blew out the specialized high temp concrete below.
1-1-3-1-1-1-1,"Right. I think they looked at the results of the static fire and said ""this will only work for one launch, but it *will* work."" They were wrong. But it's ridiculous to say that they expected *no* damage and were like ""whaaaat no wayyyy"" afterwards lol."
1-1-3-1-1-1-1-1,"I was assuming they didn't plan for the combined effect that cracking + vibration + heat + air pressure differential would create. I'm not really surprised since it'd be fucking hard as fuck to plan for it without testing it out for real.Each one of those have failure mechanisms that are directly related to each other, and each one is at massive levels beyond anything people typically ever encounter or research. So I don't blame them for it failing.Where I do 100% fault them for, is allowing it to fail on the first test flight. They should have overbuilt the pad with no expense spared. If the vehicle failed to launch because of the launch pad, the press releases would be terrible and SpaceX would take a serious loss. They've invested approx 2-3 billion dollars so far. Then for their first launch to fail because they were penny pinching nutfucks would have been absurd."
1-1-3-1-1-1-1-2,"yeah but like, NASA doesnt have these fuck up's. Why is spacex basically back in the 60's here with the advantage of using newer computers to do their engineering?"
1-1-3-1-1-3,So they didn't expect this and could have avoided it.
1-1-3-1-1-3-1,"Everything is a balance. Yeah, they probably could have avoided it with significantly more money and time. But there's only so much than can be done in a wetland with the water table that high. They took a gamble and lost. That's been the theme of starship from the beginning. This site is not meant to be a permanent launch facility, it's a testing facility. They're already building another starship launch facility at the Cape. And that facility will (or at least... should...) take the lessons learned from Boca Chica to create a reusable launch facility on the scale that SpaceX is expected to need."
1-1-3-1-1-4,"Nah man. Saying they expected a chunk of concrete the size of a swimming pool to go flying through the air is fanboy shit.They built 33 engines so 25% could be lost do debris before the rocket reached its first inch of altitude? Wow, I bet you think things are going great at Twitter too."
1-1-3-1-1-4-1,"What. Nothing you said makes sense. > Saying they expected a chunk of concrete the size of a swimming pool to go flying through the air is fanboy shit.Who said that?> They built 33 engines so 25% could be lostWho has claimed they expected 25% losses?> before the rocket reached its first inch of altitude?They lost like... 2... out of 33... before it cleared the tower. That's not 25%. More engines failed during ascent.> Wow, I bet you think things are going great at Twitter too.Who the fuck is talking about twitter? For what it's worth, Gwynne Shotwell is the reason SpaceX kicks ass, not Musk. Musk can lick my taint after I go on a long bike ride."
1-1-3-1-1-5,"Haha, if this is true their launch pad team is a bunch of dipshits. Brittle failure is the norm for all but a special few concrete and they don’t tolerate heat well. Thinking it would “erode” after multiple extreme thermal loading events is comical.."
1-1-3-1-1-5-1,"They used a special form of concrete that has been used in other flame diverter trenches. A form of concrete that is designed to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. They tested all 33 engines at 50% thrust and made a decision based on the results of the test. They also didn't expect the concrete to survive ""multiple"" launches, but to erode after a single launch to state that was repairable. They already had a water cooled steel solution designed with parts delivered before this launch, but expected the concrete to survive a single launch well enough to retrofit that solution for the next launch. But if you're so confident that you know better, you're welcome to send your resume to SpaceX."
1-1-3-1-1-8,I don’t know what kind of concrete they’re using but normal concrete cracks and kinda explodes on its own when blasted with a hot enough torch. On a small scale I’ve torched a concrete floor and concrete chips go flying. This seems to be exactly what happened except on a larger scale.
1-1-3-1-2,"Not to this degree, and there is an air of truth to the post. Most ""I don't like defending Elon, but *insert comments defending him here*"" comments are from people who still have a soft spot for him.People keep citing their statements, which has to be approved by him before being released. And if anyone mentioned him in a negative light or said anything publically they'd be sued into oblivion by him.Just like BP didn't make a statement saying: ""Our CEO cut corners and is to blame for this"" after the big oil spill."
1-1-3-1-3,"They expected damage, but not that much. The pad damage isn't too consequential anyways since they were already planning on ripping the concrete up and replacing it with a giant watercooled steel plate"
1-1-3-2,"I've been following the development of Starship from the beginning and remember when Elon tweeted this over two years ago:""Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake""[He's taken a lot of shortcuts with the process and it's why they've made so much progress so fast.   But it was clear from the 3 engine tests with Starship that they needed one -- it was borderline irresponsible to fire 33 rockets of SuperHeavy without one."
1-1-3-2-1,They replaced the concrete after earlier tests with a much more durable mixture that they expected would survive this launch reasonably well enough.
1-1-3-2-1-1,Then they’re idiots. Engineering is a precise science. You don’t just “expect” it will work. You know. These engineers are either fools or are being crippled by the stupidity of Elon. My bet is on the latter.
1-1-3-3,"If they expected it, why allow cars to park close enough that debris landed on them?That seems like a major failure of safety controls."
1-1-3-4,"They expected things to go wrong, yes, but how much was it that they expected?    Do you seriously believe they expected engines to take damage from blowing up the concrete for example?  There is a limit to how much you can give them a pass for."
1-1-3-5,"If this was an iterative process, then why did they not test this with a much smaller rocket, or continue doing simulations? How many millions of dollars did this rocket take to make? How much pollution did it release when it exploded?In the 1960s, not a single Saturn I or Saturn II rocket blew up. Not. A. Single. One. Because they tested all of their rockets beforehand. Because *obviously* they did - why would you waste millions of dollars building a full-size rocket that you know is going to blow up?Either this was not an iterative process and it was a catastrophic failure, OR it was an iterative process and SpaceX is just wasting a shit ton of money for publicity and hype, and polluting the environment even more while doing it."
1-1-3-6,Yeah a bunch of armchair quarterbacks that know nothing about rocket science are circle jerking over one rocket (which was going to explode regardless) exploding
1-1-3-6-1,"Yeah, when the person in the post started talking about jets I knew they had nothing of value to add to the conversation."
1-1-3-6-4,There  is literally comments with 1k+ upvoting arguing how inefficient the private sector space economy is. Like my god is takes a few second to know you are massively wrong.
1-1-3-6-4-1,SpaceX has made launching stuff to space orders of magnitude cheaper. They are so far ahead in the rocket game it’s not even funny.
1-1-3-6-4-1-1,"as much as i appreciate their progress, NASA could have done exactly the same thing with an equal budget and as few limitations"
1-1-3-6-4-1-1-1,"I mean, you can say that about anyone if you change how they fundamentally work.Home Depot could have done the same thing if they hired a bunch of rocket engineers and decided the wanted to get into the spaceflight business.You can't just say ""NASA could do it if they didn't have limitations"" because thqt won't happen.Besides, after the end of shuttle, NASA explicitly did not want reusability. Look at the EELV program.F9 or a rocket like it would never have happened without a startuppy outsider company."
1-1-3-6-4-1-1-2,NASA was paying the russians to launch their astronauts to space before SpaceX. Who do you think is funding the starship mission? Do you actually think that NASA builds their own ships?
1-1-3-6-4-1-1-3,Yeah for 50x the cost and 5x the time. Just look at the cost of one SLS launch vs the expected cost of on Starahip launch. It's literally over 100 times more efficient.
1-1-3-6-6,"Nobody tell them they have been destroying Falcon 9’s for years in similar tests to develop landing capabilities. Lay-observers think these “boom booms” are bad because they don’t normally happen. But for SpaceX, the ability to throw rockets away in high-risk, high-reward tests is a sign of status. They are vertically integrated. Blowing up a rocket costs only the raw materials and labor, which are very little when you are building rockets on an assembly line. No other company could afford to replicate their test flights."
1-1-3-6-8,TIL rocket science was someone lost entirely from the past 70 years so SpaceX is starting from nothing.
1-1-3-6-8-1,"Well they just launched the most powerful rocket ever, in the history of mankind. So yeah they’re gonna have to figure out a few things on the way. It’s literally uncharted territory"
1-1-3-8,"> They were expecting things to go wrong. It is an iterative process.Because they knew it hadn't been built properly?> The good people over at SpaceX (not you, Elon) know what they're doing.Doesn't matter if elongated muskrat can overrule them on a whim."
1-1-4,This is a good reminder to everyone that Reddit subs are echo chambers. This one in particular hates Elon. anyone who follows rocket/space YT knows the reality of the situation.
1-1-4-1,"It is bizarre how the Elon hate (understandable) translates into these really weird, and unscientific takes. You can dislike a person and at the same time not say false things to create some narrative about an impressive engineering accomplishment."
1-1-4-1-6,"I'm generally supportive of SpaceX but it's increasingly hard to look at anything Elon Musk does and not immediately disagree with him. Like, I think this launch was a great success but I get the hate."
1-1-4-1-6-3,"> ... hard to look at anything Elon Musk does and not immediately disagree with him.The people working ""under"" him share this. There was the story from inside Tesla where there was a whole process about shepherding him around the company to keep him interfering./edit: Well, not disagreeing with him. Rather disregarding him."
1-1-4-1-6-3-1,You are the perfect example of wha the person was saying.  A random person on Twitter makes up this story and half of Reddit treats it as gospel because it’s negative towards Musk.
1-1-4-1-6-5,The problem is that people hate Elon for spreading lies. Spreading lies *about* Elon is not a good look for them.
1-1-4-1-6-6,"That's called being a contrarian. One should try to never be a contrarian, because it removes all critical thought.If Elon said ""puppies are the best, I love dogs"" that doesn't mean you should be suspicious of dogs. Even a broken clock is right two times a day.If we don't put intellectual scrutiny above emotional reactions then we are no better than Elon."
1-1-4-1-6-6-4,Except as it’s been pointed out that a significant factor in the failure of this launch is due to Musk’s ego.
1-1-4-2,"I am not so sure about this. If it was an iterative process, they would have launched the rocket first with trench and then try to figure out how to do it without the trench. Being an engineer, I can vouch for the fact that no engineer would have asked for a launch with two unknown variable at same time, the rocket itself and the launch pad."
1-1-4-3,"As someone who works in aerospace I'm extremely dissapointed at how the media and general public is handling this. Obviously the general public is comprised of idiots but I feel like journalists should know better but I guess ""SPACEX ROCKET EXPLODE!!! ELON BAD"" sells more newspapers than ""Rocket expected to blow up on pad manages to survive Max-Q, fails stage separation and has successful FTS trigger"". This flight was a success by basically every measure although yes they should have really had a better cooling trench (The Artemis 1 launch is a good example of what adequate dampening for the launch pad looks like) but now that they know this is a serious issue they can just fix it before the next test flight.I feel like people just want to criticize anything Elon Musk does anymore when the reality is that SpaceX is a huge success thanks to the fact Elon is bankrolling people who do, in fact, know how to make a successful rocket company."
1-1-4-3-1,"Was it really a success? They blew apart the launchpad, which in turn likely damaged the launch rocket and made it to behave in a way less expected fashion."
1-1-4-3-1-1,"They were willing to damage the rocket to get some flight data.  By the time new launchpad design is done, they'll have another rocket ready to fly, they move fast and run tests when minimally ready."
1-1-4-3-1-2,"Well now they know not to do that next time. That’s the point of these test flights, fail as early as possible in development. It is some degree of a setback but my honest opinion is the fact that super heavy didn’t instantly explode on the pad means it’s a successIf this was a rocket with people or a payload that would be a different story but this is just a test flight paid for by SpaceX under IRAD."
1-1-4-3-2,Did it reach anything like a realistic Max-Q? It was going way too slow and low long before it blew up. You're skipping a lot of inconvenient facts here to try to claim this was a success.
1-1-4-5,All of Reddit hates Elon except for a handful of subs related to his companies.The hate he gets is unbelievable.
1-1-4-5-1,Is it tho? Is it really?
1-2,"Well, one big error there - that was the *first* launch off that pad. Granted, there had been some short test fires of the booster while on the launch mount, but not three years worth."
1-2-1,"Not to mention they have the name of Starship wrong, the wrong engine count, and the wrong number of engines that malfunctioned"
1-2-1-2,uh I think u mean *jets* 
1-2-6,I don’t think the implication is that three year’s worth of debris shot up into the rockets. That part was supposed to emphasize that there were three year’s worth of warnings from less powerful rockets.
1-3,Of course this fuck up goes to elon
1-3-1,And he’ll foist the blame off on some poor engineer
1-3-1-1,Not if he's eaten by a brontaroc first.
1-3-1-1-2,"Not sure what a brontaroc is but as long as it eats Elon, I don’t really care. Hell, I hope it gobbles up every billionaire and money-obsessed capitalist at once. The world would be such a better place."
1-3-1-1-2-1,Watch the movie “Don’t Look Up”!
1-3-1-1-2-1-1,It’s on my list but I’ve been saving it for when I feel as though I can handle the inevitable post-viewing depressive episode.
1-3-1-1-2-1-1-1,"you'll enjoy finding out what a brontaroc is, though"
1-3-1-1-4,A what now?
1-3-1-1-4-1,Don't Look Up
1-3-1-3,Not sure he even cares enough.  He seems to be having a giddy ol’ time on Twitter these days owning… *everyone*?
1-3-1-3-1,"Ummmm, it's ""Titter"" now, according to the sign I saw because he's a child."
1-3-1-3-1-1,"Tesla sells a model S, 3, and an X.This is what happens when an immature memelord gets his hands on absurd amounts of money."
1-3-1-3-1-1-2,"I get being ""funny"" but at least put out a quality product. I feel like I'd trust Phil Swift and Flex Tape more. Elon probably used some on the Rocket."
1-3-1-4,And then backtrack a week later when his lawyers explain the potential consequences.
1-3-1-4-1,He hasn’t fired his legal team already?
1-3-1-4-1-2,He fired Twitters legal right after they beat him in court and forced him to buy it.
1-3-2,"Some things don't need cutting corners. Well, he never learns."
1-3-2-2,"Respectfully, you people have no idea what you’re talking about.Nobody’s ever built a rocket this big before. You can’t simulate the exact requirements for a launchpad on this scale, you have to go out and physically test.The fastest, cheapest option was to build something basic, blow it up, then build properly using the data you generate. Which is what they did.Overbuilding every single thing to the point of “failure is not an option” is why SLS costs $1.2b per shot."
1-3-2-2-1,"Em, do you know what engineers do for a living?"
1-3-2-2-3,"So if the ones smaller than this needed flame trenches and sound suppression systems why wouldn't this, the larger one, need them? Magic?"
1-3-2-2-3-1,"To be reusable, yes, the pad needs those systems. Now tell me: how big do they need to be?Large? Very large? Flame deflection pyramid with billion litre deluge system?What happens when you spend an extra two years building a very large system and it still collapses?"
1-3-2-2-3-1-1,"Compared to building a rocket engine, the launch pad is an absolute cake walk. You already have a very close estimate of the amount of thrust generated, the temperature of the exhaust, hell even the air flow from the engines. It's not like it's some huge unknown that's impossible to predict. Elon doesn't need your help defending his stupid decisions."
1-3-2-2-3-1-1-1,"Super Heavy is putting out explosive energy equivalent to 200 tonnes of TNT per second. It's the biggest rocket ever attempted by a large margin.The only comparable launch pad is in Florida, and they're not allowing an experimental rocket anywhere near it. Hence Texas.There's a reason why the actual space subreddits are chilling right now, but White People Twitter is having an aerospace themed meltdown. Elon is a douche, but space is bigger than him."
1-3-2-2-5,"You know the contractor saying, “cut twice, measure once.” There have been plenty of “biggest”, or “tallest”, or “fastest”, or other exciting adjectives to describe an engineering “first” that extrapolated upon existing tech that didn’t catastrophically fail. Nobody expects experimental rocket testing to go smoothly, but when someone makes a literal executive decision disregarding engineering requirements thus accumulating unneeded risk and preventing additional valuable data/metrics/telemetry from being gathered ALL AT THE COST OF TAXPAYER $$$$, it’s entirely fair to call that megalomaniac out for his fuckery."
1-3-2-2-5-1,"Or, you spent $100m and six months building a flame trench that still gets blown up on launch one. And now launch 1 is end of 2023, launch 2 is well into 2024, and we've wasted a shitload of time and money.The key question is ""what are the engineering requirements for a re-usable stage 0"". You can't know that until you test."
1-3-2-2-5-1-1,"Well, no. You simulate and math it out. The engineers did know, and it was cut as a cost saving measure. This isn't the first time ever that a rocket has been used."
1-3-2-2-6,"I know more about rockets than Elon. I know to listen to my engineers. Elon is a fucking legend for barging into meetings on projects he had nothing to do with, demanding they start again using his design, and gets outraged when people tell him it won’t work. You know those gull wing doors? That piece of shit feature? How about those door handles? No LiDAR for FSD? Take the radar out too? Hyperloop hype just to prevent CA from developing high speed trains? I would sure as fuck listen to an aerospace engineer if they told me how to build a launch pad. I would definitely trust a team of engineers, who I’m paying multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars per year each, when they tell me how to do something they’ve gotten advanced degrees in and worked on for their entire careers."
1-3-2-2-8,"Reddit, do your thing, and DOWNVOTE THIS ELON LOVER!!!!!!!"
1-3-3,When you want all the credit for when things go right.... You also get all the blame when shit goes wrong.Fuck Elon.
1-3-4,There was a flood of Musk simps trying to explain how genius this whole explosive failure was.
1-3-4-1,"Some dumbass Elon stan on here was arguing that the engineers built the pad without a flame trench specifically so that they would blow the pad up and gather data on what happens. These people will distort and twist reality to justify every stupid thing Elon does, and they’ll do it faithfully and reliably until that rich fuck dies"
1-3-4-2,"This was a test launch of a prototype? Dude Elon isn't building these rockets, scientists and engineers are, this was a successful test since their expectation was just to get off the pad. This success goes to them not Elon, pretty simple stuff."
1-3-4-2-1,"He may not be building the rockets, but he’s overruling the engineers that are. The engineers told him the launchpad wouldn’t work and he overruled that and now it’s just a big crater. This huge rocket could’ve gone even further if his decision hadn’t craterized the launch pad."
1-3-4-2-1-1,"Further to where? They were not trying to send this to orbit. This rocket successfully launched off the launch pad...Look I would take the tweet from Jeneral Anxiety with a big grain of salt. She even called rockets jets which is plainly wrong. I have no doubt that Musk argued with engineers, but i have no idea if he actually overruled them completely or came to an agreement.Either way, the engineers got their data which was the whole point of this launch. Building a cheap pad makes sense if you're worried about an expensive one getting obliterated because this rocket was a first of its kind. The data collected will show what will be ideal."
1-3-4-2-1-1-1,"How does building a cheap pad here make sense when the launchpad exploded, generating a bunch of huge concrete shrapnel that damaged the rockets? If you look closely at the videos, you can see one huge chunk of concrete reach almost halfway up Super Heavy when it launches, while another chunk reaches the top of the lift off frame. Another video shows chunks of concrete generating huge splashes of water as they crash into the ocean. They were expecting some easily repairable damage to the launchpad, but they definitely weren’t expecting the launchpad to get so obliterated that it became the cause of Spaceship’s destruction."
1-3-4-2-1-1-1-1,"The launch pad launched the rocket. Regardless of anything, the launch pad did work.The goal was to learn. That includes finding out what you can get away with and what you can't. Was this a perfect launch? No, but the rocket didn't explode on the launch pad, so this is very far from being a failure."
1-3-4-2-2,I've heard this before. There was no success here and it looks profoundly awful for SpaceX right now.
1-3-4-2-2-1,all I know is NASA hasnt blown up a rocket in decades. Why we're starting over from scratch making all new mistakes is beyond me.
1-3-4-2-2-2,What would have a successful launch looked like if the goal wasn't to get it into orbit?
1-3-4-2-2-2-1,"""My goal tonight is to not shit my pants until at least 11pm.""Later: ""Success!"""
1-3-4-2-2-2-2,Making sure you have a launch pad for next time would be a good start.
1-3-4-2-2-2-2-1,"I'm confused by this comment and don't understand everyone's focus on it. Remember science needs data. Why build a super expensive launch pad that might fail launching this massive rocket, or build a cheap one and collect data to build a more appropriate one? Remember, scientists and engineers are smart, so I'm pretty sure there is a justifiable reason. Or they just didn't expect it to get obliterated. Either way, they needed the data and got it...I just don't think people here understand what a test launch of a prototype entails. It is meant to show weaknesses and to learn from mistakes in order to upscale the rocket further."
1-3-4-2-2-2-3,>What would have a successful launch looked likeMaybe not turning the launch pad into rubble and damaging the rocket in the process?The rocket itself isn't really the focus of the negative attention.
1-3-4-2-2-2-3-1,"Yeah the goal wasn't to keep the launch pad intact, the goal was to launch the rocket. Which they did successfully, so you can't call the successful launch a failure because you had different expectations than the engineers."
1-3-4-2-2-2-4,"When designing a car, you expect it to go through a few crash tests, correct? Why can’t a cheap, essentially mass produced prototype rocket do the same?"
1-3-6,"Look.  All of the hype around this thing is built on the idea that this fucking thing is going to land vertically, directly on those fucking engines, and be able to take off and land multiple times per day. If SpaceX goes around building flame trenches and diverters and specialty infrastructure, then Elon's gonna look like an idiot when he promises that it'll be able to take off directly from the natural surface of the moon.So no, they will do no absolutely zero preparation and they WILL launch it on 4/20, and no, Musk doesn't care that it's not ready, he has memes he needs to shitpost by blowing up a nature reserve."
1-3-6-2,People don't understand that this was also a test for stage 0 mainly.  There were little expectations that it would even go as well as it went.  Like you said. They're not trying to just send a rocket up.  They could have done that.  They're trying to test the limits of every part to know what to improve.  This test was successful in showing that the current stage 0 is not enough.
1-4,This post is riddled with misinformation.
1-4-2,And hysteria.
1-4-3,Point it out then
1-4-3-1,"They’re rockets, not jetsIt’s called Starship, not SpaceshipThe company had plans to install blast mitigation systems but calculated they could do without them for this test in order to move forward quicklyThere hadn’t been previous launches from this padThe FAA would not be “insane” to let them keep launching because they have an incredible record of success as the world’s only operator of reusable launch technology, which they developed, and this test proceeded approximately as expected and was successfully aborted when the rocket reached a point of failure without harm to anyone"
1-4-3-1-1,Way to bend over backwards to justify giving SpaceX more government money!
1-5,"The private sector, everybody."
1-5-1,Im finally reading Jurassic park and I love how in the book a shitload of the problems are attributable to it being a private company operating offshore
1-5-1-1,"Even the movie is full of examples of him cheaping out on things. He says no expense was spared, but he's full of shit."
1-5-1-1-1,"He hired a single guy to program everything in the entire park, and paid him so little he was having trouble paying his bills and opted to go for industrial espionage instead."
1-5-1-1-1-1,"Right!?! Even before the heist he asks about a salary increase, and almost seems like he might not go through with the plan if he gets it. That line asking for a raise is him trying to find a reason to not screw over his coworkers and his boss."
1-5-1-1-1-1-1,Wayne Knight always gets fucked over :(
1-5-1-1-1-2,"The book and comics mentions that Denis Nedry was the lowest bidder and was told it would be a zoo with rides. It mentions he was pissed when he learned the scope was WAY bigger than he was told and also the ""zoo"" part was literally fucking dinosaurs. He tried to renegotiate but was basically told either quit or accept his pay. When he tried to quit he was basically threatened that if he quit then he'd be sued and black listed by basically everyone."
1-5-1-1-1-2-1,"But it’s not clear if this is also true in the movie, as in the movie Hammond is a kindly but misguided man while in the book he’s an irredeemable monster."
1-5-1-1-1-3,One screw holding an arrow sign.
1-5-1-1-1-3-2,"I honestly never put that together. I always thought it was so weird that he could spin that arrow, but never once thought of it being due to Hammond cutting costs.I've not yet read the book, so I'm not sure if that's explicitly stated as the reason, but it makes sense"
1-5-1-1-1-3-2-3,the actor playing hammond really made him seem a lot more likeable than the book hammond
1-5-1-1-1-4,"Oh and he didn't put locking mechanisms on the Jeep doors like his own game warden suggested he do because that would cost more money, which resulted predictably in guests getting out of the car mid tour and walking into dinosaur pens. (I watched those movies way too many times)"
1-5-1-1-1-4-1,"Not sure if its in the movie but in the novel security also let him know the raptors were ""testing"" their containment and it needed to be increased."
1-5-1-1-1-5,"Well, it was actually a firm on a shoestring budget. Nedry was just the one on site guy."
1-5-1-1-2,">He says no expense was spared, but he's full of shit.Never cheap out on the tech guy, and treat them like gold as you don't want them turning on you. That's one lesson I learned from that movie. He's the guy who has access to everything and if fucks you over it'll be damn hard to recover. 2nd was that certain frogs can change their sex. I'm waiting for republicans to ban sex changing frogs from their states as they are a threat."
1-5-1-1-2-3,"Something Something turning the frogs gay. (Weirdly an Alex jones was almost right on that one, although the argument should have been for greater regulation regarding chemical waste, not a conspiracy about making all men effeminate)"
1-5-1-1-3,I... I have seen the movie a hundred times and never picked up on that theme.
1-5-1-4,"Real though, it’s funny cause just like in jaws people completely miss the point and think the animals are the issue when in both stories these issues could be easily solved by anyone with a functioning understanding of how to not be greedy and overconfident. Close the damn beach and the shark literally could not kill a single person. Build an actual zoo with the actual exhibit design methods like moats and trenches and physical barriers instead of a couple flimsy wires and the dinosaurs can’t overrun your island. Or in this case do your rocket launch pads right and they won’t blow up in your face as spectacularly lmao."
1-5-1-4-1,">Build an actual zoo with the actual exhibit design methods like moats and trenches and physical barriers instead of a couple flimsy wires and the dinosaurs can’t overrun your island.yes. A lot of zoos will use things like natural elevation (as in putting your animal enclosure in a pit while the guests are up on top looking below) for precisely this reason: so even if something like a power failure happens the animal still can't climb out of there. A T rex might be big, but with those tiny arms it ain't climbing out of shit if it's in a deep enough hole."
1-5-1-4-1-2,"Funnily enough, Jurassic Park (the movie) actually had the T rex in a pit. Except when it didn't. And then it did again.Like, seriously, watch the T rex scene again. The T rex snapped the wires and came out of the pen. But then when the T rex pushes the jeep into the pen, the jeep gets stuck in a tree and there's a solid 30 foot drop down to the bottom of the pen. The physical location in that scene doesn't really make sense, but no one cares because that scene is awesome AF."
1-5-1-4-1-2-1,This T-rex has frog DNA it clearly jumped up that pit /s
1-5-1-4-2,> Close the damn beach and the shark literally could not kill a single personHave you seen some of the sequels? Dem sharks are pretty crafty.
1-5-1-4-2-1,They fly now?? They fly now.
1-5-1-4-3,In a podcast I listen to they were pointing out how you can tell just how fucked the system is when in Jaws 2 the mayor is the same dude that kept telling everyone the beaches were safe and to open them after people had been killed. Lol
1-5-1-4-3-1,"Sounds a lot like East Palestine, Ohio."
1-5-1-4-4,"> like in jaws people completely miss the point and think the animals are the issue*Surely* no one who has seen those movies thinks this? We're not even talking subtext, both movies are VERY explicit about this being the fault of some asshole in charge.."
1-5-1-4-4-1,Every post that even comes within a mile of de-extinction/cloning always inevitably has the “There are 6 movies about why this is a bad idea!!!” comment and Jaws spawned a whole wave of sharkphobia. Media literacy is hard I guess???
1-5-1-4-4-1-1,"Also, lots of people first saw these properties as children and just didn't re-examine their views on them as they got older."
1-5-2,Ayn Rand was f\*cking dead ass wrong about everything.
1-5-2-1,"Now there, The Fountainhead is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."
1-5-2-1-1,I was in prime Ayn Rand age at 16 and bounced off The Fountainhead after the rape scene. The victim fell in love with the rapist main character because he took what he wanted (in other words sex with a woman who didn’t consent) and society couldn’t tell him what to do.
1-5-2-1-1-1,"Yeesh, not that I needed proof that Alan Moore is a better writer than Ayn Rand, but all I can think of is how he wrote about a raped woman falling for her rapist so much better than that."
1-5-2-2,she literally took social security after being aganist it for years.literal hypocrite that should of never been considered for anything.
1-5-2-2-1,"She's fucking OG of all this shit. The more someone says they love Atlas Shrugged, the less I like them.  Usually only takes a sentence or two."
1-5-2-2-1-2,"I remember applying for a college scholarship from the Ayn Rand Foundation, and all I had to do is read The Fountainhead.I'm not mad that I had to force myself through the book, that's not the problem -- rather, instead of a scholarship, all they got me was a copy of Atlas Shrugged."
1-5-2-2-1-2-1,We had a couple posters for this scholarship around my high school due to the dean of students being a fan. I didn't have to get very far into the book to figure out what was wrong with the dean. Went around ripping down the posters every time they popped up. I may have been a little aggressive as you would expect from a newborn commie bastard.
1-5-3,So efficient
1-5-3-2,In this case SpaceX is 10x more efficient than NASA and the SLS. So yes.
1-5-4,"honestly, the private sector is moving much faster, and I must recognize that as much as I despise Elon."
1-5-6,Privatization is a rip off. American  tax dollars still paid for a lot of that.
1-5-7,"I mean, it must be cool to have so much money you can literally just create huge explosions and have no consequences."
1-5-8,How is NASA doing since 1958?  SpaceX is innovating and save money much more than NASA.
2,SpaceX Starship’s First Flight Test - Launch
2-1,"""And we're just waiting for stage separation""As you can see altitude going down."
2-1-1,"They kept the hope up on that broadcast for a *long* time. I was sitting there thinking, ""Guys, c'mon, were a hell of a ways past nominal right now."""
2-1-1-1,"""If it starts pointing to space you are having a bad problem and will not go to space today"""
2-1-1-1-1,Reference: 
2-1-1-1-1-1,"Thanks!BTW, I've been looking to get this as wall art. If anyone knows a way i can do that (or the Saturn blueprint) in a neat/framed way, I would be eternally grateful!"
2-1-1-1-1-1-1,He used to have a store that sold it...
2-1-1-4,woulda been interesting to see the upper stage resume a normal flight had it separated
2-1-1-6,"After the burn back flip executed WITH the second stage attached and ... kept spinning ... yeah. Took another full spin before they said something like, ""this is not nominal"". Still, amazing milestone and onward to launch 2."
2-1-1-7,You could hear groaning in the background.  That's what tipped me off.
2-1-7,"“As we promised, an exciting end to the test flight” wtf was it supposed to blow up? At that moment?“It appears to be spinning but after clearing the tower it’s all icing on the cake”Lol the way she says “it appears to be spinning” is so media trained shit versus “well, it’s spinning and it’s not supposed to be”"
2-1-7-1,"It wasn't supposed to blow up, but they all knew that even if everything went perfectly, all the parts were planned to all crash into the ocean today."
2-1-7-1-1,Ah interesting okay. Sad they’re going into the ocean :( wish there was a litter fine or something
2-1-7-2,">wtf was it supposed to blow upIt wasn't meant to blow up, but the expectation was that it will blow up because making it to separation is unlikely to begin with. The core of the test was to collect data from getting the spaceship off of launch, not the actual flight and separation itself (which is only bonus data)"
2-2,The fact not a single link to it Flippin out of control isn't posted is crazy. go to 1:06:55Edit: This one takes you right to the fun. Thanks to the folks who showed me how to do that.
2-2-1,"Entire thread talking about something that isn't shown in the posted video, and yet I had to scroll this far for the actual video people are discussing...E: I got one of those Reddit care messages after this comment... Wut?"
2-2-1-1,Make sure to report thoseThe people who use them as a super downvote do actually get banned
2-2-1-1-1,"I did report it but I'm more confused than annoyed, not sure what about my comment was so inflammatory but that's Reddit for ya"
2-2-1-1-1-1,"Probably Elon fans attacking any “bad news” about the rocket. They don’t even realise the goal of the launch was simply to get the rocket above 40km, it was successful in that goal."
2-2-1-5,"Not only that, explosion icon in the title is a lie"
2-2-3,Thank you! Thought the rest of the video wasn't loading or something..
2-2-5,"I don't get it, the commentators talk like the explosion was suppose to happen ?"
2-2-5-1,Intentional self-destruct. Avoids a big ol rocket landing on someone minding their business if something goes wrong.Edit: [link for those interested]
2-2-5-1-1,"I don't get the enthusiastic cheering by the SpaceX team about the explosion. Sure the launch part was a success, but don't celebrate the explosion because it's the disappointing part."
2-2-5-1-1-1,"They're just excited that it cleared the tower, that was the main goal. Anything after that is just extra data that can be used for the next flight. Space X had always just blown shit up until it doesn't anymore."
2-2-5-1-1-1-3,I don't get the crazy cheering before the launch.  It hasn't even got off the ground yet.  Talk about celebrating before the finish line.
2-2-5-1-1-2,Because expected and controlled explosions are cool
2-2-5-1-1-3,"> because it's the disappointing part.Disappointing to who? They're clearly not disappointed at all. Even a launch ""failure"" like this provides valuable data that allows them to keep improving. This is what they've been doing for years and it's been a wildly successful strategy. I don't understand why people are suddenly all ""but they obviously failed"" or ""they're just moving the goal posts""."
2-2-5-1-1-3-1,"No, I absolutely get the idea that the test was a success and they're happy. I absolutely am okay that it exploded at some later stage and they will learn from that failure.But, perhaps it's just because I'm British, but all that shouting seems excessive. Then, to further burst into jubilation because it then exploded? Seems frankly weird."
2-2-5-1-1-3-1-1,Think of it as cheering for a milestone rather than the outcome (which was expected anyway).
2-2-5-1-1-3-1-2,"“But, perhaps it’s just because I’m British, but all that shouting seems excessive.”-	Excuse me?  I couldn’t hear you over the House of Commons debate.“Seems frankly weird.”-	I’m going to go google “barrister peruke” - BRB.(Said with love, btw)"
2-2-5-1-1-3-1-3,"They knew the rocket was lost after it started spinning, they’re cheering at the explosion because it marked the end of a successful first launch of Starship, a launch vehicle they have spend many many years on"
2-2-5-1-1-3-1-4,"I guess it's a cheering for the end of phase 1 of their work. Progress was still achieved albeit just a little close to perfection, tho their perfection still would mean the rocket smash into the ocean anyways.Kinda like volleyball teams cheering their teammates even if they lost a point."
2-2-5-1-1-3-1-6,It seems you never worked for years towards a big goal with an enthusiastic team. I feel a bit sorry for you.
2-2-5-1-2,lol are you serious? no it was not supposed to intentionally self destruct. this post is astroturfed to hell.
2-2-5-6,Yes. It was fully expected to explode. They got lucky it cleared the launch pad. They will learn from this for sure. Probably get it right on the second or 3rd launch.
2-2-5-6-1,"It's hard to tell how much is actual ""we kinda figured this would happen"" and how much is the PR spin of ""This is fine. Totally fine. Nothing to see here.""I don't mean that in a snarky way, just genuinely do not know."
2-2-5-6-1-2,"The fact that they called out when it was supposed to separate and it didn't answers that.  It certainly was supposed to separate, you can hear it from the announcers.  Fanfolk are so silly sometimes."
2-2-5-6-1-2-1,It was supposed to separate. It wasn't expected to separate. It was expected to maybe clear the tower and then explode.
2-2-5-6-2,Did they actually mention that prior to the launch? Do you have a source?
2-2-5-6-2-3,"They did. I don't have an exact timestamp from the stream, but they echoed what Musk said. ""Success maybe, excitement guaranteed."" They also have a tongue-in-cheek term for such explosions as ""Rapid Unplanned Disassembly."" Before the launch (and after) they basically just said they would be happy if it at least launched off the ground and anything after was ""icing on the cake."""
2-2-5-6-2-4,Yes. They said in the same video that the purpose of the test today was to test the liftoff and everything that happened after that was the cherry on top
2-2-5-7,"Propaganda, they are told that crowd noise is in the video feed and they need to sell positivity no matter what to echo elon's disinformation - *""Oh cool!! We totally wanted this billion dollar thing to explode, great! I totally meant to do that""*Remember that spacex is (poorly) run by that same odd, lonely, divorced guy that owns Twitter."
2-2-5-7-1,"SpaceX is the most successful rocket company in the world right now, and has been for a while. Outcompeting legacy rocket companies. The first and only to crack significant reusability. Calling it a poorly run company is silly.It's not about wanting it to fail, it's about knowing it might. Please consider that idea seriously. It's a totally plausible understanding. I see how 'PR games' is also a plausible understanding, but seriously, they were not planning on it carrying out the full test.I promise, I'm thinking clearly when I say it's okay that this rocket failed. Of course, it would've been wonderful for them if it did its whole thing and splashed near Hawaii, but they were not betting on that. Truly."
2-3,"My favorite shots from the launch were the ones looking straight up at the engines, were you could see which ones weren't burning. Very cool."
2-3-1,I'm curious if that was intended or the engines failed
2-3-1-1,You can see flashes in the exhaust plume that indicate engine rich exhaust.  Check about 0:52-1:00 in OP's video.
2-3-1-1-1,CH4 ran out before the LOX on the telemetry as well
2-3-1-1-1-1,"I'm willing to bet that some of the plumbing was blown open on the CH4 side, and it was draining fuel."
2-3-1-1-1-1-1,I'm surprised because it looked like the problem was a LOX leak after the engine blew up.
2-3-2,"""There, as we promised, an exciting end to the inaugural integrated Starship test flight.""Audience: ""WOOOOO!"" \*enthusiastic applause\*First the rocket spun, then SpaceX began spinning! "
2-3-2-1,Can't help but be impressed at how it didn't disintegrate flying sideways at max Q for a whole minute. They let it go for as long as possible before blowing it up. They must have got terabytes of data.
2-3-2-1-2,"Ikr, that's a huge succes on its own, maintaining structural integrity like that blows my mind."
2-3-2-2,"The videographer, on NASA’s stream, screaming “did it just went Kerbal?”, spun me"
2-3-2-2-2,I want to imagine NASA probably encourages group sessions of Kerbal Space Program - It has become credible now
2-4,Did anyone see the massive chunks getting blown up off the launch pad? Really made me clench my teeth glad it got off the pad.
2-4-1,Yes! But only on a rewatch. I wonder if that was what caused the engines to burnout/not light. Comparing their launch pad to other launch pads makes it seem like they need to direct the initial blast away somehow.
2-4-1-1,It's okay it looks like they just [dug themselves a flame trench] anyway.
2-4-1-1-2,Wow! That definitely needs a redesign. Don't know how they ever thought they were going to get away with not having a flame trench.
2-4-1-1-2-1,"It's like they saw the Saturn V launch complex, built a bigger rocket and then just went *""Nah, we'll just put a water ring up, stack it higher and see what happens""*.Well, that's what happens idjit.*Big rocket exhaust makes boom booms and shrapnel, big rocket go pretty fireworks display.*"
2-4-1-2,Might need a flame trench like Soyuz has.  
2-4-1-2-3,Link doesn't work. Reddit hug of death?
2-4-1-2-4,I'm wondering how they are going to build that at sea level.
2-4-1-2-6,Designing a rocket that requires a trench would be a massive hurdle for the launch on its return trip
2-4-1-2-6-1,"The trench is only required for the full stack launch with 33 engines, a return trip from Mars or the Moon with only the ship shouldn't need a trench, like the SN8,9,11, a D 15 launches!"
2-4-1-2-6-1-2,Would Starship need a first stage to launch from Mars?  I have no concept of the requirements.
2-4-1-2-6-1-2-1,"Starship can get back to earth without the booster, although it'll need to re-fuel, probably from propellants produced there on Mars. Currently there is no way to get a Super Heavy Booster to Mars anyways."
2-4-1-2-6-2,I get that I really do and I e heard Elon say that as well but my counter point is why?  The booster will NEVER leave earth. Saying “there’s no flame trench on the moon and mars” is a moot point. The booster won’t be there and they have less gravity requiring much less ummmph to take off so you don’t need one there. At this point it’s his ego making not put one in.
2-4-1-2-8,Yeah the flames did seem to get too close to the adjacent infrastructure (like those white storage tanks). Did they miscalculate this?
2-4-1-2-8-1,It certainly feels like they did. They already got in trouble for planning to have the oxygen and methane tanks side by side in the vertical tanks.
2-4-2,"Yep. Multiple suspicious flame puffs near the bottom of the vehicle, multiple engine outs, and a friend of mine noticed the lox indicator draining fast.Tim Dodd apparently was getting sand rained on him from the launch blast *5 miles away.*Debris strike on liftoff does not seem out of the question."
2-4-2-1,"I was noticing those flames, too. Thought I was about to witness an early, low altitude 4th of July celebration."
2-4-2-3,There's also a video of a media van getting pummeled with debris from the takeoff:  
2-4-2-3-1,I believe that van belongs to NasaSpaceflight and it was a sacrificial filming van (they knew it might get damaged when they parked it there).Somehow I suspect they underestimated the sandblasting it was going to receive.
2-4-2-3-1-2,"Definitely, understanding you might have some broken glass is a far cry from basically getting cannonballed like it was the 1800's again. Sweet video though, that chunk came in at a huge rate of speed"
2-4-3,"I'm not a rocket scientist in any sense of the word and obviously they've already thought of everything, but that was one thing that baffled me about the launch pad. No ditch, barely a raised structure, and an insanely powerful rocket? They'll have to rebuild it every time and also pray that giant pieces of metal and concrete don't bounce up and strike the engines or important equipment around the site. I know I'm not the first to think this and they're literally rocket scientists, but it just seems risky."
2-4-3-1,You're not crazy. There's a reason other launch complexes have either a water deluge system or a flame diverter.
2-4-3-1-1,I think the reason is the launch site is far too small for this type of a rocket and they cannot move earth as much as they would like. Reason is environmental regulations for ground water and its location next to a bird sanctuary. Same reason for their cryo tanks standing next to the site and being damaged. They should be in a blast pit but it's not possible.There's dust and debris spotted miles off the site and huge chunks hitting the water and nearby areas. Might be in trouble for getting permits from FAA or local authorities for the next one.Few data points:
2-4-3-1-1-1,This seems less than optimal for the birds.
2-4-3-1-1-1-1,Yes. Giving a permission for a rocket launch site next to a nature preserve seems a bit counterintuitive.
2-4-3-2,"It's the big question everyone is asking, spacex seems to think it's worth it to have the rocket sit that low as opposed to sitting higher away, and we're all here going ummm"
2-4-3-2-1,"Well, to be fair, it is pretty high up. If they raise it up higher, the tower has to also get taller, and it's already massive. They can't raise it any higher, but they could have certainly used a flame trench or deluge system or *something*. And I guarantee they will in the future. This would be the second time the ground stuff damaged the engines. They've gotta do something"
2-4-3-2-1-1,"It's also a test facility, not really a launch facility. It'll be months before they try another Starship launch; plenty of time to repair and modify the ground equipment.Also, the tower and its surrounds are just as experimental as Starship. None of this is final. And SpaceX's MO has always been to try lots and fail lots, working out the bugs through rapid iteration rather than meticulous planning."
2-4-3-2-1-1-2,"I'm a little skeptical at the moment we'll ever see a Starship launch from Starbase again. That launch might have legitimately scuttled it as a facility - they don't have a flame trench right now because they're basically at sea level, and the excavation for it would be tricky. But I seriously doubt the FAA would approve another launch like that, and it would be foolish to try anyway: while they now know the booster will fly (pretty well given the damage), another test where you still don't know your engines haven't been smashed to pieces by exploding concrete isn't going to be worthwhile.If no permitting and approvals start to happen to do some serious excavation to install a flame trench, then I'd say SpaceX are probably going to scrub the facility (at least as a launch site) and move somewhere they can install one."
2-4-5,Elon doesn't sound like the type of guy that would check his o-rings.
2-4-6,Check out these chunks from LabPadre's camera! 
2-5,"Loopty loops are impressive to see a rocket do, but I don't think that's an intended feature"
2-5-1,Such a manoeuvre does speak to some pretty incredible structural integrity of the launch system.
2-5-1-1,"Oh yeah, that was a 20 story building doing a flippty flop , repeatedly"
2-5-1-1-1,"At a ~~high~~ mach number, too."
2-5-1-1-2,"Closer to 40 story building, doing a pinwheel at 1500km/h.Yeah, that's remarkable structural integrity."
2-5-1-2,"They must have gotten an insane amount of structural data from that flight, probably why they waited so long for the FTS."
2-5-1-3,"That's what I was thinking. We just watched a 40 story building do loopty loops and the thing held together. Stage separation obviously didn't work, but might as well see what it does for a few extra seconds to get some more data before you blow it up?"
2-5-1-3-1,It was at max Q when the loops started too. Impressive indeed.
2-5-1-4,"I thought they were a little nutty for making the entire thing out of heavy heavy stainless steel, but I get it now. I bet that high altitude tumble would have caused any other launch system to break apart during that maneuver."
2-5-1-4-2,"Yeah, but since Starship isn't SUPPOSED to do that, it doesn't need to hold up to it. So it holding together actually suggests it's overengineered, and there is room for making it weaker and saving weight somewhere."
2-5-1-4-2-1,"Or keeping the strength in case it's ever needed, I imagine not being a soft balloon helps in space vs radiation and or micro meteorites. Or, in case you accidentally vaporise your own launchpad and basically flakk your own rocket."
2-5-1-4-2-3,"It isn't just, or even mostly about structural integrity, it's about withstanding reentry temperatures, which stainless steel does better than aluminum and for far cheaper than carbon fiber (which for mass testing of totally new systems is key)."
2-5-1-4-2-4,There is something to be said for overengineering this kind of rocket.  There is already a huge increase in efficiency due to it being reusable.  Being a bit overengineered just means it may make it through some situations that would otherwise result in a complete loss.  That could end up saving some very important payloads or even lives.
2-5-1-5,"yeah, this didn't work perfectly, but it was a great stress test for the ol' silo."
2-5-1-5-1,"My goodness, I forgot that v1 was built in a field with sheet steel by water tower and grain silo contractors. And now its the most powerful rocket in history to fly."
2-5-1-5-1-2,"> and it flew on the first attempt.Second attempt, scrubbed on Monday."
2-5-1-5-1-2-2,Fair point! I guess I meant it flew the first time they lit the engines and went for it.
2-5-1-5-1-4,"Is that confirmed? Did it beat the m1 in thrust? If 31 engines lit, it would take the record for the most engines ever, but idk if it had over 30 on after takeoff"
2-5-2,"The first one was, everything afterwards was unintentional flair."
2-5-2-1,"I listened to it again and [they said] ""after stage seperation the first stage will flip and begin a boost-back maneuver"", so the flipping the entire stack was not intended"
2-5-2-1-1,"Negative, the flip is intended, it's the mechanism that separates the booster and the ship. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to release well before a full flip happens, that obviously didn't go as planned."
2-5-2-1-1-1,But why?! Seems like a huge engineering challenge that no other rockets have to deal with? “Linear” stage separation seems like a solved problem.
2-5-2-1-1-1-3,Enough engines went out that they lost pitch control. I dont know why people are saying in this thread that this was part of a planned pitch over when the goddamned thing corkscrewed like an acrobatic pilot before the FTS was activated.
2-5-2-2,"Can you help me understand the flip? Seems like if you want the super heavy booster to go back home you'd separate before the flip, but it seems like flipping before separation was intentional. Wouldn't flipping and then separating (and then flipping Starship again) just make it so Starship and the booster are trying to go through each other?"
2-5-2-2-1,"The booster was to separate first. It would make little sense to flip first and then separate, as the flip takes out a ton of speed, which would use more fuel to speed back up."
2-5-2-2-1-1,"If you watch the livestream, at 10 minutes they have a video of what it should do. Before stage separation it seems the booster+starship flip to about verticle where it then separates. So a 70 degree flip or so."
2-5-2-3,"why tho, i wonder. Isnt it risky to make such a massive rocket spin? is it a normal thing to do?"
2-5-2-3-1,"The flip was probably supposed to happen after stage separation, but that aspect failed for an unknown reason. The programing then triggered the flip of the first stage thinking there was nothing attached to it anymore, but that wasn't the case. At that point, SpaceX probably made a call to just let it play out."
2-5-2-3-1-1,"There were also at least 5 engines out, maybe 6. And you could see the Lox tank was draining way faster than the Methane tank. Looks a lot like a fuel line failed. That plume of fire on the side of the rocket wasn’t supposed to be there, and that does impart force on the side of the rocket. I also find it amusing that whoever was in charge of the spaceX stream hid the Angle of Attack graphic just before stage separation. Also why are they doing a fancy flip and separate maneuver just after MaxQ. That whole plan never made sense to me. That’s literally the point in flight when there’s the most forces acting on the rocket. It’s like trying to do a kick flip on a hoverboard in a wind tunnel."
2-5-2-3-2,"It's how it is designed, it does a rotation and separates then sends the other component off at a different trajectory."
2-5-2-3-2-1,"[nope, the first stage was intended to flip after the seperation]"
2-5-2-3-2-1-2,"It's supposed to start it's flip, and then release Starship early in the rotation. The reason is because Starship/Super Heavy do not have any mechanical separating mechanics. 100% of the separation comes from rotational forces. Then, when Starship lights up (with a little bit of separation), it's engine plume helps rotate Super Heavy further.Since at least 6 engines went out (and likely more later), Starship didn't reach half of the altitude it was supposed to. I believe that the computers wouldn't let Starship release, as it hadn't met either it's staging velocity, or altitude. However, I do believe Starship tried to flip after a give time/propellant depletion. So I think it's a software discrepancy they can likely fix."
2-5-2-3-3,Why would it be risky? It's a very early unmanned flight over nothing but empty land and water? There is no hazard to people. Seeing a gigantic rocket tumble like that is incredible. Its amazing that it held together for its little loopty loops and didn't just tear itself apart.
2-5-2-3-3-2,"its just a question, usually stack separation just happens without a spin what is the reason for the spin but someone already answered the question to give the other component trajectory. I call it risky because its so heavy, of course its unmanned but if a spin is not needed why do it is what i meant."
2-5-2-3-3-2-1,"They replaced a bunch of complicated hydraulics with the spin, that's the idea. You'd need a massive force to push the huge booster away from the fully loaded ship, and that costs mass."
2-5-2-3-6,"It's supposed to start it's flip, and then release Starship early in the rotation. The reason is because Starship/Super Heavy do not have any mechanical separating mechanics. 100% of the separation comes from rotational forces.

However, I do believe Starship tried to flip after a give time/propellant depletion. So I think it's a software discrepancy they can likely fix."
2-6,"Literal KSP launch, would've been a hilarious launch had it continued after the flips xD"
2-6-1,I was surprised they let it spin that long before RUD'ing it.
2-6-1-2,"Well now they probably have a ton of data on the level of stress it can take from that, probably wouldn't have been able to get that data otherwise"
2-6-1-2-1,"Surprised the separation failed of all things. Expected other stuff might go wrong but not separation.But, tons of data, like you said. This thing is massive."
2-6-1-2-1-1,"Just an armchair theory, but if the separation is part of the hydraulic system and failed, it would explain loss of control and no separation."
2-6-1-2-1-1-1,Should've just said F it and lit the second stage engines...
2-6-1-2-1-1-1-1,"I don't think they'd have gotten any meaningful data from doing that, but it would've looked cool."
2-6-1-3,is it RUD if manually triggered?
2-6-1-3-3,Is it a RUD if you always expected it to blow up?
2-6-4,I need someone to edit in Bill and Bob freaking out while Jeb has the time of his life.
2-7,"The point where that turn kept going gave me major Kerbal vibes.Sad to see the detonation, but the data they'll have collected will be amazingly useful!"
2-7-1,Kinda surprised that it didn't break apart at that point.
2-7-1-1,Yeah I was surprised by how sturdy that giant silos is!
2-7-1-1-1,"Money well spent. Material science, 3D printing, experimental designs! Love science"
2-7-1-1-1-1,How long before they can do another test?
2-7-1-1-1-1-1,2-3 months minimum. You'll definitely see at least another test this year though.
2-7-1-1-1-1-1-2,"My guess is as long as it takes to build a flame diverted trench, probably the biggest take away from this test was the need to limit the shrapnel at launch. I really don’t know why they decided not to build one"
2-7-1-1-1-1-2,There are 2 starships with next gen engine ready for preparation. But do spacex still want to launch with same separation system?
2-7-1-1-1-3,One could argue if the vehicle can survive extreme off-nominal loads they are leaving some performance on the table from a mass perspective. Totally reasonable for an early prototype though.
2-7-1-1-1-4,What an astute comment u/wantsomepiss
2-7-1-1-1-4-1,"Hey don’t let the name fool ya, I’m more into cuddles and candle lit walks on the beach"
2-7-1-1-1-5,Didn't it explode?
2-7-1-1-1-6,Couldn't this money be spent on important issues on earth?
2-7-1-1-1-6-1,"Yeah, I mean, what has space exploration ever done for us? Aside from GPS, satellite communication networks, satellite imagery for maps, and [dozens of dozens of spinoff technologies that got their start in space exploration]."
2-7-1-1-1-7,"I'm sorry, didn't it blow up? If it was well spent, it would have done the job it was supposed to. Kinda like the self-driving aspect of the cars this guy's company makes."
2-7-1-1-1-7-2,"It did blow up.  The worlds largest rocket launched, cleared the launchpad, and got to an elevation where it could separate.  The separation failed, and the rocket exploded.That’s a fucking amazing first launch."
2-7-1-1-1-7-4,"Hey clown, are you aware that, thanks to spacex's falcon rocket and dragon capsule, NASA was able to ferry astronauts to the ISS for the first time since the retirement of the space shuttle? That previously NASA astronauts were hitching a ride with the Russians and their Soyuz capsule? That it came at an impeccable time just after Russia decided to go genocidal and destroy international relations for centuries? Read a book sometime."
2-7-1-1-1-8,Oh their structural folks are patting themselves on the back for sure.The autonomous flight termination people are probably sweating a bit. As soon as it started tumbling I assume main engine cutoff and a termination sequence should have occurred.
2-7-1-5,If anything this is a testament to how sturdy Starship is
2-7-1-5-1,I would have hit the Spacebar after the first attempted flip
2-7-1-5-1-4,I'm sure they're all hitting the space bar for a few drinks either way
2-7-4,Everyone harps on about the data but like what if someone just forgot to plug in the stage separator?
2-7-4-2,My wild speculation is that because they lost thrust in some engines they had less thrust and weren’t burning fuel as fast or climbing as quickly and somehow there was a timing mismatch between events. It seemed like maybe the booster started performing it’s flip while still burning and before the ship/ second stage separated. I’m amazed it all held together through those flips.
2-7-4-2-1,"I kind of doubt their control system is just a bunch of sleep() and if() statements, if they could have kept control they probably would have, but the engine losses were probably too much."
2-7-4-2-1-1,"I also doubt it’s sleep but there are definitely if statements. Maybe something like “at X altitude and Y speed, stage separate” but with the lost thrust it never reached that point. So either the tumble was caused by simply a loss of control authority (slightly more worrying) or a premature flip maneuver (embarrassing but easier to fix. happens to the best of us )"
3,SpaceX giant rocket fails minutes after launching from Texas | AP News
3-1,And by “failed” they mean exploded
3-1-1,Per SpaceX “rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation”
3-1-1-1,Special disassembling operation
3-1-1-1-1,Like Twitter(thanks for the award kind Redditor)
3-1-1-1-1-1,And the cyber truck window
3-1-1-1-1-1-2,This Musk guy might not be as great as his PR team would have us believe.
3-1-1-2,That may be the greatest euphemism I’ve ever run across.
3-1-1-2-1,"There are a few others like ""engine-rich exhaust"" and ""lithobraking maneuver"" that have come out of their team.  Funny stuff."
3-1-1-2-1-1,"Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly definitely predates SpaceX. I like engine-rich exhaust though, that's a good one that is theirs as far as I know."
3-1-1-2-1-1-2,This means the engine blew up?
3-1-1-2-1-1-2-2,More like consumed itself from the inside out
3-1-1-7,An unexpected fast escalation of entropy.
3-1-2,The rocket had already failed at stage separation before it exploded. The explosion itself was intentional to terminate the flight.
3-1-2-1,I was impressed they let it flip three times before pushing the explody button. Looked like the directional thrusters were working overtime trying to stabilize it.
3-1-2-1-1,They were probably letting it get lower to make the debris field smaller
3-1-2-1-1-1,"It’s also extremely useful to let it continue experiencing extreme stresses to evaluate the structural tolerances in the real world, refine any software controls."
3-1-2-1-1-3,The purpose of detonating a failed rocket is to burn off as much fuel as possible and disburse the remaining toxic fuel vapors so they are not concentrated enough to be lethal or seriously dangerous.
3-1-2-1-1-3-4,The idea is to have the large explosion happen at altitude instead of when it impacts the ground/water.  Also typically flight termination systems are typically designed to disperse fuel/oxidizer away from each other to allow the propellant to burn (relatively) slowly rather than detonate.  No clue if Starship/Superheavy utilized this method.
3-1-2-1-2,Is there really an explody button or did it explode on its own?
3-1-3,"They just changed the article title from ""failed"" to ""explodes""."
3-1-3-1,That’s because SpaceX considered anything after the initial lift off gravy. This is still in the testing stage and we may have a few more that are terminated before a fully successful flight.
3-1-3-2,"Which is actually more accurate, since the mission was a success.  The goal was to provide data, and not destroy the launch tower, and it succeeded at both."
3-1-3-3,"I'm very confused about the whole situation. Was it a fail, was it a success? You would assume an explosion of a rocket is something bad but everyone in YouTube is congratulating spaceX. Can someone with some knowledgd of aerospace engineering help me understand lol"
3-1-3-3-1,"This launch was just a test flight, there was no cargo on board and the only end goal was to almost get to orbit and then splash down in the ocean. This is the first time ever that the first stage has attempted to launch, and it was able to clear the launch pad and make it decently high before there were issues. Brand new rocket designs typically don’t work on the first attempt, so the fact that it made it through the launch sequence and through points of very high pressure means it was a success. Lots of data will be gathered and new versions of the rocket are already almost ready to launch."
3-1-3-3-2,"It’s a success.  It provided lots of data, especially about how the engines behave when they’re all firing together in real flight, and it didn’t destroy the launch facilities.It would have been *more* successful if the upper stage had been able to get to its near-orbit target and get data about reentry, but that doesn’t diminish what the flight accomplished."
3-1-4,I'm just surprised that it didn't have an emergency system to send out a poop emoji before it blew up.
3-1-4-1,What do you think the error logs are full of?
3-1-4-1-1,They call them LOGS for a shitty reason
3-1-4-2,Or a doge
3-1-5,Did the front fall off?
3-1-5-1,"No, that was the problem."
3-1-5-1-1,In all the old multistage rocket designs the front falls off and the booster stages fall harmlessly out of the environment.
3-1-5-1-1-1,"Except China's, they intentionally make the back of theirs fall off directly into the environment."
3-1-5-2,[For the entertainment of those who have not previously encountered this brilliant TV skit.
3-1-5-2-2,"I recently showed my wife this, and as a result I was awarded an additional 1000 hours of scrolling."
3-1-5-2-4,Hahaha this is perfect
3-1-5-3,"it's alright, it fell outside the environment."
3-1-6,[Obligatory Galaxy Quest]
3-1-6-1,"Thank you, that piping hot coffee really cleared out the sinuses!"
3-1-6-2,Thanks for this.  Was wondering if it turned inside out
3-1-7,"Between a rocket leaving the launch pad and reaching orbit, there aren’t really any failure modes that *don’t* involve an explosion."
3-1-7-1,"Weeeeellll, that isn't quite true - there are ways for the Falcon rockets to abort to ground (in theory), and if I recall correctly, it was possible for the Shuttle Orbiter to abort to ground (again, in theory, and the boosters would continue their own path), but yeah, in general, rockets are just one big explosion... either happening slowly, or quickly XD"
3-2,"Starship flipped 3 times while going 2000 kmph, stayed intact until she exploded."
3-2-4,"I mean, that was just impressive! I knew that wasn't part of the flight but I just sat there stunned it wasn't breaking apart!"
3-2-5,"I actually hadn't thought about this. That's actually impressive. Sounds like they got some kinks to work out. It'll probably be another 2-5 launches before they perfect everything. Keep in mind they keep re-iterating the Booster + Starship every time they build it atm. That was just an older model and it actually lifted off and did pretty good outside of the flipping/engines possibly damaged on take off and not lighting up, etc.Can't wait to see the next one in a month or so."
3-2-7,To be fair... dont all of them stay intact before they explode?
3-2-7-1,"no, actually not, many rockets crumble under their own structure if anything goes off course"
3-2-7-1-1," ""There was wreckage everywhere... then the explosion happened!"""
3-3,Sorry everyone that was just me playing Kerbal Space program again.
3-3-1,Watching that heavy ass rocket liftoff woke a bunch of old KSP memories involving rigs I built that were too heavy for their own good. The ones that worked ended up changing the space program though because of the payloads they could carry.
3-3-1-3,"While you were doing that, some guy [put a giant cube into space]."
3-3-1-3-1,"Robbaz and Scott Manley are the two best KSPers in my opinion. Scott provides the nitty gritty details, and Robbaz makes it endlessly entertaining even after you've made rocket launches feel mundane in a campaign."
3-3-2,That’s legit what it looked like. Spinning and flipping around all over the place. It was awesome. At least it made it through MAXQ
3-4,Didn't they say multiple times the hope is it launches in the first place worst case and separate best case scenario? Like they were fully expecting it to either explode one way or another even best case lol.
3-4-1,"Yes, clearing the tower and protecting the launch facility equipment was the number 1 goal.  Everything after that is just data."
3-4-1-1,"And they already have another booster and two other ships built and ready to go, and can crank out some more in a few weeks if need be. They're gonna blow a few more of these up before they get it right, that's why they're called ""tests."""
3-4-1-1-1,"Growing up on Florida’s Space Coast, I’ve always fully understood this. But watching that video, it’s still hilarious hearing the employees cheer so loud upon termination. "
3-4-1-1-1-1,Was watching Tim Dodd's livestream of it early this morning and he wasn't even sure it was going to launch.  He was about to leave and use the restroom when it lit.  They heard the boom from the explosion several minutes afterward and then after that they got covered in sand kicked up by the rocket.  Was pretty wild.
3-4-1-1-1-1-1,“Wild” is definitely a thread used throughout the SpaceX fabric. Certainly seems to be an important ingredient for pushing through old limitations and ideas. I’m here for it.
3-4-1-1-2,They will not be launching for many months. There’s a big crater under the launch mount. I highly doubt the launch stand is structurally sound
3-4-1-1-3,Musk tweeted that the next test will be in a couple months.  Hope they use that time to strengthen the launch pad surfacing better.
3-4-1-1-4,I thought a test was something you're supposed to pass.
3-4-1-1-5,Hasn’t NASA already figured out how to launch a spaceship and keep it intact for the duration of its flight?
3-4-1-1-5-4,We already know how to build cars and planes but they are  still tested lol. What a dumb take.
3-4-1-3,Sadly @CSI_Starbase isn't optimistic that they can re-launch this year due to the damage caused by not having a flame trench...
3-4-1-4,"Not sure if you saw, but chunks of said launch facility were tossed about like paper airplanes during launch.Sub-nominal indeed."
3-4-1-4-1,It happens during every test.  Damage from launch =/= Damage from 10.5 million pounds of propellant exploding.
3-4-1-4-1-2,"By the way, what's happening with that propellant right now? About to go read the article to see if it is just hanging out in the ocean but thought I'd ask someone in case it isn't mentioned."
3-4-1-4-1-2-1,"The Flight Termination System is set up to encourage the full combustion of the propellant, in this case the product of combustion is Water and CO2.Since the fuel is Liquid Oxygen (Boiling point of about -290F) and Liquid Methane (Boiling Point of -260F) anything that didn't combust wouldn't be sitting in the ocean, it would have vaporized in the air (into oxygen and methane gas).This rocket doesn't even carry any of the traditional toxic fuels like TEA-TEB for ignition or attitude (it uses electric ignition and compressed methane for thrusters).Outside of Hydralox fuel (which usually depends on dirty solid rocket boosters to help with launch), Methalox is the next cleanest rocket fuel around."
3-4-1-4-1-2-1-1,Hell yeah
3-4-1-4-5,3 of the engines failed at launch so there was probably a lot of 'extra' material blowing around.
3-4-1-5,"> Everything after that is just data.Well, that and a buncha scrap stainless steel."
3-4-1-7,"They failed that too then, because the launch pad and ground support equipment got *wrecked*."
3-4-1-8,Great way to piss away billions of dollars
3-4-1-8-1,People said stuff like this while they tested the Falcon 9.  Today the Falcon 9 delivers more payload to orbit than the rest of the world’s rockets combined.Today was a massive success.  In five years this version will lead the world in payload to orbit and you won’t even be impressed to see it land itself anymore.
3-4-1-8-2,"Billions?  These definitely don't cost a Billion, let alone multiple."
3-4-2,"[NYTimes described the explosion as intentional, after the second stage didn’t separate]"
3-4-2-1,"I figured that's what happened, separation was the last step of this test anyway and blowing up the rocket and having small pieces fall to the ground is a lot better than having a massive intact rocket hit the ground/ocean"
3-4-2-1-1,Well it wasn’t the *last* step — the plan included the upper stage making it around to the Pacific and reentry near Hawaii.  Getting data on how the heat shield behaved would have been nice.  But the data they got for the booster was a big win.
3-4-3,"Yep.   This was fully expected as a possible outcome and they still wanted to launch in order to get data.The rockets aren't all that expensive (in the world of rockets) and it's already old technology, so they didn't want it sitting around.   They've got more on the way that have lots of improvements."
3-4-3-2,"Is it really not that big a deal to destroy this stuff?  If SpaceX expected the launch to fail, they must have known that specific systems were likely to fail. Wouldn't it be cheaper to try to minimize failure chances before a test flight rather than building, moving, fueling, and launching a huge rocket just to see a 50/50 chance of explosion?"
3-4-3-2-1,">If SpaceX expected the launch to fail, they must have known that specific systems were likely to fail. Wouldn't it be cheaper to try to minimize failure chances before a test flight rather than building, moving, fueling, and launching a huge rocket just to see a 50/50 chance of explosion?That's more or less the strategy NASA uses. Problem with trying to engineer the entire rocket perfectly on paper before a single test launch is it takes years longer and ends up being far more expensive as a result. Turns out you learn more and faster building rockets and blowing them up than you do navel gazing over a piece of paper."
3-4-3-2-2,"It might be cheaper, but cheaper isn't necessarily SpaceX's goal.SpaceX is either beginning to make money off Starlink or will be there soon, but they're reaching capacity faster than they can launch satellites. They also have a new Starlink design that can only launch on Starship.For the company, the drive right now is to get Starship operational so they can begin deploying those new satellites and make money. Throwing a couple of boosters into the ocean is absolutely worth it from a cost/benefit viewpoint if your overriding priority is ""make ship fly.""Besides, they already have several boosters and starships built and almost ready to fly; you launch this one, learn everything you can from the launch, and then you apply what you've learned to the next one and hope to learn new things from that launch; repeat until orbit achieved."
3-4-3-2-3,"Idk why you’re getting downvoted, this is a totally fair question for people who don’t do fucking space shuttle engineering. And it will benefit people to know why this type of result might be expected, and the testing would be performed anywayGiven the expense of the rocket, it’s very likely there are specific pieces of data they want from the experiment. From my understanding, you can’t think of these projects like, say, software updates, where you can just roll back to a previous version. As these things are produced, and more importantly assembled, they become very very difficult to try to redesign.Pair that with the need for certain pieces of flight data, especially data that the engineering team wants within the context of a full attempted flight, rather than isolated testing, and it becomes clear that this type of field testing is not only beneficial, but necessary, for completing their spacecraft"
3-4-3-2-4,"It's all about data gathering. If something unexpected fails they get data from it, if certain parts hold up better than expected they get data from it. The idea is to test to destruction (literally), they often show b-roll of all the attempts up to that point blowing up as a prelude on their streams."
3-4-3-3,"I don't want to be part of any space program where an entire rocket flipping while at ludicrous speed (TM) is ""fully expected as a possible outcome"" to the point that it has to be destroyed ""after spinning out of control"".""Was considered a rare but not unfathomable possibility"" - sure.""Highly unlikely"" - maybe.""Fully expected"" - Fuck off with your expensive commercial death-trap.Launch failures are fine, common, etc. but EXPECTING to sacrifice one of the largest rockets ever launched, in its entirety, in 2023... nope.You shouldn't be beta-testing things that cost billions to build and burn stupendous amounts of fuel at this point, and certainly not because it literally ended up ""out of control"".Launch it with a tiny amount of fuel deliberately (make up the payload if you like with dummy weight), tell everyone you will terminate exactly 30 seconds after launch.  That's ""expected"".""Out of control"" is not ""expected""."
3-4-4,Is there something different about this rocket that they are experimenting with that makes exploding the best case scenario? I’m not too familiar with their launch history.
3-4-5,"Yup, this is still a huge success for the engineers of SpaceX."
3-4-5-1,I'm making a note here: huge success.
3-4-5-1-2,You just keep on trying to you run out of boosters
3-4-5-4,"Yup, Gwynne Shotwell and her team did outstanding work."
3-4-5-4-1,Gwynne Shotwell is responsible for the operational side of the business; development and testing is under Elon's purview.
3-4-5-4-1-1,"Ah, typical Elon ass-kissing."
3-4-5-5,Haven’t we been launching rockets into space for 70-ish years now? Why would simply getting this one off the ground count as a success?
3-4-5-5-1,"this is the tallest and most powerful launch vehicle ever flown.and that aside, anytime there's a brand new rocket, it's hardly a gaurantee it gets off the ground on the very first test flight. turns out rockets are very, very complicated."
3-4-5-5-2,"Not sure why nobody else has mentioned this.Tldr; it's designed to be a reusable rocket for long-distance spaceflight. Reusable means the same booster and spaceship will fly back down and land to be refurbished and refuelled (ideally rapidly in the future). It will drastically reduce the cost of spaceflight. It will also make multi-stage missions more possible.Pretty important tech advancement imo and so far, SpaceX has been a massive market disrupter in the spaceflight (satellite) industry."
3-4-5-5-2-1,That’s pretty cool!
3-4-5-5-6,I think you are severely underestimating the extreme complexity involved with launching a rocket of this size. Especially when it is all an experimental design. All it takes is one minor configuration or parameter to not be absolutely perfect for the entire thing to unravel. It’s amazing that we have the success rate we do with rocket launches.
3-4-5-5-7,"Because we're not launching the *same* rockets from 70 years ago. This is a brand new, huge rocket. Almost every part of it is new or unique in some way. They are incredibly complex and they have to test it extensively to understand how it all works together and what changes are needed"
3-4-5-5-7-1,"some failure is expected with something so new. To quote the wise Professor Farnsworth ""Science cannot move forward without heaps!"""
3-4-5-5-7-1-1,"More specifically the way SpaceX operates is rapid cycling over prototypes until the prototype evolves into something that works consistently.Fail fast, fail hard, and fail controllably with good telemetry to figure out what went wrong. It’s how a lot of software companies operate, and one of the differentiating factors between SpaceX and other space companies. NASA spends a lot more time doing experimentation and simulation without blowing up prototypes, but SpaceX takes a different approach and tries and fail fast in a different way."
3-4-6,"It left the tower, the pad and the tower survived, the vehicle survived MAXq, and it survived all of those flips until it was terminated by the FTS. It was a pretty darn good test, especially considering the vehicle was already meant to splash down and not survive, and the next booster is already significantly more upgraded than booster 7. Plus they have a bunch of data now to comb through."
3-4-7,"It’s still a bummer. Of all of Musk’s companies, this one is the one I root for."
3-4-7-1,"Can’t, absolutely can’t stand Musk, but I really respect the work SpaceX is doing. I’m sure there are lots of people at SpaceX doing the heavy lifting who are not narcissistic dicks."
3-4-7-1-1,Gwynne Shotwell is COO. Listening to her speak she does not strike me as a megalomaniac
3-4-7-1-2,"Like you said, it's best to understand that there are more than 1,000 of the world's best engineers making this happen.  It's true that this would never have happened without SpaceX—the prospect of working at Boeing or a similarly lethargic space-oriented company is _not_ what drives this kind of enthusiasm—but those are the folks who are making it happen."
3-4-7-3,"This isn't a bummer. The whole point of this test flight was to just see if they could get the rocket to clear the tower. Everything after that was bonus. I bet they've got real rocket scientists combing through the data to see how to improve. And hopefully it'll be a relatively quick turn around before they get another one to fly. Hell, they've got at least one booster ready to go and a starship or 2 either done or real close."
3-4-7-4,May all the rocket gods bless and protect Gwynne Shotwell.
3-4-7-5,"I root for the mission, but not the company.I want SpaceX to fail but for the brilliant people and all of their technological advancements and innovations to be brought into NASA, so that space exploration is once again the province of the people and something we can all feel a part of, as opposed to it being another one of Elon Musk’s vanity projects."
3-4-7-5-1,"Unfortunately the number of people going ""hurr durr rocket explode"" is why it's better for this to happen in the private sector.  Today's test was a success but imagine it's publicly funded and everyone is calling their congressman/senator complaining about money being spent on failures.  Now, even though your test was successful you're getting your funding pulled by congress because of people who don't understand what's going on."
3-4-7-5-1-2,"You're right.  And yet, it so rarely goes the other way:  All we've heard about for years was the wastefulness of the SLS.  Well, they completed their mission, and even then, they'll never stop being criticizesd  Starship blows up again and it's all praise, back patting, and giggling about funny tweets."
3-4-7-5-1-2-1,"You are missing / ignoring the background and history of the two rockets. SLS has been under development for way way longer than Starship and cost a lot more both in development and per-launch costs. They just prefer to do test flights later in the development cycle than SpaceX, who do flight tests early on.The whole point is that these early flight tests help accelerate the development by identifying issues and also help the team figure out how to build said rocket. The drawback is that failures are quite public (see this thread) and if NASA does that they would be crucified by the public. SpaceX can do that because ultimately they don’t have congressmen breathing down their neck. Having these early failures help them make the overall project safer, and also cheaper in the long run.It is possible to test everything extensive so you can just launch and be successful on the first try like SLS. It’s just not the most efficient way to develop."
3-4-7-6,Stop. It's literally privatized nasa. They produce insane amount of Co2 with no upside. The only tangibly useful thing they've done is starlink and it's got to be one of the worst ideas ever conceived. The failure rate on a starlink satellite over two years is something close to 30% iirc and they're all planned to come down after 5. Consider all the launches ( and Co2 release ) required to maintain that fleet / swarm.
3-4-7-6-1,"If you'd been following along, you'd know that the vehicle that was tested today runs on methalox which can be created from atmospheric CO2. All you need is solar panels, CO2 and H2O. It's 100% carbon neutral (as soon as they build the methalox production facilities).The reason for this is that they plan to refuel this vehicle on *Mars* and there's no fossil fuels there to use. You should really inform yourself before you spout off."
3-4-7-6-1-1,This is Reddit... don't expect to find intelligence in popular subreddits.
3-4-7-6-1-2,"As soon as they build it lolAlso the actual math on ""producing it on mars"" is a fucking clown show. Hell any of this mars talk is a clown show. Mr. ""Radiation isn't a problem"""
3-4-7-6-1-2-1,"They haven't built the facilities yet because, until today, the vehicle literally had never flown. It'd be like building the first gasoline distillation facility before you even verify that a car can run on gas. There's a long term plan and it's not their fault that you're not up to date. Scoffing at the plan two seconds after learning about it also isn't a great look."
3-4-7-6-1-2-1-1,"Uh, once again I have actually seen the data on doing this on mars, I've seen the energy and mining requirements for the ice. What in the world are you on about ""two seconds after learning about it""Solar on mars runs at a fraction of the efficiency of earth, the energy required to heat, keep the water heated then perform electrolysis would be immense.  Once again, I've actually seen numbers on this lmao. I'm not surprised that someone that thinks SpaceX going near Mars is unconcerned with data though.Elon is very good with absurd plans. Read the Hyperloop white paper, it did a good job of shitting on the laws of physics lol."
3-4-7-6-2,"I cannot speak on Starlink's pollution or failure rate as I am not familiar with that information, but coming from rural Appalachia Starlink has hooked up many people with somewhat decent internet that didn't have it before. Some areas still have dial up here because companies simply won't run the lines to such remote places. It has been a game changer for sure here.EDIT: let me also put a disclaimer that I am not a Musk stan."
3-4-7-6-2-1,"I'm from KY originally and spent a ton of my life on Direct TV sattelite internet. The speed is actually comperable with Starlink where demand is the same, or close, where starlink excels is low-latency. They're able to do this by flying their sattelites at a much lower altitude. Less altitude = less distance for signal to travel = less latency. Unfortunately, because they're close to the ground, there is less of a projection range, which means that each sattelites covers a lot less area. This means you need a ton of them, hence the ""swarm"". A single traditional sattelites can support thousands of users over a huge space, and can stay in orbit for a decade or more. The starlink swarms require constant replacement. So, I understand the appeal which is why I called it out as ""tangibly useful"" but it's an unsustainable solution to something the government should provide to rural areas."
3-4-7-6-2-1-1,"Hey, I'm from KY too! Where I lived there was only one internet provider. Thankfully it is fiber and high speed, but DTV satellite internet was not offered where I lived growing up. I didn't know that its speeds are comparable to DTV. I have a friend in Morehead whose only option was 5 Mbps from a single company until Starlink finally went live in the area. Like I said in my edit, I'm not a Musk fan and judging by your username we'd probably agree on a lot of things. Just speaking from my experience in rural Kentucky it has provided somewhat decent internet for those who did not have it previously. Admittedly, I was not aware of the upkeep (or lack of) for Starlink's fleets. I see why it is an unsustainable solution."
3-4-7-6-3,"Without SpaceX the US would have no way of ferrying astronauts to space except through Russian rockets. You think that’s better??I suggest actually reading up on the history of SpaceX and the new space movement and commercial crew/cargo resupply, and also the failure of the Constellation project (pushed by the Bush administration).With starship the starlink launches are actually also not going to be producing that much CO2 compared to quite a lot of other pollution source. The failure rate you quoted is also inaccurate."
3-4-8,Exploding on the launch pad is the worst scenario as you lose the pad as well.  In this case they saved the launch pad and got a ton of data as well. The second starship already has lots of upgrades and the learnings of this launch will no doubt be acted on.
3-5,"""SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) — SpaceX’s giant new rocket blasted off on its first test flight Thursday but failed minutes after rising from the launch pad.Elon Musk’s company launched the nearly 400-foot (120-meter) Starship rocket from the southern tip of Texas, near the Mexican border. The plan called for the booster to peel away and plummet into the Gulf of Mexico shortly after liftoff, with the spacecraft hurtling ever higher toward the east in a bid to circle the world, before crashing into the Pacific near Hawaii."""
3-5-1,Timestamped at T-10s to launch: 
3-5-1-1,“Everything after clearing the tower is -“Explodes“- icing on the cake.”
3-5-1-1-1,"""this cake tastes burnt...."""
3-5-1-1-1-1,"“This cake is like a party in my mouth, and everyone just died horribly in an explosion…”"
3-5-1-3,SpaceX launch live stream successful: SpaceX team whoops and cheers wildy.SpaceX  launch live stream unsuccessful: SpaceX team whoops and cheers wildy.I think Elon requires 6 months to fix his AI bot algorithms.
3-5-2,Failure after failure has to be eating up Mr Narcissist. I wonder where he will direct his next tantrum?  Maybe whiteout PAC on SpaceX's corporate sign!
3-5-2-1,"Don't think this one was a failure, in that, it accomplished its mission (get off the pad, don't blow up on the mission control center), and everything past that is just bonus. I mean, I still hope Elon falls off a cliff, but SpaceX did say this one was just hoped it didn't blow up *on the pad*."
3-5-2-1-1,"I may have jumped the gun a bit. Seems like a lot of narrative battle going on and I'm not super knowledgeable about rocketry. I should have kept my comment to myself instead of just assuming something based on my limited knowledge... Jeez, maybe me and old Musky boy have more in common than I realized!!!"
3-5-2-1-1-1,"Doesn't help you that every article about it is ""ROCKET FAILS!!!!"" when they clearly stated what the mission success parameters were before launch, and it passed that."
3-5-2-1-1-1-1,"Much like a news report that ""NASA's Mars Rover fails and deemed unrecoverable""Doesn't let you know it survived 14 years vs 90 day expectation. This launch was a technical success (obviously some of the initial boosters appeared to [not do so hot]). But they didn't get to test the separation (or did under crappy conditions which failed, I can't quite tell), which would probably have sped up development. So they got further than feared, but not as far as hoped. I'm sure they'll present it as a success.Every successful version of this test would have seen the rocketship completely destroyed, so... definitely a more exciting way to do itSpaceX has always felt that it is faster to rush out and blow up some unmanned rockets and rebuild with the real life data vs NASAs slow safe crawl (which in fairness.... has still had its share of deadly manned failures)"
3-5-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, it's a shame that spacex suffers from the regrettable association with musk but they do seem to be pushing the technology and that's cool. Failures are to be expected, especially dealing with hardcore stuff like explosives and gravity, and no-one died. Hopefully they gained valuable data."
3-5-2-1-1-1-2,It's a lot like those few years of Falcon 9 landing attempts about 10 years ago. It was something like a year or two after their first landing that they stopped referring to it as a test or experimental landing attempt.
3-5-2-1-1-2,"Glad you at least had the sense to acknowledge you jumping the gun unlike a lot of people. This was actually considered a success. The tallest, heaviest most powerful rocket the world has ever seen just launched. They wanted it to clear the launch pad and reach Max Q. Termination of the rocket was expected at some point. So many people just assumed because it blew up it was a failure. They have so much data now for the next test. I'd call that a success."
3-5-2-1-1-3,"> it accomplished its mission (get off the pad, don't blow up on the mission control center)I thought the mission was one orbit around Earth and splashdown near Hawaii.The head engineer himself even said the explosion and crash were ""unscheduled"" or some such euphemismThere's a difference between ""gleaned useful test data"" and ""mission accomplished."""
3-5-2-1-1-3-1,"> I thought the mission was one orbit around Earth and splashdown near Hawaii.That'd have been the ideal outcome, but SpaceX themselves said that was very unlikely. So getting it off the pad without blowing up (pad is still in some mess going by initial photos), making it through max-Q and getting loads of data is a solid win."
3-5-2-1-1-4,"You didn't jump the gun. Idk whats going on in this thread, but the article kinda lays it out?""Elon Musk’s company was aiming to send the nearly 400-foot (120-meter) Starship rocket on a round-the-world trip from the southern tip of Texas, near the Mexican border. It carried no people or satellites.""""The flight plan had called for the booster to peel away from the spacecraft minutes after liftoff, but that didn’t happen. The rocket began to tumble and then exploded four minutes into the flight, plummeting into the gulf.""So, yes, the rocket failed, they had other success parameters that weren't met and the explosion was unintended."
3-5-2-1-2,Not the highest bar they could've set.At least they are being realistic?
3-5-2-1-2-1,"I mean, they've made 6 starships and 3 boosters since this stack (Ship 24/booster 7). In fact, this stack was pretty outdated already (the newer systems use electric control instead of hydraulic, for example).They literally just wanted to get rid of the stack and free up the next flight articles- just without blowing up all the expensive pad infrastructure."
3-5-2-1-2-1-1,"> instead of hydraulicLooks like one of the hydraulic power units blew up, so it's good they're getting rid of that. Those have always been problematic on Starship it seems."
3-5-2-1-4,He should still be charged with littering though. He looooooves dumping things into waterways.
3-5-2-3,failure is good for SpaceX. they will learn from it and try again.
3-5-2-5,This dude actually thought he'd have people living on Mars by now...
3-5-2-5-2,[As his indentured servants.]FREE MARS
3-5-2-6,"This kid should learn what iterative testing means, and stay off the internet until then."
3-5-2-6-2,Typically iterative testing occurs on something expendable since the likelihood of failure is high. Unless your implying that Starship is disposable.
3-5-2-7,"Everyone went into this one knowing there was at least a 50/50 shot of it going boom.Honestly, it flew pretty gud. Next one will probably go boom also. I wouldn't expect a really successful test until like number 3 or 4."
3-6,"""That was the most kerbal launch i have ever seen!"" Couldn't have said it better myself."
3-6-1,"Hahaa right, I loved how almost speechless all of them were after"
3-7,"Anyone here who thinks this is a failed test doesn't understand the term ""integration hell"". A lot went right. The interface between the launch pad and first stage was successful. The launch tower was proven to be appropriately engineered to the monumental task of surviving the launch of the world's most powerful rocket. The integrated vehicle maintained stable flight until its first stage ran out of propellant.But something went wrong during stage separation. This is data SpaceX wouldn't have if separation was successful. The engineers are probably already looking at the data feed and comparing it to simulations, videos and pre-launch inspection records to find the cause of the failure to separate so they can fix it.This is where we *want* to see explosions. Before people are ever onboard. They know how the vehicle will react in this scenario, and they can even start planning for crew survival in the event this ever happens during a crewed launch.That said, fuck Elon."
3-7-1,"I bet it won't launch again until the water deluge system is in place. You could see the sound waves ricocheting up around the second stage before the finally released it from the pad. Ideally, you don't want those sound waves bouncing back up. It was madness to launch this time without it, but I still appreciate the spectacle. But next launch definitely needs more dampening. That couldn't have done those engines or the OLM any favors."
3-7-3,"I really hate this whole ""I hate Elon and therefore SpaceX must have failed"" kind of mentality Reddit has sometimes. The company has clearly communicated multiple times (and during the stream) that this is a test and the most important thing is to not blow up at launch site, and not damage any equipment or hurt anyone. Getting this far was genuinely a decent result (obviously not perfect but hey I bet no one's life is perfect either).Sometimes people just seem to default to a tribal attitude and use that to short-circuit critical thoughts and that really bugs me."
3-7-3-4,"Elon has proven to be a hateful little man very recently and that is fresh in everyone’s minds. They want his ventures to fail so he fails and goes away.I think Elon has shown who he truly is as a person, but I’m not going to say “yo fuck the space program now, too!”"
3-7-3-5,"Not at all what the comment you were replying to was saying, but I guess still a reasonable comment to make that can stand on its own because the sentiment you’re addressing isn’t exactly rare. I do think it’s kind of unfortunate that Elon is involved at all though. These attempts are successful because of the dedicated engineers involved, he really adds nothing positive as far as I can see. It’s like he finds spaces where he can take advantage of people who will pour themselves into the work, and then tries to figurehead himself onto it. Sucks to see."
3-7-3-5-1,Not accrediting any success to SpaceX because of Elon is bonkers
3-7-3-5-1-2,"It seems to me that PayPal, SpaceX, Twitter, all are examples of people (Peter Thiel, passionate aerospace engineers who pour themselves into their work, “hardcore Twitter engineers”) whose hard work Elon characterizes himself as being deserving of credit for. I’m willing to be corrected though, why do you think I’m off base? A couple of examples that come to mind for me is him wanting to run PayPal on windows, and thinking a full rewrite of the Twitter codebase is the best strategic course of action. Again, open to different perspectives."
3-7-3-5-1-2-1,SpaceX literally would not exist if not for Elon's personal capital infusion.
3-7-3-6,"It's more that this is a waste of tax money to keep subsidizing him in this venture. He and private investors can do whatever they want with their time and money, but we have NASA. They already went through all of this shit 60 years ago. While they aren't perfect, they are literally decades beyond this. Take the money going to SpaceX and give it to NASA... Let them put rovers on mars, or take more pictures of Pluto or other planets, or make whatever telescope comes after james webb. Or any other ""crazy"" ideas they might want to do. Let's fix the Aricebo Radio telescope...or simply use the money to feed/house some homeless people? Nah, let's let him play tony stark some more."
3-7-3-7,"Given the way Elon runs twitter and tesla, I don't think it's a leap to assume that he's pressuring engineers and rushing things. I want to see manned spaceflight pushed forward, but I fully believe that as long as Elon is involved in it, eventually we will see a tragedy involving loss of life that will set things back worse than any of the space shuttle disasters. It seems fairly inevitable"
3-7-3-7-1,Spacex Crew dragon has been America's only crew launch service for a few years. ULA who started at the same time with a contract bid for more money is way behind and can't get their capsule to pass Nasa's safety criteria which Spacex did. Elon has said he doesn't think this new Starship will launch crew till after 100 un-manned flights which might not take very long of they get the reusability right and they plan on building a lot of them. Nasa believes in Spacex and the legacy contractor ULA keeps disappointing them.
3-7-3-7-2,"I can kind of see the sentiment but it's not really reflected in the reality where Crew Dragon has been successfully ferrying astronauts to space and back and NASA is so far pretty happy with them. It's hard to overstate how much oversight NASA has on the project because ultimately they are the customer.Either way, as the other comment said, having things blow up early in test flights is a good thing to iron out the kinks, before you start putting valuable payload (e.g. humans) on them."
3-7-3-7-2-1,"> Either way, as the other comment said, having things blow up early in test flights is a good thing to iron out the kinks, before you start putting valuable payload (e.g. humans) on them.Literally everybody knows this. I'm not refuting this. I'm not suggesting that the explosion today was unnatural in the course of rocket development. I'm telling you that if Elon is in charge, he will push unrealistic deadlines, he will lie to NASA, he will commit fraud, and he will get people killed."
3-7-3-7-2-1-1,"NASA did exactly that in the 1960s. SpaceX has always approached manned flight with safety as the number one priority, and they have said they want to fly Starship 100 times before manning it (probably optimistic in my opinion but it’s not unreasonable). Your claims are completely baseless."
3-7-4,"Current speculation is that the hydraulic controller failed along with several Raptors on ascent. The failure to separate could have been on purpose as they wanted to test the flip, but keep the whole vehicle together to self destruct together.Also, fuck Elon , praise Gwen Shotwell"
3-7-4-2,"I did notice that by T+1:10 a few Raptors had failed (it looked like 5), but they have multiple redundant engines and the vehicle continued accelerating, so I wasn't too concerned about it.It was only at around T+2:30 (give or take ten seconds) that I became concerned that stage separation hadn't occurred yet. Up until that point everything looked nominal. And a few seconds after that, it started to tumble as if it were in an unstable freefall.Of course, my subjective opinion on a video that doesn't show everything you'd need to come to a conclusion isn't exactly holy gospel. I'm definitely looking forward to a thorough analysis by the experts on what happened."
3-7-4-4,"> The failure to separate could have been on purpose as they wanted to test the flipWow, that is insightful.  Could very well be.  It definitely didn't make sense to me that something as relatively unsophisticated as a few clamps (or whatever) ended up being what stopped the show."
3-7-7,Well said. Most definitely fuck Elon but I support the thousands of people putting in the actual work on this project and I support the project itself.
3-8,Clearly some of y’all weren’t around in the early days of the space program to witness all the disastrous crashes and explosions.  This was a test flight to gather data to be built upon later on.  Put aside your politics and celebrate what’s trying to be achieved.
3-8-1,"You don't even have to go that far back. Look at SpaceX 10 years ago trying to land a rocket. I saw a lot of similar comments after each test about how it clearly wouldn't ever work and the whole idea was stupid and the company was going to go under...Starship could ultimately fail, but I think it's foolish to be claiming that right now."
3-8-1-2,SpaceX even celebrates all those failures - [How Not to Land an Orbital Rocket Booster]
3-8-1-2-1,"Oh for sure, they even celebrated today's failure. It was funny listening to the silence as the rocket tumbled out of control, then it exploded and everyone started cheering.They're a goofy bunch. It's great."
3-8-2,"I was surprised it made it as far as it did. As far as I know, this was the first test of the full stack. That’s a success in my book. They will work these issues out and this rocket will be revolutionary. I think the Falcon 9 failed it’s first three flights and is now the most reliable rocket in the world, and flies more than any other rocket as well. SpaceX knows how to build rockets that’s for sure.Edit: Correction. It was Falcon 1 that had the failures, not Falcon 9. Thanks to everyone for correcting that mistake. Not trying to spread misinformation, I just mixed those details up"
3-8-2-1,">I think the Falcon 9 failed it’s first three flightsThat was the Falcon 1, the test bed for Falcon 9.Falcon 9's success (both reliability, and cost) is largely due to it's reusability, and that took 6 years of launches to work out.  Now it's expected."
3-8-2-1-1,Falcon 9 also had some small issues. Like the cracked engine bell where they just trimmed off a part of it as a quick fix.
3-8-2-1-1-1,"Yes, small issues here and there, but still a higher mission success rate than even ULA over it's lifetime.  Having the first stage back to inspect for wear or potential failure points was a massive boon for it's development."
3-8-2-2,"The media always jumps on the ""it failed and blew up"" bandwagon on these types of tests.SpaceX publicly said multiple times that just clearing the launch pad would make this mission a success. Everything beyond that was just bonus data. To anybody that has been paying attention to SpaceX test launches it was expected it would go boom. SpaceX's entire engineering process is summarized as 'test often, fail quickly, learn and improve' - that's one of the big reasons why they are the most successful rocket company in the world."
3-8-2-2-1,"Yup. Explosions are supposed to happen. Hell Relativity just had their first rocket blow up too, and that was considered a resounding success since it was the first partially 3D printed rocket, and it made past Max Q. Rocket Lab has had failures too, but all these new space companies are revolutionizing the industry. Hell the European Vega rocket just blew up and that rocket has a very successful track record for years"
3-8-2-3,"I wasn't particularly hopeful it'd make it through Max-Q without disintegrating, but it did that then flipped around sideways several times afterwards and still didn't disintegrate. Clearly it's a really sturdy vehicle structurally, even if there's other issues to be addressed."
3-8-2-5,Yeah i was honestly surprised it went that far considering engines were flaming out and even exploding along the way lmao. Not to mention the shower of debris blown up by the initial launch
3-8-3,It’s disappointing that Musk is tied to SpaceX forever. Where once I looked at them with pride and fascination now all I see is a monument to a billionaire neckbeard’s ego. It sucks.
3-8-4,I am completely uninformed. Was it sent up just to gather data and then intentionally blown up?
3-8-4-1,"Yes. It was just supposed to survive a bit longer and then splash into the ocean around Hawaii but because of the raptor engine failures the vehicle was out of control so they had to activate the flight termination sequence. They still gathered significantly valuable data and the next vehicle is already vastly more upgraded, plus they can now implement more improvements to the next vehicle using that data."
3-8-4-3,"The mission was a success by any metric. The only stuff that didn’t go as hoped for was the separation step. It started losing control before that. But nobody at SpaceX thought the whole mission would be a success. The point was to launch and collect data. Today marks the true beginning of 21st century space travel. And as per usual, the mainstream media ghouls are trying to smear SpaceX. As they always have. Despite the endless accomplishments."
3-8-6,What do politics have to do with any of this?
3-8-6-1,"Reddit isn't a fan of Musk due to his politics, SpaceX is owned by Musk, join the dots."
3-8-6-1-1,"I feel like fans of Musk's approach to Twitter only like him because of his politics, as opposed to his detractors who hate him for valid reasons. It's hard to defend any decision he made in regard to Twitter from an economic standpoint, an ethical standpoint, or any internally coherent perspective. He's made so many of the things he complained about at Twitter worse and less accountable."
3-8-6-1-1-1,"I'm not a fan of Musk's inconsistency and not a fan of all of Twitter's content moderation choices, but I am a major fan of ""no government agency or affiliated organization influencing content moderation, beyond duly passed laws enforced through public court proceedings"" and ""publishing prior examples where the above occurred"".I think this is a decision that is defensible from a consistent ethical and legal perspective."

4-2,i live 20 miles away from the starbase and we were able to hear the actual explosion. It’s wild
4-2-1,Did debris hit anything
4-2-1-2,"No, the flight path was designed so any failure would happen over the gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic, so debris will have only fallen there. I also imagine space X will do a thorough cleanup after this kind of thing."
4-2-1-2-1,You've just given me a new rabbit hole to consume the next few hours of my day lol I'm going to research to what level of the ocean do NASA/SpaceX etc recover debris. I'd imagine there's pieces that fall deeper and the cost is just not worth it.
4-2-1-2-1-2,I mean I don't actually know but I imagine there is definitely some required cleanup :P.
4-2-3,"Isn’t this going to happen more regularly now? Sounds cool now but could be the equivalent of living next to the train tracks in 10 years. I guess it will need to be one a day to be truly annoying, but still worth thinking about!"
4-2-3-1,"If Starships are exploding that often in 10 years, SpaceX wont exist for long"
4-3,"""We have experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly."""
4-3-1,Only an engineer could come up with a name like that.
4-3-1-1,That engineer has experience dropping his Lego down the stairs
4-3-1-1-1,Followed by pediatric insertion of the foot
4-3-2,NO DISASSEMBLE
4-3-5,"In layman's terms, ""That was one heck of a firework!"""
4-3-7,"At least it's more honest than the term ""hard start"""
4-3-8,And everybody cheered.
4-3-8-1,Like a mad cult.
4-4,"As the starship and booster tumbled after release failure, desperately trying to compensate and fly straight again,it looked uncannily like some of my early Kerbal Space Program attempts."
4-4-1,"For sure, Scott Manley had a good explanation for the likely cause of the spin. I have done the exact think in KSP many times."
4-4-1-1,been having this issue a lot in ksp2 with large rockets. just need to add some big ol fins on the first stage
4-4-1-1-2,You guys seem surprised.  How do you think they developed the rocket in the first place?  Apparently KSP2's physics doesn't work the same as RL but they'll work it out for next time.
4-4-1-2,Is there a video of the explanation or was it a comment somewhere?Edit: Found the [thread]
4-4-1-2-1,It was just a short Twitter thread shortly after the launch
4-4-3,… revert to launch or revert to VAB?
4-4-3-1,"More often than not, VAB, and then realising it’s a simple staging issue"
4-4-3-1-1,"definitely VAB. you think it's the *pilot's* fault? no, I didn't think so either."
4-4-3-1-1-1,There’s a pilot left?!
4-5,They said that anything other than the complete destruction of the launch pad was a major success. Expensive maybe but the price to pay to validate and iterate the rocket that will bring the first people to mars! “Great success” - Borat
4-5-1,It’s all a sham - Murph
4-5-2,Brining people to Mars or the Afterlife
4-5-2-1,Can you be brined to Mars? How much salt do you need for that?
4-5-2-1-2,Probably about two
4-5-2-1-2-1,2 salts?
4-5-2-1-2-1-1,"I'm not so sure, that's 2 salty 4 me"
4-5-2-2,"True. Given the amount of time it takes to travel to Mars from liftoff, there will be a number of people on earth who watch liftoff that will die before the astronauts reach their destination. Weird to think like that but it is reality."
4-5-2-2-1,"think you might be confusing mars with alpha centuri, bud"
4-5-2-2-1-1,"think you might be confusing alpha centuri with alpha centauri, bud"
4-5-2-2-1-2,You really don’t think that a few people on earth will die on earth in seven months. Hell I went to a college football game once during which two people died in three hours. I’m not saying the astronauts will die. I’m saying that it isn’t going to be like an Apollo mission.
4-5-2-2-1-2-2,I bet a bunch of people died during the time it took to write this. So either way you’re *technically correct
4-5-2-2-6,I'm sorry to hear your lifespan is measured in months.
4-5-4,>bring the first people to marsDon't hold your breath on that.
4-5-4-1,Versus what other rocket family?
4-5-4-1-1,"At the moment, none. Starship can't do it."
4-5-4-1-1-1,Only Elon Musk could suck all the joy out of the prospect of space travel.
4-5-4-1-1-1-3,The people in these comments prove that all this effort is misplaced. We're spending billions of tax dollars to send a handful of people to another planet when we can't even take care of our own and the launches themselves cause additional atmospheric degradation.As a species were simply not mature enough to wield the tools we're messing with and millions of people are going to pay with their lives.
4-5-4-1-1-2,Needleroozer on Reddit knows more than the literal rocket scientists working on it.
4-5-4-1-1-2-1,"Name one existing rocket that can orbit people around Mars and return them to Earth. Forget landing then overcoming Mars' gravety well, just orbit Mars then bring them home. Name one.Even if Starship worked perfectly it can't do that."
4-5-4-1-1-2-1-4,>Even if Starship worked perfectly it can't do that.Ahem? Yes it would?
4-5-4-2,We should try the one you engineered and financed next.
4-5-4-3,"Before 2050 easily. Humanity needs to be able to expand, and we won’t really know what is on Mars until we can get human boots on the ground. Probes and Robots only do so much. Space exploration drives everything Elon Musk does , right down to Twitter (political hedging)."
4-5-5,"> Expensive maybe but the price to pay to validate and iterate the rocket that will bring the first people to mars!Given that every rocket to date has been unreusable, by definition, figuring out how to launch and land something reuseable will be massive."
4-5-5-2,This isn’t even remotely true. SpaceX has been landing rockets for years.
4-5-6,Can’t believe people still think anyone but the ultra rich are getting to mars
4-5-7,"Sounds like a whole lot of spin, and the applause  m breakup felt scripted aka “guys, if it explodes, immediately cheer like we wanted to actually lose three billion dollars, ok?”"
4-5-8,"If only there were ways of testing things that wasn't just ""slap it together and press go."" What a fucking wasteful publicity stunt."
4-5-8-2,"It definitely was not just a slap together and go. Many years of R&D and extremely hard engineering work has gone into this. For a few ten of millions this is vastly cheaper than Saturn V by order of magnitudes . It excites the world (I guess minus negative Nancy’s in here) about technology and inspires so much more that will help change the world for the better.There is only so much one can test with simulations and to achieve the iterative process of development. Very rarely can every circumstance be predicated at first as one cannot test every single inch in a complex assembly, it is just unfeasible and software limited. Think of the great positive aspects this has already helped develop and showcase!"
4-5-8-2-1,"How many full-sized, fill-stacked Saturn V rockets were launched untested only to explode minutes later? >inspiresWow that inspiration sure is doing wonders to end climate change. Fuck off. It's a giant dick measuring contest by billionaires, this has nothing to do with progress. Bootlicker."
4-5-8-2-1-2,You only used 5/7 of your minimum buzzword requirement. Try fitting exploitation and greed in as well.
4-5-8-2-1-2-2,Alternative references to ending world hunger or poverty by Elon giving all his money away instead of funding rockets are popular alternatives as well.
4-5-8-2-1-2-2-2,"In this case, it is actually a benefit. Starlink is providing internet to areas that internet access was pretty much impossible. With better internet access everywhere on earth, people have access to keep up with newer innovations in farming methods and probably have better weather prediction systems to help maintain their crops more effectively. I'm not saying that it's all great and glorious or anything, but getting better worldwide connection is a big boon in equalizing people."
4-5-8-2-1-2-3,"So to be clear, you are a fan of those things and it's wrong to criticize and demand an end of them?"
4-5-8-2-1-2-3-1,"I am a fan of science and innovation, yes."
4-5-8-2-1-3,Billoonaires can do what they want. Using their money on space programs seems like a net good for me.
4-5-8-2-1-3-1,>can do what they wantTell me you're a fucking stupid capitalist American without using those words. What a fucking bootlicker.
4-5-8-2-1-4,">untestedThey had done lots of testing of individual parts before this point, and this was testing the whole thing together. What additional testing do you want?"
4-5-8-3,"You must be new to how SpaceX operates. NASA has to answer to Congress and the American people. They cannot afford public failures because people view it as a waste of money instead of a learning experience. So they have to excruciatingly test every single part before a full scale test. This takes more time any money. SpaceX is privately owned. They develop rocket technology at a insanely fast rate compared to government agencies because they prototype, test,  fail, correct problems, iterate design, and test again. This is how they’ve always operated. This isn’t some slapped together rocket. Hundreds of test have occurred already, but they can learn faster by performing full scale test during the development cycle."
4-5-8-3-1,"SpaceX just blew up millions of dollars of public money. Don't kid yourself, NASA subsidizes SpaceX."
4-5-8-4,“Slap it together and press go”. Says a person who knows absolutely nothing about rockets or anything for that matter.
4-5-8-4-1,"""How hard can it be?  It's not like it's rocket science.  Oh wait..."""
4-5-8-4-1-1,"The science is fairly simple, what goes up comes back down. The engineering to do so without killing people, not so much."
4-5-8-8,"They did all those tests. Cryos, wet dress rehearsals, static fires, suborbital hops. Some things can't be learned without just launching. Don't knock it when you clearly have no familiarity with the program."
4-5-8-8-1,What I'm familiar with is that it's a waste of resources when our planet is burning and flooding at the same time.
4-5-8-8-1-1,"Space travel is essential to developing knowledge of the climate and solutions. Historically it has been a huge return on investment- NASA alone has developed thousands of technologies which are incredibly widespread. The current era of space development, where we're focusing on living and working in space, means that a lot of that tech development is towards sustainability- if you work to help people survive in space, you'll develop techniques that make life on earth more sustainable.There have been so many useful new climate satellites in the past few years. Allowing us to launch more and do so much more cheaply is a perfectly valid use of money."
4-6,"They called it an unscheduled, rapid disassembly. Pretty on-the-nose term."
4-6-2,Rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD) is the common aerospace term for unplanned rocket explosion. 
4-6-2-1,"Only because of Elon. It's from Kerbal Space Program forums (as Rapid Unplanned Disassembly), Elon was a confirmed fan, and he then used it in a tweet."
4-7,Task failed successfully!
4-7-3,Look more like a task failed full stop to me
4-7-5,"Task was to get info, they got crucial information on things they got wrong and they won't happen again increasing the ships likleyhood of success drastically."
4-8,"Shortly after launch is not a good description, it made it all the way to separation stage and even execute the mid-air turn to initiated the separation.  I’m pretty sure this was considered a successful test and the telemetry data they received will make the next test much more likely to succeed fully.  Flight time was ~2 mins.  “Shortly after launch” would be like 5-10 seconds after."
4-8-1,Yeah I was expecting it to be like 300 feet off the ground before it exploded based on the description...
4-8-1-1,"To be fair, the speed it got off the launch pad had me biting my finger nails with worry. I didn't think it was ever going to move."
4-8-1-1-1,"Based on the commentary, the thrust to move it at all was (pun intended) astronomical..."
4-8-1-1-1-1,Twice the thrust of a Saturn V. I can’t wait to see what the telemetry says. I saw parts falling off all over the place at the 3-7sec mark. That thing was pulling all sorts of crazy Gs and the harmonic vibrations were scary… it even showed up in how the ground was moving under EverydayAstronaut’s cameras. Just wow!
4-8-1-1-1-1-1,First launch I watched live in a very long time. Was very happy with the results and eventual fireworks.
5,"Rocket reusability has lead to a major and ""often overlooked"" SpaceX benefit: “It's an incredible advantage in reliability to get your hardware back and learn stuff you didn't expect ... companies that don't recover their rockets have issues they don't know about, that someday will bite them.”"
5-1,"Kinda reminds me about the survivor-bias lessons learned in WWII.  Instead of armoring the parts of planes that come back with bullet holes, you armor the other parts—because the planes getting hit there didn’t come back."
5-1-1,I believe there was a similar study in one of the World Wars looking at head injuries in hospitals and most of them were soldiers who were wearing helmets. They almost thought helmets were the problem until they realised those without helmets weren't making it to the hospital
5-1-1-1,"Same with seatbelts, they caused increase in injuries, because before that they just died"
5-1-1-1-1,Seatbelts are way safer but people still die in cars often. If extraordinary safe self driving cars ever get here there will be a lot less organs available for donation.
5-1-1-1-1-2,Nah man. Motorcyclists would be still a thing
5-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Maybe not, there is a theory out there that says the only way self-driving cars are going to become the norm is to make driving socially unacceptable, similar to smoking cigarettes in public. At some point they can just pass laws because after all driving is a privilege not a right."
5-1-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Nah its fine. You RIDE a motorcycle ;-)And on serious note, we are really far away from what you are saying now."
5-1-2,"The field of study that spawned from those observations is vulnerability analysis, if you'd like to learn more."
5-1-2-1,"Intelligence too. There’s data to be had in the lack of data.For example, if you know someone is trying to hide something from you, one way to figure it out is to look at all the places they’re ignoring."
5-1-2-1-1,Can you explain your example a little more please?
5-1-2-1-1-2,I have no idea if this is correct or not but my assumption would be what is different about X that Y and Z don't quite meet. Like is there something unique or special about something that others around it don't do or do differently.
5-1-2-3,"I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to come up with a proper Starship Troopers reference. ""The only good vulnerability analysis is a dead vulnerability analysis.""That's all I got. Shame."
5-1-3,"Same reason why music from back then is better than music now, we only hear the good songs from that time and all the songs from now. Same with art, buildings, etc. Etc."
5-1-3-2,"The Beatles have a top-40 of famous songs, which rightfully show tht they are incredibly talented. That being said, if you check out the song lists on the albums, there are still some clunkers that ever get Radio time..."
5-1-3-2-1,"Had a coworker who would subject anyone around him to super deep cuts of Jethro Tull.   Which firmly reinforced the notion that there's a reason we only hear the stuff they play on the radio, there are some ugly damn babies in their catalog..."
5-1-3-2-1-1,"That was definitely my point. I think some of the vintage Ferraris were good looking, but...there were a few mutants that they are now embarrassed by their existance."
5-1-3-2-1-1-1,"Yeah, but I'd rather that they poop out a mutant every once in a while in an effort to make something beautiful.  Bad art is generally better than no art, and the lessons learned about what didn't work can drive better art in the future."
5-1-3-2-1-1-3,Most Ferraris aren’t actually that good looking or unique designs. But expensive red sports car = good seems to be the thinking.
5-1-3-2-1-3,"There are some bangers in the Jethro Tull deep cuts, but there are a lot that are mediocre at best too."
5-1-3-2-1-4,"Jethro Tull fans man; what a cult.I have heard some of thier less than popular stuff as well, and it's BAD.Kind of like sublime.Turns out taking lot of drugs and jamming doesn't consistently produce good music."
5-1-3-2-2,And here I am not liking any of the beetles music. Amazing how generational tastes change too
5-1-3-2-2-1,I don’t think that’s generational as there are a lot of young people who still like the Beatles. It might just not be your thing though.
5-1-3-2-2-2,"Yeah people used to love pace-changes in songs, those have gotten pretty rare. Pop Music nowadays favours beats and rythms over complex instrumentals. Not that that's bad or good - subjective opinions just change a lot"
5-1-3-2-2-2-1,I've gone from listening to mostly hard rock with like actual lyrics and stories in the song to listening to house music which is the same shit over and over again. Background music vs actually listening
5-1-3-2-3,Why don’t we do it in the road?!-John Lennon
5-1-3-2-3-1,"I see you that, and raise you a Revolution no 9."
5-1-3-2-3-1-1,I know you can say it’s art but I don’t even consider no 9 to be music. I listened all the way through once and that was it
5-1-3-2-3-1-1-1,"Oh it's garbage. Just like Why Don't We Do It.And yet, on that same album, my very favorite Beatles song: Mother Nature's Son. There's brilliance and total doodoo on the same album."
5-1-3-2-4,"Beatles? Clunkers? Doesn't exist, imho. You had 3 incredibly gifted songwriters which ensured only the best songs got on the albums because the others would veto the bad ones. Even the ""bad"" Beatles songs are gold."
5-1-3-2-4-1,I'm a huge Beatles fan who disagrees with you.
5-1-3-2-4-2,"Do you really find the yeah yeah songs great? Like ""She loves you"" and ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da""?"
5-1-3-4,I bring this up every time some mentions that houses were built better back in the day (in some ways they were). All the shite houses from back in the day are gone.
5-1-3-4-2,"They also used older wood from older trees, it's a lot stronger than new trees."
5-1-3-8,"Buildings? I mean we remember the best busic and so on but buildings doesn't like erode because we don't *like* them.Art-deco, Hausmann style, ... buildings are beautiful, not because people didn't demolish them (ask why ""architect"" is a swearword in Belgium)."
5-1-3-8-1,Poorly built buildings do indeed fall apart if not taken care of.  The most beautiful and iconic buildings are those that are more likely to have maintenance kept up as well.
5-1-6,"I see you learned that fact from that reddit post last week, "
5-1-6-1,yeah somehow I see this once a month it seems
5-1-6-1-2,Just once a month? I see it weekly at this point.
5-1-6-1-5,My first time.  What's the subreddit about being one of 1000 or something?
5-1-7,Dont how to would apply here.
5-1-8,I recall Britain or America recalling their best fighters in WW2 to train new pilots. Germany kept their best on front line and lost that institutional knowledge whenever they were killed
5-2,"I tend to subscribe to the notion that this is why Russian rocket engines were been so superior to everyone else's through the 90s (or even more recently). Their first stage boosters would come down on land, and while obviously they weren't reusable, they were intact enough to analyze how the flight had impacted the engines. From there improvements could be rolled into future designs. Meanwhile everyone else's boosters (with the exception of China) were dropped in the ocean."
5-2-1,The SRB’s of the Space Shuttle were reusable
5-2-1-1,"You're right. I was considering liquid engines only (where Russian engines held a significant advantage), but I didn't explicitly say that. The SRBs are an example of US engine recovery leading to improvements. The shuttle's main engines also were recovered but christ they were a nightmare of complexity. In spite of that they did push out a 4.5% improvement on those engines, but that's peanuts compared to generational improvements other engines saw."
5-2-1-2,Refurbishable* not reusable. They got completely stripped down and were recycled to make new ones more than they can be considered repaired for reuse.  However this is why Thiokol’s engineers knew there was a problem with the Orings in the SRB’s during cold weather and did not want the Challenger to launch. During tear down they found evidence of exhaust blowing past the Orings and found it was correlated with colder temps.
5-2-1-2-1,"Yeah, the Challenger disaster was avoidable in large part because we were recovering the boosters. We could have avoided it, and we knew that O-ring failure in cold weather was a problem beforehand, but we didn't."
5-2-1-2-1-1,"You also where aware of thermal protection tiles coming off the space shuttle, I guess no one high enough in the chain thought that could become a massive problem"
5-2-2,China's were dropped on nearby cities to save the cost of transporting the cleanup crews to the landing site
5-2-2-1,"Thankfully, there were no deaths because the areas were fully evacuated (except for all the people from the videos)."
5-2-2-1-1,After the brief period where the rocket was actually crashing and people had stopped dying casualties were minimal
5-2-3,As much as I love SpaceX for contributing so much to space exploration.........Elon is increasing becoming a social media nutbag. lol I think he should quit Twitter and just do his real jobs.
5-2-3-1,"That’s the majority of us SpaceX fan’s opinions on the topic. Unfortunately, people seem to latch onto the idea that anything supportive of his companies is a direct result of sexual intercourse with that despicable man. It’s extreme childish and irritating."
5-2-3-1-1,"I've been on r/spacex and r/SpaceXLounge for some years. Maybe they're atypical, but I don't know that many of them are actually SpaceX fans, but rather access to space fans who like SpaceX insofar as it provides cheaper and better access to space.When Blue Origin was announcing their original New Glenn plans, people were cheering them on. There was debate about whether Crew Dragon or Boring Starliner would capture the flag. There was genuine commiseration when some rocket or some rocket company failed.The scorn that the first two get is, so far as I've seen, just because they've promised so much and delivered nothing for years.If Starship were to be a fundamental failure, God between us and evil!, I think you'd see the ""fans"" flock away."
5-2-3-1-1-1,"That’s pretty much what happens. I, like many others, like Blue, Boeing, ULA, Rocket-lab, Roscosmos, and the CNSA among others. Some of their products are subpar, or heavily delayed, but unless they are causing harm to the industry (like the second HLS lawsuit), I still want them to succeed.Even in the SpaceX shitposting subreddit, where you would expect fanaticism, you’ll find people seriously discussing the shortfalls and benefits of various launch systems. Generally, I find r/spacexmasterrace (despite the name) a quite peaceful, nerdy, and mainly discussion and joke driven place where anyone can discuss the problems with Musk, NASA, the ISS, or anything else related to Spaceflight itself. Obviously, the communities surrounding SpaceX are inflated due to Starship and its (hopefully) imminent test flight, but much of the discussion revolves around other exciting things in the world of Spaceflight; a world I and many others wish to see expand."
5-2-3-2,I want less twitter Elon and more everyday astronaut interview Elon
5-2-3-2-1,Less Twitter would probably be healthy for anyone.
5-2-3-3,"Ok, but no one was taking about Elon so why bring him up?"
5-2-3-5,I separate SpaceX and Elon. It’s not fair to the brilliant minds at SpaceX doing amazing things to categorize his idiotic banter as SpaceX banter. SpaceX will succeed and flourish regardless of how dumb he is.
5-2-3-6,"If musk had a stroke or fell out a window today both Tesla and SpaceX could and would run just fine without him. They would thrive.I care not about twitter or what would happen to it, but it is good that he is distracted with his new shiny toy. SpaceX is progressing fine, maybe even better without the pale ghoul micromanaging operations."
5-2-3-6-1,"But his micromanagement build the companies, they may not have survived if not for his ""boldness"" and ego."
5-2-3-6-1-1,"Startup CEOs and established company CEOs are very, very different people. If you took a startup CEO and put them in charge of something like Coca-Cola, the CEO would fail. Meanwhile, if you took an established company CEO and put them in charge of a startup, he would fail. Musk is a startup CEO."
5-2-3-6-1-1-1,What are the nuances involved? Why cant startup Elon properly run successful companies?
5-2-3-6-1-1-1-1,"Startup CEOs are ideally ""visionary"" types that take large calculated risks to maximize the chance of maximum success, at the expense of many of the middle paths that result in moderate success. CEOs of established companies have to manage a company that already succeeded, which typically means a much lower threshold for what constitutes ""unacceptable risk"".Usually people who are well suited to one of these roles are extremely poorly suited to the other."
5-3,you know what project recovered rockets?the space shuttleplease don't ask which part led to the challenger disaster
5-3-1,the part where management refused to listen to their engineers
5-3-1-1,"And that part of refusing to listen to the engineers started well before they finalized the shuttle design. The Challenger disaster was only possible because NASA administrator James C Fletcher personally overrode the engineers' selection of a locally produced, non-segmented SRB design. No segments means no O-rings. But John had political friends in Utah, so that's where the contract went."
5-3-1-1-5,"That’s not true. Fletcher became Administrator (for the second time) in May of 1986, and the Challenger launched in January. Where did you get your information?"
5-3-1-1-5-1,"I suggest reading again. Do you think design decisions were being made in 1986? Nope.In Fletcher's first round as Administrator he made the decision to override the engineers on the SRB selection, insisting on a segmented SRB when the engineers wanted a one-piece shell for the SRB.O-ring burnthrough can't happen if you just have solid steel and no O-rings.And yes, Fletcher was brought back to spin doctor the disaster he enabled.Edit: Found an article for you to peruse: "
5-3-1-1-5-1-1,And it was total coincidence that the segmented SRBs would be made by Morton Thiokol in his home state of Utah.
5-3-1-2,"They had a reusable rocket that they treated as if it were disposable, and look! We disposed it!"
5-3-1-2-1,"> reusable rocket that they treated as if it were disposable,SLS is using the SSMEs and treating them as disposable."
5-3-1-6,"If this could happen at NASA of all places, I hate to imagine what could happen at SpaceX, a company motivated by profit."
5-3-1-6-1,An organization motivated by profit is more results-driven than an organization motivated by politics.
5-3-1-6-1-1,Yeah look how that's going for Norfolk Southern?
5-3-1-6-1-1-1,It is working great for SpaceX with the most reliable orbital launch vehicle of all time and the lowest cost per kg.
5-3-1-6-1-1-2,Well they did get their record profits…
5-3-2,The part that led to the loss of Challenger and Columbia was NASA Management ignoring known issues.
5-3-2-1,"Or maybe the part that led to the losses of Challenger and Columbia was pressure to launch resulting in poor judgement of risk. Any organization will have that, especially with $100M’s at stake and limited time windows for every launch. The biggest plus for SpaceX here is with the reusable nature and the regular schedule of launches, any single launch is less of a big deal."
5-3-2-1-1,">The biggest plus for SpaceX here is with the reusable nature and the regular schedule of launches, any single launch is less of a big deal.More complacency, more chances for missing something in a safety check..."
5-3-2-1-1-1,Complacent is a word that can never be used on SpaceX. Their booster landing safety record is currently longer than the longest running successful rocket ever built; it is literally safer to land a SpaceX booster than to *launch* any other rocket. They have their safety down to a science.
5-3-2-2,"yeah but this fluff piece gives me some of that energy coming out of the feynmann interviews with people at nasa claiming failure chances of 1 in 100,000 launches"
5-3-2-2-1,"> nasa claiming failure chances of 1 in 100,000 launchesWhen launched within intended parameters sure. If you ignore the intended parameters, then all bets are off."
5-3-2-2-1-1,"The point is that those failure odds were pure management driven marketing guff, with no basis in reality.  Engineers involved in the hardware privately assessed the reliability of the system at around 1 in 100 to 1 in 200, and a modern review of the early Shuttle flights put LOCV at about 1 in 72."
5-3-3,"What you're suggesting here is incorrect.The engineering team at Morton Thiokol had already determined in 1985 that the O-rings were problematic at low temperatures. That was a result of analysis of the SRBs from launches that had occurred at lowish temperatures up to that point. To the point that they'd initiated a redesign in July of that year. (6 months prior to the loss)The day before the launch, MT engineers initially expressed concerns about the temperatures and pushed for a delay until the weather warmed up. They retracted that concern only after an internal closed door meeting. A meeting where their own senior leadership likely pressured them into the retraction.From a technical standpoint, recovery allowed them to detect the issue, start fixes and issue warnings.It was 100% a leadership failure. A failure of caring more about appearences than about technical realities or a safety culture."
5-3-3-4,Do you think Elon doesn't care more about appearance than about technical realities or safety? That sounds like a problem that is inevitably going to repeat itself when a businessman is presented with a profit motive.
5-3-3-4-3,I think it's not talked about enough that the SpaceX bugs are getting worked out on launches with no people on them.
5-3-3-4-6,"Wtf are you talking about? SpaceX has been kicking ass for 10+ years. Go away, space clearly doesn't interest you."
5-3-3-4-6-1,NASA was kicking ass for decades before the challenger explosion
5-3-3-4-6-1-1,"SpaceX has launched more in the past 3 years than the Shuttle did in 30.  100% successful, at that."
5-3-3-4-6-1-2,The Shuttle was a boondoggle long before Challenger exploded.
5-3-4,There was no real SS evolution on the orbiter. That was its biggest problem.
5-3-4-1,"Biggest NASA mistake. They built this incredible groundbreaking technological marvel, but then never iterated on that success."
5-3-4-1-1,"The design and use case of the Shuttle made it really dangerous to iterate. SpaceX can rapidly iterate their rockets because they are each relativity inexpensive and did not fly human on board.IIRC the Shuttle did have the capability to fly autonomously, however many of the capabilities and purposes of the Shuttle required humans. The cost per launch prohibited flying uncrewed test launches.As cool as the Shuttle was, it was completely unsustainable and inherently unsafe."
5-3-4-1-1-1,Wasn't it the Buran that could fly autonomously ?
5-3-4-1-2,"They tried, the government cut funding to privative space flight with companies like SpaceX leading the lobbying charge."
5-3-4-1-2-2,Commercial cargo began life 30 years into the existence of shuttle and cost a pittance. Why do you think it prevented the shuttle from being iterated upon?
5-3-4-1-2-3,SpaceX almost never existed. They were not lobbying the government during the Falcon 1 era.
5-3-4-1-2-5,"Yeah definitely. It's a congressional mishandling of NASA, not a mistake from within NASA.SLS could have been dope if it weren't such a  porkbarrel.  I guess congress iterates too, except they iterate towards more effectively channeling money into their pockets."
5-4,"It's worth contrasting this to the shuttle program where they did recover hardware, frequently identified problems, and then did absolutely fuck all to mitigate or prevent them, which as we know, was fine and never went wrong at all."
5-4-1,What are you talking about? They used that information to mitigate problems all the time. They were actively working on the o-ring problem and foam shedding problems before both lead to disaster. And there are tons of problems that you've never heard about because they were just fixed.
5-4-1-1,"Once again we see the classic Y2K phenomenon. When people bust nuts to head off and prevent problems, the problems never happen. Then people conclude there never was a problem to start with."
5-4-1-1-2,plus this sub has a massive hate boner for nasa
5-5,That's how NASA knew about o-ring failure issues prior to Challenger disaster. They just chose to do nothing.
5-5-1,"And unlike NASA, SpaceX is a private entity. They don’t have the same incentives pushing them toward safety."
5-6,"This isn't the first time a company has been able to look over flown hardware. The difference here is that SpaceX isn't afraid to make changes to their hardware. When they identify something they don't like, they change it right away.*Cough, Cough* Shuttle *Cough*"
5-6-1,God damn do people talk out of their ass
5-6-1-1,NASA stopped iterating in 92 when they stopped building new shuttles. The fleet just got older and older until it was killed. And for what? SLS is a huge waste. NASA went backwards.
5-6-1-1-1,NASA went from having the budget to get anything in their minds done like the military to being treated like the schools
5-6-1-1-1-1,"20 billion a year is more than enough, they blew it. Congress turned NASA into a jobs program. At this point it’s too corrupt to save. SLS is the living dead."
5-6-1-1-1-1-1,I’m not even reading past the 20 billion a year It isn’t enough and we both know it If the military needs 600 billion for earth matters NASA needs a bit more then 20 billion for the future of humanity and our ability to leave this rock
5-6-1-1-1-1-1-1,"SpaceX has achieved a lot more with a lot less.Untold billions have been and continue to be wasted on SLS a full 8 years after reusability was proven. NASA can’t even use the money they have wisely, it’d be stupid to give them more."
5-8,"People thought Elon was crazy in the beginning when so many of the first SpaceX missions failed spectacularly and he'd yell something like ""Great! We got all the data!"" He proved that blowing shit up over and over again followed by an extensive analysis is an excellant way to find and fix even the smallest of design flaws, and tabulate what sort of readouts indicate an impending problem."
5-8-1,Fail fast. Fail forward.It works.
5-8-3,"I mean if he's anything he's a great ""business"" guy. Bring able to market your failures as victories is a great way to keep investors involved"
5-8-3-1,Learning from your failures and improving on them is what engineering and science is all about.
5-8-3-1-1,He's neither of those things though
5-8-3-1-1-1,He's an engineer and has a physics degree.
5-8-3-1-1-1-1,"No he's not and no he probably doesn't actually have a physics degree.  The details about his degree are pretty sus, but yes on paper he has one.Also looking at your history it's just filled with you simping for Elon musk. So clearly I'm not changing your mind in him"
6,SpaceX giant rocket explodes minutes after launch from Texas
6-1,Space is hard.
6-1-1,"""Space is hard."" If you haven't selected a motto yet, may I suggest that as the new Space Force motto."
6-1-8,It is. Space X said that if they don't explode the launch pad then it's a win so I guess this was really good progress.
6-2,"(Edit after second watch) looks like stage separation issue and controller destruction when it starts tumbling. That hopefully gives some data, often the forces on that system are different that simulates from vibrations etc. The first minutes were cool seeing clearing so slowly - 30sec for first KM of altitude!"
6-2-1,"looks like there were issues right away, control was lost well before stage separation would have taken place."
6-2-1-1,"I think they hit, “let’s go,” and immediately said, “uh ohh!”It’s easier to say, “that went exactly as planned,” when you never release the plan ahead of time."
6-2-1-2,How do you see this? Really curious why they let it run if that’s the case. Aren’t they supposed to destruct if “not in control”?
6-2-1-2-1,"From the official livestream, and then additional footage, you could see that multiple engines were out early on (but within design margins), it looked like a major malfunction happened right before stage separation which sent the rocket into the uncontrolled spin."
6-2-2,"Does anyone else get Uncanny Valley when reading comments these days?! Now I can't tell if a comment is an AI bot response, or just a Redditor who is a little cattywompus."
6-2-2-1,"We will be flooded with so much bot content, human communication will cease. It's infinitely easier to produce misinformation than discover actual facts, I worry real truth will be outnumbered into irrelevancy and we will live in a world exposed to nothing but bots and fake content. Im' already seeing so many AI posts on FB of ""amazing photo"" of a bee or birds, which I know to be fake as a biologist, but the posts get thousands of positive comments 99% of which believe it is real. I worry."
6-2-2-1-1,"Has already happened. The only real thing that has a measurable impact on disinformation is education. Ai will continue to stress our system exactly as you say without more education and people making informed opinions. We’re at a crossroads right now and the outlook isn’t too good, but not completely fatal yet."
6-2-2-1-1-1,"Not necessarily fatal. But just by pure math of how much time it takes to produce OC drastically favors AI. Writing an article can take days, getting an amazing photo can take months, publishing a scientific paper can take years; but just seconds for AI. Even if we were educated to identify AI content with 99% accuracy, it wouldn't be enough if AI content was thousands of times more numerous; and it's hard to see why that wouldn't end up happening given the basic math."
6-2-2-2,Nothing is true and everything is possible
6-3,"After a career in IT working on very large systems, many of them utterly fall over when run “at scale”.  This is not surprising and was necessary."
6-3-1,This is why it never ceases to amaze me that we put a person on the moon in the 60’s
6-3-1-1,With less computing power than what we have in our pockets today.
6-3-1-1-1,Incredible. You had scientists and engineers doing calculations and designs using papers and pencils
6-3-1-1-1-1,Spokesman for SpaceX “ we experienced an unexpected rapid disassembly event”  at least they can have a sense of humor
6-3-1-1-1-1-2,Is that fancy speak for it blew the fuck up?
6-3-1-1-1-1-5,Engineering version of tactical backwards repositioning
6-3-1-1-2,"No that statistic is so out of date that is basically pointless, the difference in computing power between a modern smartphone and the Apollo computer is so vast, comparing them is essentially meaningless.Really what is a much better comparison is that there are cell phone *chargers* now with more computing power than Apollo Guidance Computer."
6-3-1-1-2-1,I'd like to see a USB charger land on the moon.  The ultimate flex.
6-3-1-1-2-1-1,And then have it run DOOM on the MOON
6-3-1-1-2-1-1-3,Happy cake day!
6-3-1-1-3,Less computing power than in your key fob
6-3-1-4,yeah because that rocket was like 100x times simpler and tested hundreds more times than starship was.
6-3-1-4-1,Who’s talking about starship? Not everything is about spaceX moron
6-3-1-8,No we didn't.
6-3-1-8-1,Shut the fuck up
6-3-1-8-1-1,Nah
6-3-2,Necessary? You’re making it sound like an exploding rocket is a good thing for Space X….
6-3-2-1,"That's how SpaceX operates. Iterate and don't be afraid to blow stuff up. You only get so much information from simulation. Simulation can't account for all of the variables of reality, e.g. material impurities and assembly imperfections. A launch test also highlights integration issues between discrete systems within the entire vehicle under stress. You get a lot more useful data that you can quickly iterate on when you gather telemetry from a live system.The stated goal of the mission was to get the rocket off the pad without destroying it. Everything past that was just data collection for the next attempt. Sure, the hope is that everything goes off without a hitch, but that was known to be unlikely on the first attempt."
6-3-2-1-1,"The stated goal of the mission was actually more specific— For its debut launch, SpaceX's Starship will lift off from its Starbase pad, but not attempt to land. Instead, the Super Heavy booster will separate about 3 minutes into flight and aim to make a soft landing and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship vehicle, meanwhile, is expected to reach a near orbital velocity that will carry it around the world toward a targeted splashdown point in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. The entire Starship test flight should last about 90 minutes, SpaceX has said."
6-3-2-1-1-1,"Yes, but you are conflating possible with probable. They program in a full mission that the system may possibly complete because full launches like this are expensive. If everything just happens to work, you don't want to cut it short because you made it further than you thought you would. SpaceX openly said they just wanted to get the rocket off the pad without destroying it. It is the first time they have actually flown the booster so there were a lot of unknowns. Stage separation and reaching orbit was secondary."
6-3-2-1-1-1-2,They openly publicized it as an orbital test flight with re-entry.
6-3-2-1-1-1-2-1,"Nobody expected it to survive. SpaceX needs a full flight profile as an aspirational goal, as well as for the FAA, etc. Can't just YOLO and get to space them ask what's next.This was 100% expected, and Ship 24 Booster 7 are already hella outdated by a few models - they needed to get rid of it and what better way than to launch and see how it holds.Look up SN8's flight test. Hell, see for yourself that they do it this way.You learn from the failures far more than success, and this gives them a wealth of data to iterate. Newer models of starships already standing by and assembled have many fixes already, this will just show them to any hidden issues, which is what you wantSpaceX has a mentality of if it ain't broke, break it - the other alternative is SLS, see how that went.This is why the SpaceX workers cheered during explosion - it's to be celebrated and the test went incredibly well"
6-3-2-4,I’d be willing to bet it’s a fan boy or paid bot trying to sound smart
6-3-2-4-1,"I’d be willing to bet you watch crash test videos and say, “lol, that cars front end crumpled. Dumb car.”"
6-3-2-4-1-3,Starship’s mission was to orbit the Earth and land.It blew up in less than 5 minutes. This wasn’t a crash test.
6-3-2-4-1-3-2,"This was a test. Starship's FAA mandated flight plan was to orbit the Earth and land, but SpaceX publicly acknowledged about a 50% chance of success."
6-3-2-4-1-3-2-1,"It was a test that was supposed be an orbital flight. Not sure why some people can’t acknowledge it didn’t accomplish that. It’s like a kid saying they’d get an F on a test that they were expected to pass… and then failing and saying “look, I told you I was going to fail. Aren’t you proud?”  It failed. End of story."
6-3-2-5,It was a test launch. The article is to grab the attention of people who don’t realize it was considered a success as soon as it left the launchpad.
6-3-2-5-1,"It was supposed to orbit the earth… but exploding beforehand is the same thing, I guess."
6-3-6,"Well, in this case SpaceX hadn’t yet completed a static fire with all 33 engines. No wonder all the engines didn’t suddenly work when launched either. It’s like pushing to prod when tests are still failing."
6-3-6-1,They did a 31 engine static fire. Six engines went out today.
6-3-6-1-1,31 is not the full complement of 33
6-3-6-1-1-1,Fair enough
6-4,"Understand that when it blew up, the people that built it cheered loudly. Because everything after this thing lighting engines and clearing the pad was a bonus. They now have test data. This was one of many possible “successful” outcomes."
6-4-2,How it is successful? They wanted a trip around the globe. It landed in the Gulf of Mexico. It was launched from Texas.
6-4-2-1,It left the pad. Success is a spectrum.
6-4-2-1-2,But it’s own goal was to circle then entire earth and it didn’t?
6-4-2-1-2-1,"No, it’s main goal was to clear the pad"
6-4-2-1-2-1-1,It clearly states in this article that the goal was to circle the planet.
6-4-2-1-2-1-1-1,"As an above comment explained, systems this massive and complex are expected to fail “at scale” the first several times, especially considering it’s the most powerful rocket ever built and doesn’t yet have any test data to drive further calibration. The ultimate goal is to circle the planet, but the main goal for this initial run was to successfully light and lift off. It’s an incremental process."
6-4-2-2,"They *wanted* a trip around the globe. The *main goal* was to learn, which is what testing is for. That goal was achieved. That is the success."
6-4-2-2-1,"Marketing is one hell of a thing, ain’t it? Lol"
6-4-2-2-1-1,Not understanding how an iterative testing process works is a hell of a thing ain’t it?
6-4-2-2-1-1-1,Just keep lowering the bar and you’ll eventually be able to call having a rocket at all a success.Don’t confuse learning experience with “success”. A success is what happens when you reach your final goal.
6-4-2-3,"Because the goal was to test the rocket, and while it didn’t fully complete the test, it did give data and provides a benchmark for them to iterate towards. They’ve built enough rockets to know that some of them are going to blow up"
6-4-2-3-1,"The goal was to clear the pad, anything above the pad was a bonus. Given rockets in early stages of testing tend to rapidly disassemble themselves on the pad during launch, clearing the tower on the first launch was impressive. It also suffered multiple booster failures and was still gaining altitude prior to the separation failure. And it entered into a flat spin, putting the craft under high stress, and the spacecraft remained intact until they triggered the self destruct."
6-4-2-3-2,“And while it didn’t fully complete the test” So it was not a success. It was a learning experience.
6-4-2-3-2-3,"WowYour comments are crazy. They can’t test something without a plan. They can’t stop half way. If their is a 0.00001% chance for success they have to plan for it.It was a test to gain data, they have a line up of different rockets behind this one to test.Anything past getting past the tower was a success. Only a very big fool would have thought that the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket would meet all objectives on the first try. But everyone would wish it would happen, just like we wish we have the Winning lotto ticket, could happen, but I would be a fool to think I was winning.They achieved much more than their reasonable thoughts of where they would get.The worlds biggest and most powerful rocket made it over 30km in the air to stage separation before the flight termination system blew it up. So technically the booster  sounds to work on its first flight."
6-4-2-3-2-3-1,"The 2nd paragraph in this article states the goal is to circle the earth. It didn’t. People calling it a “success” have low standards, I guess."
6-4-2-3-2-3-1-1,"The goal was to test the rocket and collect dataThe aspiration of spaceX was to clear the launch towerThe testing plan was to follow the flight path. The flight path had to be made in case there was not failure.It’s like if I buy a lotto ticket, I hope to win, but I’m a fool to spend the money before I win, but if I win I know how I will spend it. But ultimately I know I will not win.This is why people are objecting to how it is reported. You don’t see articles of Rob the lotto ticket buyer who on Monday didn’t win and now he’s a failure.For spacex the test was very successful, so many things passed,so much data."
6-4-3,Yeah I would be cheering too if my boss was showing signs of burnout and instability lol that enthusiasm is partly if not entirely due to the desire to keep their paycheck lol
6-5,The first test launch of the most powerful rocket everThe test was successful once it lit and cleared the pad. Everything that followed is data for the next one
6-5-1,Word for word what the SpaceX PR guy said on camera.
6-5-1-1,"Word for word what every space fan thinks.The alternative is spending 10's of billions and more than a decade to test and simulate every possibility and hope that one test goes according to plan because if it doesn't that's the end of the program. This is what NASA did with SLS. More than a decade and $60 billion for a rocket where a lot of parts were literally taken from storage (leftovers from the shuttle, Engines and boosters). SX spent maybe a tenth of that and maybe 3 years seriously making this revolutionary rocket in what looks like a rebel base on Tatooine.Fail fast and fail often is not a bug but a feature."
6-5-1-1-1,>Fail fast and fail often is not a bug but a feature.People that never design/build things don't understand this.
6-5-1-1-1-1,Fail. It stands for “First attempt in learning”
6-5-1-1-1-1-1,And spelling
6-5-1-1-1-1-1-1,Faal fast and faal often
6-5-1-1-2,Counter off spend time and effort on fixing climate problems and stop dicking around pumping the atmosphere full of even more carbon so some rich fucks feel cool.Massive waste of resources currently.
6-5-1-1-2-1,"There’s a hilarious irony in someone using a phone with GPS to complain about space travel.I’m not sure why some people pretend satellites have no positive impact on the world or the environment with advanced weather force casting capable of preventing natural disasters, crop monitoring to maximise yields, monitoring air quality, the water cycle, forests, etc. It’s honestly hilarious that you probably only care about climate change because a rocket has deployed a satellite that has allowed us as a species to better understand and study climate change. Especially since carbon capture technology research is being funded by SpaceX for use on earth to counteract global warming with the bonus of being useful on Mars."
6-5-2,Wouldn’t it be nice if every news agency would post truthful articles? It’s so disingenuous to say that it just “blew up” when most people will never take the time to read past the article title.
6-5-2-4,My thoughts exactly. What a misleading title. Although technically it’s true…
6-5-2-4-1,What’s misleading It’s a giant rocket It exploded Out of Texas Minutes after launch All of that is independently true and it did not change the frame of reference by how it’s worded
6-5-2-4-1-1,"What is the takeaway from what you wrote?Would that be different than the actual mission goals?Once you consider these two things, you’ll be able to answer your own question."
6-5-2-4-1-2,"I refuse to lather SpaceX up, kiss its ring like everybody else. Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts. A rocket exploded. It happened in Texas."
6-5-2-4-1-2-1,Blinded by your tribal hate maybe? This stuff is standard for developing a rockets
6-5-2-4-1-2-1-1,Blinded by your infatuation maybe?
6-5-2-4-1-4,It implies that the explosion was a problem. This was actually a celebratory pyrotechnics display after the extremely successful launch. The media just doesn't get it.
6-5-2-4-1-4-1,"Weird considering they had to self implode because they lost attitude control when the rocket was spinning out of control; and failed to separate.It successfully got of the launch pad, it failed to complete its task."
6-5-3,>”Test flight goes better than planned”Doesnt generate enough outrage to get clicks.
6-5-4,"Man, Elmo really can do no wrong in some people’s eyes, huh?"
6-5-4-2,"Space is hard. He's not making anything, but some of the best private aerospace engineers in the world are! As a private citizen, it's so great to see a private company attempting things like this, and paying their own way."
6-5-4-3,"Not sure if you're aware but SpaceX is sitting at something like 3% failure rate. NASA's operational record is something like 15%, and they've spent 10x as much as SpaceX to develop a non-reusable, more expensive, less-capable launch system.So maybe your sentiment is better expressed as, ""Man, SpaceX really can do no right in some people's eyes."""
6-5-4-4,And he lives rent free in others whether he’s doing something wrong or not.
6-5-4-4-1,(He’s not going to notice you.)
6-5-4-4-1-1,lol touch grass.
6-5-6,Successful? It had a mission and failed spectacularly
6-5-6-1,"Wow naive much?They have a huge line up of rockets behind it all DIFFERENT and waiting to be tested.The primary mission was to collect data. The hopes were that it would clear the launch pad.The mission was extremely successfully. It was the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made making it all the way to stage Separation.Without a flight plan, what would they have done after they pressed go? They had to plan the full flight. It’s not a computer game. You don’t just turn off when you want.Also the goal was destruction, at some point the rocket was going to be destroyed and they wanted to test till it hit the first weak point.Sure in a perfect world everything would work and for sure they would like everything to work first time, but that’s not realistic. This mission was. 90%+ going to blow up during it. +4 mins is a huge success"
6-5-6-2,It was a big success. People were literally cheering when it got blown up. It clearing the launch pad is a massive step forward
6-5-6-2-2,They’re cheering because there’s fewer exploding rockets than Teslas.
6-5-6-2-2-1,Revealing comment.
6-5-7,Their data is getting very expensive. That’s why you spend money on planning or creating a model. I’m not rocket science and neither is Elmo.
6-6,This probably wasn’t entirely unexpected.
6-6-2,"Entirely expected haha, the main goal was to clear the tower enough so that any potential(likely) explosion wouldn't damage the tower or build site too much. Anything beyond that was just welcome bonus points!This flight was just the first test of all systems working together to see where it would fail. There will certainly be more like this one that will end in booms, then some day all the issues are hammered out and the tests start flying without booms."
6-7,"The goal was to simply clear the tower and they got up to 40km in altitude.   Unlike NASA, SpaceX iterates fast and tests often.  Data from this launch will help the 5 new Starships current under construction."
6-7-1,But our progress is limited to profitability. Pretty sad tbh
6-7-1-1,"Is it? Today's rocket was completely annihilated, zero profits. Still progress though, as far as most are concerned."
6-7-1-1-2,Bro shut up. Yes this company wouldn’t exist without profit. It is a for profit company
6-7-1-1-2-1,A vast majority of their funding comes from the us government/NASA
6-7-1-1-2-2,"Why shut up? This for-profit company is operating at a loss in order to advance science. Profit may be the end goal, but we're currently progressing without it."
6-7-1-1-2-2-1,"No. Shut up. Profit is the end goal. Without it, they would not be doing this. Would make much more sense for us to fund NASA more rather than subsidizing a private company whenever it’s about to fail. You can’t just be like “well since they’re operating at a loss as an investment for future profit-therefore it’s not currently for profit”. This is absurd."
6-7-3,The goal was to do a full revolution around the Earth. It blew up.
6-7-3-2,"The goal was never to do a full revolution....  the most ideal outcome was for the second stage to make it near Hawaii, but they estimated the odds at far less than 50%.  Good thing is, they have another booster and ship pretty close to ready, so depending on the repairs that will be needed for the launch tower, we could see another attempt in a couple months - which’s is remarkable historically for any rocket launches"
7,The FAA has granted SpaceX permission to launch its massive Starship rocket
7-1,Looking forward to watching but I have a feeling we’re in for a few scrubs before we get to the engines actually lighting. Gonna make next week even more of an excruciating wait
7-1-1,Calling it nowFirst attempt with a 2 hour hold then scrub before t-60mSecond attempt scrub similar A couple t+0 aborts
7-1-1-1,"A very young Leroy suffered through something like this back in 1981, making multiple trips out to an insanely crowded Cape to try and watch Columbia launch. The wait for launch day is like waiting for Christmas, the scrubs are like being told you can’t open your presents until the 26th…27th…28th…"
7-1-1-1-1,"A very young ferret went out in the bitter cold on multiple days (better part of a week) waiting for Challenger to launch in 1986.Only thing worse than having to wait a few extra days to open your presents is finally getting to open one, only for it to explode in your hands, and your parents confiscate the rest of your presents for an indeterminate time while they figure out if it’s still safe to celebrate.I hope they take as much time as they need to keep things as safe as they can."
7-1-1-1-1-1,"At least this time there's no crew. If it turns into a 20-kiloton firecracker they'll have a lot of infrastructure to replace and maybe some EPA screams about South Padre, but it won't be a challenger repeat."
7-1-1-1-1-3,"Could be worse. I watched in school. My teacher was an alternate for christa. Granted he was a ways down on the list but he had medically cleared and told he would be a front runner in future missions. He was super psyched and the class spent WEEKS learning about it. When it happened he got up, turned the tv off, and just left the class room."
7-1-1-1-2,That’s fine with me I can wait a few days or months or years. Hell I’m going to see a crewed moon landing before the winds of winter comes out.No but seriously this is aw inspiring anticipation and each scrub makes it that much more exciting because you know they will get it eventually.
7-1-1-2,"They have run a dozen complete wet dress rehearsals now without any problems. I don't think they would start having problems now. T+0 aborts seem likely though. They have never successfully turned on all of the engines at once. Arguably they don't need to in order to reach orbit, starship has a lot of margin.  But I doubt they would give a go to proceed if there are any significant problems."
7-1-1-2-1,"Good point.The goal is better data, not showmanship. There's an unparalleled amount of combined dynamic conditions happening under those engines.The truly extraordinary thing is how many engines there are compared to any previous (or current) launch system. The potential for what equates to butterfly effects is unrivaled, but if it works, oh my, new stage of humanities progress."
7-1-1-2-1-1,"Falcon Heavy has 27 engines and all its flights have been successful. Sure, the engines are smaller,  but the number is very similar."
7-1-1-2-1-1-4,"The technology is not though. Booster and Starship run on LOX and liquid methane, where falcons Merlin’s run on kerosene bases fuel."
7-1-1-6,I'd settle for this over an enormous boom.
7-1-1-7,What about: 
7-1-1-8,Is there a reason why they can't just do some pre lauch testing and then post a  lauch date?
7-1-2,"Perhaps, but they didn't have scrubs during WDR or the static fire"
7-1-2-1,Some of the engines didn't fire for the static fire. They will probably want all of them to before releasing the hold down clamps.
7-1-2-1-1,"Yeah, so in essence that 31 engine static fire was a good practice run to iron out the kinks. In theory that'll mean they're less likely to encounter those problems this time around"
7-1-2-1-1-1,"Worth noting that 31 is sufficient for orbit and a successful mission, though obviously not ideal."
7-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Given that the engines that did fail, failed very early on in the static burn (one at ignition, one seconds later IIRC), that leaves significantly less redundancy for the rest of the burn to staging…"
7-1-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Sure, but the raptor engines they've been firing out at macgregor have shown that they can fire continuously with relative consistency. That startup phase is gonna be the toughest part of flight for those engines and the riskiest."
7-1-4,Is there a Google calendar / ifttt /web page I can html scrape for getting up to date dates for launch? I'd very much like to be online for all launch attempts.Manually visiting a web page everyday is my last option.
7-1-4-2,"Great app called ""Next Spaceflight"" will send you push notifications of every rocket launch worldwide. I have mine set to receive 60 minute and 10 minute prior notifications."
7-1-4-2-1,Thos sounds cool. How many launches are there? Dont want to get bombarded with notifications.
7-1-4-2-1-1,Generally every day or two.
7-1-4-8,NYT has an astronomy and space calendar: 
7-1-6,"I am fully expecting a spaceship load of Vulcans to turn up, after launch, and welcome us into the Federation."
7-1-6-2,Have to wait a couple more decades. Though Cochrane should already be born? Pay him a visit.
7-2,SpaceX have a pending Live Stream starting in 2 days.  
7-3,"Biggest and most powerful rocket ever launched. Whatever the outcome, it'll be one hell of a spectacle.If it fails, we all hope it at least clears the pad first. And while reentry is important, I'm happy as long as it can make it to ""orbit"". Everything else can be figured out later."
7-3-2,"Is it planned to orbit? I thought it was just up, separate, then try to land"
7-3-2-1,"My understanding is that it's gonna go very, very close to orbit, but just slightly miss it intentionally. I think this is so if the ship breaks apart, the debris comes down quickly rather than potentially be stuck up there for a while and have an uncontrolled reentry.There's been many long and pedantic debates over whether this should or should not be considered orbital, arguments which I'd rather not spark again here. But yes essentially it will be doing all the same stuff it'll be doing for a real orbital flight, achieving similar speeds and experiencing similar forces, while technically not really reaching orbit."
7-3-2-3,"It's a semi-orbit. It'll have nearly enough energy, but they're deliberately not placing Starship into a stable orbit, likely in case it blows up partway through so the pieces don't stay in space.The booster will attempt a boostback/return, and water landing off the coast, while Starship will impact the Pacific, near Hawaii, I don't believe they're attempting a soft water landing there."
7-3-2-3-1,"If it blows up, it wouldn't have been orbital anyway and have an unpredictable fall path regardless of this flight plan. However if the engines failed to re ignite to initiate the re entry, now they're on a less controlled path down. Like the Chinese booster that went accidentally orbital and the place it'd fall was a crapshoot.In the future when they have the control systems confidence up, they'd actually have a lot of control over landing zone based on how they pitch during early re entry, they could stretch it out halfway or more around the earth before aero braking harder or doing s turns."
7-3-5,"I'm pretty sure the outcome of Monday will not be spectacular. Scrubs are not exciting to experience, and I expect at least 2 :("
7-3-6,I thought the Saturn V had a higher payload capacity?
7-3-6-1,"The Starship payload estimates have varied over time cuz it's still being developed and tweaked, but my understanding is that Saturn V beats a reusable Starship, but an expendable Starship leaves it in the dust. And Starship with orbital refueling crushes everything. But we don't currently have solid estimates to say for sure."
7-3-6-1-1,The oribital refuelling bit amazes me... enough delta v to land on any body in the solar system.  Insane!
7-3-6-1-1-1,Uh Jupiter?
7-3-6-1-1-1-1,Probably don't need *that* much delta v for that as long as you're fine with it taking a few decades. We've gotten voyager and the sun missions to work.
7-3-6-1-1-1-1-1,and juice right now I guess
7-3-7,I am kind of sad that they plan to bring it back. So huge ship could make a nice station in the orbit.
7-3-7-1,"These early launches will be very barebones as they continuously iterate on the design. Much more important to get data on the reentry so they can work to perfect it. Then in a few years they can focus on making proper station variants, if needed."
7-3-7-6,It's just a stainless steel tank. Less than half a centimeter thick. Not the kind of station you want to be inside lol.
7-3-8,they’re going for orbit the first launch?Not a hop where they go straight up and down?
7-3-8-1,"They already did a bunch of hops around 2 years ago. Now they've made a bunch more progress. If they're gonna get everything ready for a hop, then they may as well go all the way and get even more data."
7-3-8-2,Just a quick flight to Hawaii
7-4,Monday at 5am PST. Definitely working from home that day.
7-4-1,Debating between having to wake up that early and having a no-go vs not waking up early and missing it...
7-4-2,Is it 5AM? where did you see this?
7-4-2-1,SpaceX: [The 150-minute test window will open at 7:00 a.m. CT.]Didn't check the time zone conversion.
7-4-2-1-1,Sweet!!! That's before work for me!
7-4-2-2,"Seen a lot of speculation that the tight window, including apparently some cooperation from the FAA, was to thwart the likes if Sierra Club.  And frankly speaking, tough.  I'd like to see feet on Mars before I die, so Sierra Club can take their anti-SpaceX boner and get bent."
7-4-2-2-1,Sorry you don’t get outside enough to be grateful for everything they’ve done.
7-4-2-2-1-1,I have enough clarity not to treat it like a balancing act.
7-4-4,"5pm Australian time, perfect."
7-5,I have not been this excited for anything in I don't know how long
7-5-1,Since... James Webb telescope?These events are honestly such a cool reminder of human progress. It gives me optimism about the future of humanity and the grand scale of us as a species and not only as individuals.
7-5-1-1,"I still can’t believe James Webb worked and everything went exactly right for it to happen. The images it keeps sending back just get more and more unreal, I can’t wait to see what all it finds during its lifespan"
7-5-1-1-1,"Honestly I expected JWST deployment to be about 50/50 at best, with a very slim chance of everything going perfectly, but they really did nail it."
7-5-1-1-1-2,"At this point I may as well appreciate that it cost what it did cost. That’s what it took to work on the first try. On the other hand, with Starship available to deliver large instruments like it for cheap, the next “Webbs” will be much cheaper and simpler to make, since you may as well have 2 or 4 of them and if one fails then so what."
7-5-1-3,This launch means James Webb 2.0 will be way better.
7-5-2,This might be the most exciting event in my lifetime.
7-5-2-1,The most exciting event in your lifetime … SO FAR.  ;)So much more to look forward to.
7-5-2-1-1,I wish I had this kind of optimism in my life
7-5-2-1-1-1,"What Starship opens up and plans to do is pretty exciting.Return to the Moon and boots on Mars are the next two things I can think of on that list to be excited about.Replacing ISS, and more humans being off world at once is another two things.Sure, they all start with Starship’s launch but they are pretty exciting in their own right."
7-5-5,Last time I was this excited for a launch was Falcon Heavy.
7-6,No we don’t want no scrub. A scrub is a launch that cannot go through today. Elon hoping for a fully stacked ride with a ceramics side just trying to orbit in space.
7-6-1,Don't go chasing orbit falls...
7-6-1-1,Stick to the gravity wells that you’re used to.
7-8,"Been waiting for this moment for *checks date* more than 4 years! Starhopper's first engine firing was April 4th, 2019!"
7-8-1,That is actually incredibly fast.
8,SpaceX simultaneous landing of Falcon Heavy boosters from today’s Space Force launch
8-1,This is incredible. It blows me away every time this happens
8-1-1,"No joke. Every single time I watch a landing I think, 'that's exactly how a spaceship in a movie would land'. Is this real life?"
8-1-1-1,It still looks like CGI to me. My head can't get over how insane this is
8-1-1-1-1,When it was bursting through the cloud it looked like 90's CGI... Holy shit 90's CGI wasn't that bad?
8-1-1-1-1-1,"Add lens flares, weird angles, woobly camera, and that's basically 2020's spaceship CGI."
8-1-1-1-1-1-1,That angle from the ground when the Starship prototypes flip over looks so surreal. Really CGI like. Showed a co-worker who’s been so busy with kids the flip of SN10 landing yesterday and I made a point to say that it wasn’t CGI and his jaw dropped. He said it never entered his mind that the angle and footage was real. I’m talking about the angle at the 1:16 mark here:
8-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"I completely relate to the feeling, SpaceX's Spaceship looks like cheap CGI every landing, and incredibly awesome at the same time. I think it's the shiny, unmarked exterior, like a 3D model with a generic texture, or shiny CGI like those in Terminator 2, or The Flight of the Navigator. It also looks like a cheap video game cut scene, hard to believe we're witnessing a tremendous technological achievement."
8-1-1-2,We are truly living in the future
8-1-1-2-1,I think we are actually in the present.
8-1-1-2-1-1,Nah you're living in the past
8-1-1-2-1-1-1,"Actually we are all in the past, there’s an ever so slight delay between our eyes and brain."
8-1-1-2-1-1-1-1,You just need to imagine the event before it happens
8-1-1-2-1-1-4,We're living in a perpetual unfolding of now
8-1-1-2-1-3,We are actually living in the past due to the time it takes the light to reach out eyes and our brains to process it
8-1-1-2-1-4,Time actually has no meaning. It is a construct of our brain and collapsing probability functions because of too much thinking :)
8-1-1-2-1-4-4,Existential crisis triggered.
8-1-1-2-1-4-6,"Hehe, if time has no meaning, how do you explain my kinematics homework?  Time is a dimension."
8-1-1-2-2,Thats 30 tons of payload per trip!
8-1-1-3,There’s a lot less smoke in the movie landings.
8-1-1-5,">Every single time I watch a landing I think, 'that's exactly how a spaceship in a movie would land'. Yup. When I was a kid watching old '50s sci fi movies in between live Gemini launches I expected real rockets would start to land soon. The first F9 booster landing thrilled me beyond words. These twin landings are unreal - but real.>Is this real life?Someone should write a rock opera about that."
8-1-2,It's impressive to me how good they are getting at this technique now. It feels like it was only yesterday that Space-X was testing Falcon-9 First-stage landing. Scary to think that was 7 years ago - makes me feel old.
8-1-2-3,"Say what you will about musk, but the engineers at SpaceX are phenomenal"
8-1-4,Still can't get over how this just looks like CGI. Amazing!
8-1-4-1,"Was gonna say it looks like CGI, always thought the CGI with rockets looked off or weird in movies, but it seems that's just how it looks IRL"
8-1-5,"Same, the future is now and it is amazing."
8-2,Re-using rocket boosters is incredible.Landing them upright on a pad is amazing.Landing two of them side-by-side at the same time in view of a single camera is absolute astonishing.
8-2-1,What I think is most incredible is that it shows they understand incredibly well how to control something so complicated with mind blowing precision.
8-2-1-1,So complicated? Pssht it's hardly rocket science
8-2-1-1-1,"Yeah, rocket science is simple.Rocket engineering on the other hand..."
8-2-1-1-1-1,Don't get me started on rocket surgery...
8-2-1-1-1-1-1,Should we not start with rocket biology?
8-2-1-1-2,"Not exactly brain surgery though, is it?"
8-2-2,"It really is astonishing! I grew up in Cocoa Beach, been watching launches all my life, and it's just unbelievable compared to when we were watching the boosters fall into the ocean!"
8-2-3,"> Landing two of them side-by-side at the same time in view of a single camera is absolute astonishing.so thats not really a feat but it is a spectacle. the feat is landing one, once you have that capability everything beyond that is showboating. spacex is REALLY good at showboating. all that said, this is badass x10."
8-2-3-1,Landing on a barge in the middle of the ocean is showboating /s
8-2-3-1-5,"yes it is. because landing anywhere is the capability, landing in exotic locations is just like landing at a launch pad from the perspective of the guidance system. it doesnt care if you are landing on a concrete pad in the middle of Texas or on a carbon steel pad being held up by polar bears and seals in the Arctic ocean... A flat surface is a flat surface."
8-2-3-2,Next *feat* I would like to see is a sub-24 hour turnaround.
8-2-3-2-1,"I would like to see hot turnarounds like their Starship promo rendering... Booster lands back, refuels, restacks, relaunches. Just like a commercial airliner. If they can make space travel boring... well that would be a hell of a feat."
8-2-3-4,Its worth pointing out that landing a rocket vertically was achieved in the 1970s and SpaceX are likely going to profit from tech which was developed with US Taxpayer money and sold off in a fire sale during the NASA funding drought.
8-2-3-4-1,"Source? A quick Google search shows that there was research done and some failed attempts in the 1960s and further. But the first vertical landing was 2015 by Blue Origin.Also it's not just about vertical landing, it's also the reusability of the parts and how that reduces cost by a huge factor."
8-2-3-8,">the feat is landing one, once you have that capability everything beyond that is showboating.Is it though? Wouldn't it take incredibly precise maneuvers to ensure that the two don't collide while landing side by side?I know very little about rockets but I refuse to believe that it is just showboating"
8-3,"I will never forget when I was at the beach and saw the boosters land for the first time, it looked as unreal in real life as it does in the video."
8-3-2, possibly my most watched video on YouTube
8-3-2-1,What an amazing nerdgasm! Love the collective joy of so many brilliant and dedicated SpaceX staff...
8-3-2-3,This is mine - Set to the music it's absolutely perfect.
8-3-2-6,"16M views, yet under 70K subscribers.  Yowza."
8-4,I can’t think of anything that inspires internal wonder like watching this. It gets me every time. I can’t explain it. I’ve seen similar dual landings before. Why does every time feel like an inspiration?
8-4-1,"Imagine seeing that in person, as it pops through the cloud cover at speed?  I get goosebumps thinking about it."
8-4-1-1,"I got to see the previous Falcon Heavy launch/landing in person from the causeway. The one thing that caught me off guard was the speed they come in at. The livestreams don't really give you a good visual sense of how fast they are going right up until the landing burn.I had seen them land plenty of boosters via livestream before, but when I saw them coming out of the clouds, I honestly thought something had gone wrong cuz they were coming in like missiles. Then at the last second the landing burn brings them to a abrupt halt in mid-air."
8-4-1-1-3,They must re-use the same logic in the Model 3 self-driving. Everytime I come up to a red light .... full speed until the last possible second for braking.
8-4-1-1-3-1,"Hell, my Nissan does that too, can't say I care for it, lol. The car knows the ones in front are slowing down, why does it wait so long?"
8-4-1-1-3-2,"Isn't there an option for that, the full-speed stop regenerates the maximum energy back to the battery. You can set it to ""roll"" or something like that."
8-4-1-1-3-2-1,What you are referring to is for manual braking and stopping NOT for self-driving like OP mentioned.
8-4-2,For me it's bc it's exactly how a spaceship from a movie would land. And this makes it feel like one day my childhood scifi dreams might become a reality
8-4-2-1,"Science fiction yesterday, fact today, obsolete tomorrow.Very interested in seeing how we progress from here."
8-4-3,because it's just really that absurdly amazing
8-4-4,"I live on the Space Coast and drove north a bit to get as close as reasonable traffic would allow for the first Heavy launch. After it happened, I mused that landing on the moon may have been the height of human ingenuity, but simultaneously landing 2 rockets virtually back where they took off may just be the height of human intelligence."
8-4-6,Now just imagine that children today will always have lived a life where this is normal. We are going to get so good at this stuff.I'm super high and now I'm getting space inspired ideas. Wow. This is cool lol
8-4-7,Because it looks like something tony stark developed off-screen and is shown on camera the first time. This is like an iron-man movie
8-4-8,I feel like it shows we are evolving!  It gives me hope for the future.
8-5,Great mission today. The fog was a bit much but the launch and dual landing were both beautiful.
8-5-1,I thought something sounded/felt different today. Every single launch shakes my house but this one sounded different. Now I know why
8-5-3,Hey there mod of titan subs
8-6,Never gets old!!Beautiful and I get goosebumps everytime!
8-6-1,So Elon is cool again?
8-6-1-2,Don't know about that but the engineer's etc at spacex certainly are!
8-7,The inner child in me is filled with joy every time i see this. What an amazing achievement.
8-7-1,"My inner child, intermediate teenager and outer adult are all giddy with joy every time i see these landingsDoubly so when it's a falcon heavy"
8-8,So unbelievable. Everyone involved should be very proud
9,Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket explosion rained debris down on ‘pristine’ wildlife refuge
9-1,"More information needed about the FAA environmental assessment and their decision to give SpaceX the green light for the launch.>Last year the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) noted in a 183-page document that SpaceX needed to comply with over 75 mitigation measures ahead of the Starship rocket launch program...  >The FAA’s environmental assessment requested changes from the company such as limiting its noise levels and hiring biologists to assess impacts on local wildlife.>Last week the FAA okayed SpaceX’s test flights saying the company had met all requirements, including safety and environmental."
9-1-1,I suspect that FAA approval came with a few paid grease bearers said it was okay.
9-1-1-5,I suspect this headline came out due to a few greased hands.
9-1-1-5-1,You spend way to much time defending Elon Musk online. He's just another rich asshole and he will never recognize or care that you're so fervently defending him.
9-1-1-5-1-1,"I'm defending truth and rational thought, just so happens Elon is the only rich asshole on the same page."
9-1-1-5-1-1-2,"Wow, Elon as the paragon of truth and rationality. Ive seen it all now."
9-1-2,"Even if they got the greenlight from the FAA they are violating Texas State code. Human activity cant cause dust, smoke, or particulate matter to cross property lines."
9-1-2-1,Is that really a law in Texas of all places? How can you have a campfire or drive on a dirt road without violating it?
9-1-2-1-1,"Can't say for sure in Texas, but many states that use a lot of prescribed fire (southern states) basically have a part in their laws saying that smoke must be a nuisance. That campfire? It's not really much of a nuisance. That 40 acre prescribed fire that someone should have stopped when the winds were not doing what the forecast said they would do? Now you got an issue. Of course, there's more nuance to it than that, but this is the most I'm willing to write while I'm sitting on the crapper."
9-1-2-1-1-1,"Ah, gotcha. So if you have money you can buy your way to officials declaring it ""not a nuisance,"" I assume?"
9-1-2-1-2,"Its technically several regualtions that i just summarized. Generally it needs to be considered a nuisance condition, but that also depends on what permits they have. Dust is pretty clear though, if dust makes it onto someone elses property thats a violation condition. The office i work in has issued violations to construction companies because they were driving trucks up and down a dirt road and covering someones property in dust. They had to use water trucks to control the dust."
9-1-3,"Space x released a giant cloud of ""extra""fuel over northern Canada as well. Looked very cool as it made a spiral in the night sky. Remind me again why going to Mars is so important?"
9-1-3-1,To get away from all the people who can't look past their own nose and are going to ruin the planet.
9-1-3-2,I cannot believe we live in a future where people unironically ask this question.
9-1-3-2-1,
9-1-3-2-1-1,Thanks for this! So relevant still.
9-2,Inhaling aerosolized rocket parts to own the libs
9-2-1,"I hate these articles that say something huge happened but provide no pictures of debris in the wildlife areas.  Journalists, when you do a story like this, show pictures!!!"
9-2-1-6,"If it's the mid-air explosion I'm thinking of they shouldn't be hard pressed to find footage, SpaceX posted what was clearly debris littering a beachside next to a launch site to their twitter."
9-2-1-8,This article has some pictures 
9-3,"Cape canaveral, where all of our greatest missions launched from is also in a massive wildlife sanctuary too. Which makes complete sense as you don't want any development anywhere near a giant rocket launch facility.This is also the reason why long term, starship will also fly from the cape."
9-3-1,"The difference is NASA launched from a sanctuary they created. They bought up a bunch of empty land nobody wanted, zoned out what they needed for infrastructure, then designated the rest as a sanctuary with the Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent anything from being developed there. It wasn't a recognized sanctuary before NASA built the Cape facilities. Boca Chica already had a sanctuary protecting vulnerable species, and Musk built an explosives factory next door."
9-3-1-1,"You have to put your launch facility somewhere. And there are only so many places in the USA that you can safely launch a rocket from. And it's not the 1950s, you can't just buy up hundreds of acres of oceanside property anymore... Can't be too close to population areas. Has to have water to the east, and has to be as close to the equator as possible.I not an Elon fanboi by any stretch, but in this case I don't think critics are being fair.He could have done more to contain launch thrust on site for sure."
9-3-1-1-1,"I agree it make sense from SpaceX's perspective, but it's dumb to pretend that the wildlife refuge was anything but forfeited once the local government allowed them to build there.  If protecting wildlife was actually the priority, SpaceX should have been turned down."
9-3-1-1-1-1,"Call me dumb but that's actually a question that I have. We know that SpaceX submits environmental assessments and gets an authorization. That process can work, or it can get corrupted and be a rubber stamp. Do we know which is it in this case, have there been serious criticisms that the extent of the impact on the environment is badly assessed and/or unacceptable?"
9-3-1-1-1-1-1,Follow ESG Hound for extensive and meticulous documentation of what's been happening in this case. The process has been deeply flawed and there have been all sorts of soft and hard incentives for things to start getting rubber-stamped. It's very typical lack of regulatory oversight and failures to enforce rules compounded by the fact that the government has a vested interest in keeping SpaceX moving towards delivering on its HLS contract.
9-3-1-1-1-1-1-2,"I read his article on Substack on this matter. Quite the indictment of SpaceX's practices, it's embarassing. Thanks once more for the link.Edit: I don't have any obvious criticisms on the post, but the guy has argued some pretty out there opinions before, including that Starbase is a front for an LNG production plant, which, yeah. Still, I don't  disregard his remarks"
9-3-1-1-1-2,SpaceX is basically NASA. I support NASA and I want SpaceX to succeed.
9-3-1-1-1-2-2,NASA funding was gutted. SpaceX is a private company that NASA had to turn to due to gutted funding. Billionaires lobby for the gutting and then reap the benefits of private space exploration in part funded by the scraps left over to NASA. I hate that people fell for this. I hate that we are getting dystopian world ending space exploration and not Star Trek age of discovery.
9-3-1-1-2,"""The earth will die in the name of progress."" - all you elon musk supporting morons"
9-3-1-1-2-1,"I'm not a fan of Elon.I am a fan of SpaceX as they are realizing the dream of dropping the cost of getting tonnage to orbit by literal orders of magnitude.Like in the first 30 years of SpaceX existing, it's possible that the cost could go down 100x... Which is completrly revolutionary.I hate that Elon has become a crypto and republican supporting libertarian memelord."
9-3-1-1-2-1-1,"Elon’s always been the exact same guy he is now, he just wasn’t in the spotlight so most people didn’t notice"
9-3-1-1-3,"Actually, you don't. SpaceX doesn't need to exist."
9-3-1-1-3-2,We should nationalize it
9-3-1-1-3-2-1,The US already has a space program
9-3-1-1-3-2-1-1,Yes but the technological advances have been great and should be reincorporated into NASA to take back the capitalist aspects and turn it back into pure science. The falcon 9 has been incredibly efficient
9-3-1-1-4,"Can they feasibly elevate the rocket?I assume that once the thrust comes out, that's what propels. They don't need to push against the ground, so if elevating the rocket was doable that's a good idea?"
9-3-1-1-4-1,"I don't know why people are downvoting you, but yeah, they'll build flame deflecting trenches and elevate the rocket. It's weird they didn't yet, and some think they should habe"
9-3-1-1-4-1-1,"Thanks lol30 more feet would help not destroy it right? Or digging a hole under it?My question is do they need the ground RIGHT there to push off of? And that's why they didn't elevate it? The thrust is pushing the rocket as soon as it exits the nozzle right, so they don't need the ground right there?"
9-3-1-1-4-1-1-1,"You are right, they don’t need the ground to push off of, but the relatively low height of the pad allows for much easier access to the engine bay.The pad itself is estimated to be 100 feet off the ground, so I’d expect that they’d need over 100 more to make it “safe” based on images of the launch site."
9-3-1-1-4-2,"Even if they launched at the top of Everest, they would only gain ~9 km of altitude. For reference, they need to fly over water and need a large space to move these vehicles. Launches need to exceed 100 km altitude to reach, but to reach destinations like the ISS, need to reach ~420 km. Beyond this, most of the energy is converted to kinetic energy, which cannot easily be gained by gaining height.So you’d need to find a mountain next to the ocean so it can fly east over the water. It must be relatively flat on top, and cannot exceed certain wind conditions. You’ll need to transport everything up there as well. It just becomes more effective to fly that extra 1 km from whatever imaginary mountain. Than to build there."
9-3-1-1-4-2-1,"No, i mean elevate it like 30 more feet so it doesn't destroy the pad. It won't make a difference right? Because the thrust coming out of the nozzle propels it right? Not the thrust pushing against something?"
9-3-1-1-4-2-1-1,"They could (the Soviet Union did this with the Soyuz), but it would be easier to install the flame diverter they have ready, which would effectively do the same thing with less construction."
9-3-1-1-5,"> Has to have ~~water~~ *emptyness* to the eastFTFY.  This is why Vandenberg AFB in California exists.  As long as there is nothing of value to the East, it can be land there, especially if it’s desert."
9-4,Billionaires can do whatever they want by paying fines and politicians
9-4-3,"Billionaires ran this headline too. Look how incredibly vague the article is. No pictures, no evidence, zero journalism; meaning it's more propaganda."
9-4-3-1,">Look how incredibly vague the article is. No pictures, no evidence, zero journalism...The event just happened. It takes time to collect data and analyze it to ensure accuracy. The article says an investigation is underway and that's all the publicly available information so far. You want them to make shit up? Ask pointed leading questions to get peoples blood pressure up? That's Fox news schtick, real journalists don't do that. >...meaning it's more propaganda.Sounds like you don't understand what is actual propaganda."
9-4-3-2,"Yep, just clickbait meaningless headline capitalizing on anti-Musk sentiment to sell advertisements. Worthless article. Despite very legitimate environmental concerns with space exploration, this article adds absolutely nothing but disinformation."
9-4-3-2-1,"100% agreed and I will add the anti Musk sentiment goes deeper than ad sales. All major news outlets and many of their political allies see Musk as a threat to their livelihood. There's a reason Ford and GM, not Tesla, were invited to the White House to be celebrated as EV pioneers."
9-5,"As a person who is concerned about the environment, this article is very misleading.  The rocket did not begin to tumble ""seconds after impact."". The vehicle's own flight termination system detonated the craft over the Gulf to prevent it from hitting anyone/anything.The debris the article is referring to is mostly concrete and dirt sprayed from the 17 million pounds of thrust aimed directly at the ground during liftoff."
9-5-1,"Which is still a violation of state code, you cant generate dust that leaves the property."
9-5-1-2,"That can't be true, I see that happen literally every day and no one cares.  You probably have to prove the dust created some kind of financial harm to that property."
9-5-1-2-1,"No you dont need to prove financial harm, you need to report it and if its not your property thats being impacted it might not go anywhere. If the entity fights it you need to be willing to come out of anonymity so that TCEQ or the local program can show that a nuisance is being created though."
9-5-1-3,I thought spacex owned a large part of boca chica
9-5-1-3-2,"Their facility footprint is absolutely tiny and crowded for such a massive launch vehicle. Comparing to the launch facilities at Kennedy for space shuttle, Saturn V and falcon really puts things into perspective because that's significantly bigger despite being focused on the launch itself."
9-5-1-3-2-1,Ohk i will look into it i thought it was big enough to be its own city
9-5-1-3-2-1-1,
9-7,"Sad. If at least musk was tied on this rocket, there would have been long term benefits."
9-7-1,"Bud knows better than to trust his own ventures that much. If he's riding a rocket anytime soon, he got it from Bezos or China. (Joke)"
9-7-1-2,You left out the most successful orbital rocket in decades? I'm a big Elon critic but at least get the facts right. Falcon 9 is the only rocket to take humans to orbit from America since 2011.
9-7-1-2-1,"That’s an indictment of NASA, not a credit to SpaceX. SpaceX finally surpassed the capabilities of the vaunted… Soviet Soyuz program.And in the year 2020 of our lord. Big brain genius Elon finally won the space race."
9-7-1-2-1-1,"It IS a credit to Space X. Yes it would have been great if NASA also kept a route to space active in the past decade but changing administration goals largely prevented that. But this is the only private company to develop and operate an orbital rocket to date, and then make it so rapidly reusable and reliable is a HUGE credit to SpaceX. They are the primary driver of low cost orbital access and everyone else is scrambling to catch up to their reusability and affordability. On the other hand, don't let recent issues from Russia take away from the history of the Soyuz program. Soyuz has the longest running streak of crewed launches without a fatality. They have been extremely reliable rockets since first introduced in 1967. Russia has rapidly deteriorated the quality of their space program in recent years, but your comparison is ignorant."
9-7-1-2-1-1-1,So again. SpaceX has matched the capabilities of a Soviet legacy program. NASA should have been doing this all along. The US government funneling money and resources into the private sector instead of NASA does not make what SpaceX has don’t until now some incredible accomplishment. They use a pintle injector engine for gods sake. That’s a 60 year old technology. NASA could have easily been putting crews into space if the entire US budget wasn’t a glorified embezzlement scheme.
9-7-1-2-1-1-1-1,"You're describing another thing SpaceX (and to some degree it's other private competitors) did to revolutionize the space industry. Letting NASA focus on the more complicated issues of deep space exploration and long-term habitation alongside their other objectives of science and earth study, by taking the complex job of getting things into orbit and charging a per unit cost rather than a cost plus contract. Between COGS, Commercial crew, and soon to be commercial habitable satellites, SpaceX and other private companies are literally saving government dollars compared to how we built rockets for the last five decades. And falcon nine is obviously more capable and cheaper than Soyuz. They've reached 200+ orbital launches faster than any rocket in history. The performance speaks for itself."
9-7-1-2-1-2,"F9 is more performant and cheaper than Soyuz. The statement is either ignorant or dishonest.Read the rest of your comments, definitely on the dishonest camp"
9-7-1-2-1-2-1,> F9 is more performant and cheaper than Soyuz.Where did I say otherwise? SpaceX outperformed a program that started in a country that doesn't even exist anymore and hadn't existed for 30 years by the time they launched a 60 year old rocket design. Revolutionary.
9-7-1-3,SpaceX took astronauts to the space station. That ride (Falcon9 + Dragon Capsule) is probably the safest ride up for humans. Definitely safer than the Shuttle.
9-7-1-3-1,I think their point is Elon hasn't ridden it himself yet while Bezos did ride his own rocket.
9-7-1-3-1-1,"I wasn't really trying to make a point. Managed to upset a lot of Reddit rocket scientists, though."
9-8,Nothing is pristine anymore
10,Green light go: SpaceX receives a launch license from the FAA for Starship
10-1,"Fantastic! Witnessed the Best wishes for a successful flight of Starship! Born in the mid 40’s, I’ve witnessed the entire space program to date and look forward to Starship putting man back on the moon and hopefully Mars!"
10-1-1,"Damn, how did your mother carry you around until your 40s?"
10-1-1-1,She was a sturdy woman!
10-1-1-2,They built them a lot stronger back then.
10-1-1-2-1,"You could haul a cord of firewood on that one, she's a keeper"
10-1-2,Wow wow. That's quite the life. I hope this will be as incredible as Apollo.
10-1-2-1,"Yes, me too! I hope I live long enough to see man land on Mars! I flew in the AF and commercially and have over 25,500 flying hours. I wish I could go with them….."
10-2,MONDAY IS ONLY A WEEKEND AWAY! Very rare to actually want a weekend to pass by faster!
10-2-1,I'm 100% fine with it going by at normal speed and just being excited for Monday as well.
10-2-1-1,I'm more of a worrier. I'm expecting someone to file a lawsuit to stop it this weekend.
10-2-1-1-1,Are the courts even open on the weekend?
10-2-1-1-1-1,"Yes, in Texas and any other state,>  If You’re Going After Hours, Make Sure It’s Really An Emergency. From time to time, we are called at nights and on weekends for an emergency TRO. Most of the time, these truly are emergencies. However, occasionally, we will be contacted by lawyers for fairly routine matters that could easily be dealt with the next business day. If you’re going to call a judge at night or on weekends for a restraining order, the wrecking ball had better be ready to knock down your building or the hospital about to pull the plug."
10-2-1-1-1-1-1,"> If you’re going to call a judge at night or on weekends for a restraining order, the wrecking ball had better be ready to knock down your building or the hospital about to pull the plug.No judge is taking that call for this."
10-2-1-1-1-2,"In the past people or groups could petition a judge to issue a stop order until a full court can hold a hearing, usually within a few days. This order is supposed to not be the actual end decision but just to grant the legal system time to actually hear all sides of the issue in contention and decide whether there is a reason to hold a more formal hearing before whatever court or agency."
10-2-1-1-1-2-1,"Not a lawyer, but my understanding is that to get a temporary restraining order, your request is supposed to pass a number of tests. (1) That you would be likely to win when the full case comes to trial. (2) That the TRO does not unnecessarily burden the other party. (3) That the harm you're about to suffer can't be repaired in the future by making the other party pay."
10-2-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Not a lawyer either, although I do know a few pretty well, but from following a number of Keystone Pipeline lawsuits here in Nebraska a lot of government permits were announced on a Thursday or Friday and a lot of injunctions were filed late Friday/early Saturday to contest their validity."
10-3,"Boo!“Starship will not reignite its engines upon atmospheric reentry, nor attempt to make a controlled reentry into the ocean.”That’s the part I was looking forward to lol."
10-3-2,I just want some cameras to see it hit the o-chin
10-3-3,"It will still undergo a controlled reentry though, won't it?"
10-3-3-1,"My understanding is it will be attempting a normal reentry with no attempt of the flip maneuver & landing burn at the end - it will just belly flop at terminal velocity, assuming it survives reentry."
10-3-3-1-1,"Source? I thought they would do the belly flop and landing burn in order to validate that everything works correctly, but out at sea where there are no chopsticks to actually catch it. That way they have a chance to double check that the whole flop manoeuvre works, but their one and only stage zero won't explodes when it inevitably fails."
10-3-3-1-1-1,"That had previously been my understanding as well, but absolutely none of the documentation released, verbiage used, etc by SpaceX suggests that will be the case. All signs point to a belly flop and no more."
10-3-3-2,If it isn't using engines then it is a brick with control surfaces. Depends what your definition of control is. Did they de-orbit on purpose where they meant to? Then yes it was controlled.
10-3-3-2-2,>a brick with control surfacesMore like an aluminum can with control surfaces. Total density is very low.
10-3-3-2-2-1,Stainless steel can.Total density is still very low.
10-3-3-2-2-1-1,"Yeah, I meant in terms of comparing it to an everyday item that people are familiar with, not the material it's made from. I appreciate the correction, though."
10-4,"So this is actually happening, huh?!"
10-4-1,Absolutely!!
10-4-2,nope
10-4-2-1,"Lol why all the hate? All through this thread you are making negative comments. Im stoked this is happening and most likely it will. Yes theres a chance of weather ot a malfunction but we have worked hard to make it happen, and i believe it will. Who knows though, its honestly pretty hard."
10-4-2-1-2,"Because this thing has been promised to do an orbital launch for more than 2 years and it's always happening ""next month for sure"".. At this point I expect it to blow up on the launch pad or soon after clearing, Musk is a con-man. And also I expect more delays to suddenly appear."

11,SpaceX Starship explodes after stage separation fails
11-1,"_rocket does a full 360 loop and wild manoeuvres_""We are awaiting stage separation!""The whole thing is about to disintegrate, but she's still happy and confident."
11-1-1,***explodes****cheering intensifies*
11-1-1-1,I’m so confused by everything here.Why are they testing these rockets so much?Why did they cheer when it blew up?
11-1-1-1-1,"This is the first actual flight test of starship and it’s booster.They are cheering because the mission was successful. Their goal was just to clear the launch tower, everything after that is bonus points and extra data gathering. So it was still a great test."
11-1-1-1-1-1,One of my colleague's partner works at SpaceX. She told me they're straight up partying right now and consider it a wild success.
11-1-1-1-1-1-1,"They must have gotten so much outrageous telemetry from that flight and especially the last minute with the rocket losing engines, fighting the aerodynamics and wildly trying to maintain its course. I find it highly unlikely they can fully simulate a wild ride like that to a high degree of certainty. Now that they have actual data they can calibrate their models for the aerodynamics and engines much better. The whole notion that they made it up so high and so fast (39 km and 2150 km/h) by missing an ever increasing number of engines and not falling out of the sky in the first seconds or outright exploding spontaneously is wild.And to the people saying ""fail!"": Yes, they didn't reach the max Q at the originally intended velocity and altitude but they still made it well into the the supersonic regime. They can extrapolate from this real world data even if it's not fully what they were aiming for in the perfect nominal scenario."
11-1-1-1-1-3,"Mission success! Secretly we were only testing the ignition system. There were a lot of extra experiments and sensors lying around and we wanted to clean up the warehouse, that's why we put it all on the rocket that was totally supposed to explode all along."
11-1-1-1-1-3-1,"Well yes, you think they would risk not getting all the data if by some miracle they were able to complete the entire routine from launch to landing? Sensors cost nothing in the grand scheme of things. Musk even stated before the launch their only real goal was to make it off the launch pad. They’d much rather fail now so they can pinpoint its weaknesses. Falcon 9 went through the same process and look at it now."
11-1-1-1-1-3-3,"Thats how spaceX works, remember falcon 9? Same process. Try try try until you nail it. And now they nail it everytime. This is the most powerful rocket ever made. And it's going to be reusable. They gathered tons of date for the next launch. Rinse and repeat until you nail it. And falcon 9 proofs it works."
11-1-1-1-1-4,">They are cheering because the mission was successfulThere is no reasonable definition by which this mission was successful. The pad is damaged beyond reuse. 3 engines failed immediately and several more failed during ascent, which means both the acceleration and aerodynamic loads during ascent were not representative of a nominal launch. Staging separation failed. It didn't even get to 1% of the kinetic energy for orbit. Much of the ground support equipment was damaged or destroyed.The only way this was ""successful"" was in marketing spin."
11-1-1-1-1-5,Ah yes the “how can we convince investors everything is OK” strategy
11-1-1-1-1-5-1,"SpaceX is a private company and any investor with a brain should know enough about SpaceX to know this is how they develop things, try then try again until you get it right. Falcon 9 had the same process."
11-1-1-1-2,Rocket meant to go high.How high? Not sure.Rocket go higher than we expectedRocket go boomHow high? Higher than we hoped!
11-1-1-1-2-1,Thanks I can understand this now
11-1-1-1-3,Would you prefer less testing?
11-1-1-1-3-1,No - i mean what are they testing for? I’m not a huge space nerd so only know of these constant tests.
11-1-1-1-3-1-2,"Well, better that the rocket explodes while testing than in actual operation, with valuable cargo or maybe humans on board."
11-1-1-1-5,"It's a considerably cheaper launch than NASA. I'm sure it's like a 20:1 ratio. For every 1 nasa launch, Elon could do it 20 times with the same amount of money."
11-1-1-2,"""Your boos mean nothing. I've seen what makes you cheer."""
11-1-1-4,WHY?
11-1-1-4-2,Because the launch was a massive success
11-1-3,It was *supposed* to do the loop... they were experimenting with using centrifugal force to separate the stages rather than the traditional spring-mechanisms or pyrotechnics.Something didn't work.
11-1-3-1,"It was supposed to do a loop, but not quite yet in the process...Reddit scuttlebutt is that it lost hydraulics primary and then backup hydraulics and the flips weren't 100% intentional."
11-1-3-2,"This is the first I hear of it, but from a quick google, my understanding is that it's supposed to be more of a flick than a tumble. But when the stages didn't separate, the rocket just kept spinning and spinning instead."
11-1-3-3,"huh interesting, I can't think of reasons for doing it this way than conventional way tho."
11-1-3-3-1,"They are fond of saying ""no part is the best part"" when it comes to reliability as well as saving weight for more payload.  Spring mechanisms and pyrotechnics can fail, centrifugal force can't.If you start rotating around the CG and separate near the middle, the two halves should move away from each other.You need the release mechanism between the stages either way, and that seems to be what failed."
11-1-3-3-1-1,It clearly can as seen here tho
11-1-3-4,">It was supposed to do the loopWait, WHAT? I've seen so many ""few degrees off and boom"" so I wasn't expecting an ascending rocket doing a loop at Mach 1.something. Well, your explanation clarifies it. I guess I have to apologise to the lady."
11-1-3-4-1,Air resistance makes a huge difference. Doing a slow 180 in 0G is not that bad when you're not being blasted by supersonic winds.
11-1-6,"The clapping infuriated me. NASA nearly lost decades of work because of spacex ""move fast and break things"".Edit: Debris hit a car, on the ground, not his silly tesla in space.No flame trench probably doomed it from the start."
11-1-6-2,...from this test or from an earlier falcon mishap?
11-2,"As someone who has performed that same manoeuvre many time in Kerbal with similar results, I sympathise"
11-2-1,"How often you see a 20 story building do flipity flop without breaking down, repeatedly"
11-2-1-1,Once
11-2-1-1-1,A bunch of marine life in the Gulf of Mexico just learned this the hard way
11-2-1-1-1-1,"Don't worry, all the bits and pieces came down outside the environment."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1,Into another environment.
11-2-1-2,Weekly on The Expanse.
11-2-1-4,"Yes its crazy, it may be the thinner air, not as much resistance/air loads to break it."
11-2-4,"Lol!It was a failure, no?"
11-2-4-1,"No. Their goal was to get away from the pad.They managed. They knew it wouldn't work all the way. SpaceX gonna study this launch, fix everything, then send the next one. And again, and again, untill the technology is perfect.This rocket is so enormous and heavy, no one was 100% sure if it could even fly. This launch was for proof of concept, that it is physically possible.They wanted to at least get away from the pad, otherwise the rocket would have nuked everything around it."
11-3,"Anchors: ""we promised you excitement and we got excitement!""."
11-3-1,"“We sold you the whole seat, but you’re only going to need the edge!”"
11-3-2,Thanks for the Enviromental damage on a failed flight.
11-3-3,"Meh, it's just N-1 all over again, rushed multi engined super heavy not properly tested blowing up midair. I was hoping for reentry desintegration."
11-3-3-1,But this is how they tested Falcon 9 too and look how that turned out. They blew up like 3 or 4 Falcons before we got what we see now. And it they were very clear about this flight being a test.
11-3-3-1-1,"In the space community, every launch is a test, run by a test conductor overseeing the launch conductor. May not for SpaceX."
11-3-3-1-2,"This is also how early Atlas, Thor, Proton, Zenit and other rockets of Cold War era were tested. It's not a new approach by any means. Blow up - Learn - Repeat until it works. Only difference new tech allows for more data and cheaper production and it's investor money (mostly).Would Falcon 9 be a less capable rocket if it used more cautious approach?Can they guarantee that next times Superheavy would clear the pad not blowing up 3 years of infrastructure?"
11-3-3-1-2-1,The pad and tower took nowhere close to three years to put up
11-3-3-1-2-1-1,"Both pad and tower are only parts of infrastructure. They started proper infrastructure development on site back in 2019 and foundation for launchpad started with soil preparation in 2016, which is crucial part of the process.But most of the work was done during 2020-2022, which is 3 years.It is really awesome achievement for the engineering project of this scale, though they cut some corners skipping the trench and proper test stand for booster, which I think would be really handy with such complex engine array and fuel system."
11-3-3-1-2-1-1-1,"Yeah but an explosion wouldn't undo anywhere near that much work. It would be a big boom for sure, but it's not like it would glass the entire starbase or anything. I reckon they'd get it running again within a year in the absolute worst case scenario."
11-3-3-1-2-2,Yeah because it’s really easy not to blow them up? Like don’t you think that if there was a cheaper way to do it without the cost of literally burning money that they or others would? This argument is lacking one critical aspect - reality
11-3-3-2,This *was* the test.  They test by doing it.
11-3-3-2-1,"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, soviets also tested N-1 this way, by doing it. Iterative design isn't a new thing, rather old actually.And I'm not saying it's not effective way or that it didn't have rational arguments. Just that it wasn't ""new"" and so exciting to me. Rockets blowing up is pretty common, especially early in the history of spaceflight. What would be really exciting is to see it reentry, since I don't think we had anything similar before, only capsules and lifting bodies, not a cylinder with flaps."
11-3-3-2-1-1,"Yeah, this is the old-school method of all-up testing...  how NASA and their contractors did things early on, rather than the ""new-space"" method of testing each individual component on its own and extensively simulating their integration.  The simulating sometimes goes well, such as with SLS...  but sometimes you get Starliner.What's ""new"" and ""innovative"" about SpaceX operating like this is that everyone else *stopped* doing it like this long ago."
11-3-3-2-1-1-1,"Starliner was pretty successful so far, showing a lot of redundancy though. If crew was onboard, during both flights they would have landed safely. I'm pretty sure CFT team is pretty confident at this point.And I'm pretty there is many rational reasons why everybody started acting more carefully. Again even though I personally think careful approach is better, I think iterative approach can and should be used for some projects, and for some balanced one is better.For example I think you can have more risk with smaller vehicles and be more careful with bigger ones. More details we had on this launch, more it seems they got really lucky this didn't end badly."
11-4,"It is absolutely crazy that thing the size of a skyscraper was doing flips like that at 2,000+km/hr and didnt break apart sooner. Infact, NASA said the onboard system aborted it, so it could have kept up those aerobatics!?"
11-4-2,"No, it was losing altitude and almost out of fuel."
11-4-2-1,"Rewatch the telemetry data. It was doing 1,700-2,000km/hr its last 15-20 seconds. That is not it's terminal velocity..."
11-4-2-1-1,"No one said anything about terminal velocity, but it was *rapidly* losing altitude, which was intentional so the debris field would be smaller."
11-4-2-1-1-1,Jimmy's comment seemed to imply it was not under power while tumbling. I started terminal velocity because it's not like it was slowing anytime soon. Was still under power.
11-4-2-1-1-2,how would something be intentional while spinning at 2000km/h
11-4-2-1-1-2-1,They were letting it fall as much as possible before activating the FTS.
11-4-2-2,"When a plane is flying over you towards the horizon, it may appear as if going ""down"" when in reality it's just traveling away from you. The same happens with every orbital launch."
11-4-2-2-1,Look at the altitude meter in the lower left corner.
11-4-3,Weird how many identical comments keep mentioning how amazing it is that it didn't explode sooner. Wonder what Elon's social PR team is doing rn..
11-4-3-1,"Some real mental gymnastics there...""SpaceX = Elon Musk, and I'm not allowed to like Elon Musk, so anything the least favorable of anything remotely related to human must be FAKE!""Elon does not need fake PR spreaders. He literally said if it cleared the launch platform it would be a success to SpaceX..."
11-4-3-1-1,">Elon does not need fake PR spreaders.Which is why it's extra weird that he has so many making the same comment with the same phrasing. With fanboys like you, why pay bots?"
11-7,Don't give these people any crap. What they are doing is insane level hard. They know what they are doing and this is what success looks like. Incremental goals achieved with lessons learned on the way.I know from my living room I cannot design a rocket that will go to the moon. I don't think anyone who comments here can either. Today was a win for spaceflight.
11-7-2,In this case the only fail for spaceflight would be do nothing at all? Honest question
11-7-2-1,Yup they learned thier separation system isn't reliable/redundant enough which once an analysis of the on board camera plus any recovery will allow them to make design revisions. Plus all the telemetry and data from sensors will allow computer models to be updated.If they didn't launch they wouldn't have all this new data.
11-7-2-1-1,"The main engines never turned off--there's no way they can separate while there's still thrust being applied. Also, the first stage didn't get close to where it needed to be before stage separation was supposed to happen (probably due to so many engine failures during takeoff and ascent). That's probably why the main engines didn't turn off, they were still trying to get the rocket where it was supposed to be before separation.There's probably additional issues, but my guess is the stage separation never had a chance of succeeding due to the other problems that happened during the launch. Despite what the hosts were saying, the rocket might not have even attempted to separate due to its trajectory being so far off."
11-7-2-1-1-3,Failure.
11-7-2-1-2,"Cool! Too bad people don't understand this, right? Not every data is on Google to be searched"
11-7-2-1-2-1,Calculations can only be so complex. Sometimes the best way to get answers is testing in the real world. This is why projects especially large projects take time as assumptions need to be changed once the project is built and data is gathered.
11-7-2-1-4,Was it a separation system fault? I'm pretty sure it wasn't designed to operate at this levels of stress due to loss of gimball authority. I think what they learned is their booster engine section isn't reliable enough.
11-7-2-1-4-1,The likely case was an issue with reaching the correct height for separation. My understanding is that starship does not have a traditional separation system but instead performs a special decoupling maneuver to flick the first stage away. The issue the internet sleuths seem to agree on was a failure to reach the correct height for stage separation and engine cutoff. It could be due to some damage from the pad debris while taking off.
11-7-2-1-4-1-1,"Sounds plausible, thanks!"
11-7-2-2,A fail would it not lighting at all or just immediately exploding on the pad. But in reality those scenarios would still be incredibly important information for design and system development.They successfully launched a rocket with twice the power of the SATURN V. So they now have the record for the most powerful rocket to successfully launch. And they only had 5 engines flare out.  So they did it with  a 15% engine failure rate. Incredibly robust.
11-7-2-2-1,>And they only had 5 engines flare outOnly?That's a spectacular failure. They lost 10% of their engines immediately off the pad. In what universe is that a *good* thing?
11-7-2-2-1-1,"Remember, this was the first attempt at a actual launch. 15% loss of engines is a large amount, yet It STILL got past Max Q and made it SUCCESSFULLY to stage separation. The only critical failure experienced was the failure to separate which then  caused flight termination.The goal of getting off the pad was successful. All the data from the nanosecond fuel loading started is incredibly valuable. They can now work to improve the raptor engines. Just like they did from the data from the engine flare outs while testing the starship prototypes on their hop and landing tests. Those raptor engines dropped like flies.Edit: also keep in mind. This is nowhere close to human flight.  So it's good they are getting flame outs now and are able to examine and resolve it now instead of when we are actually loading humans into this thing."
11-7-3,the people hating just dont understand how SpaceX operates. they have 3 more starships ready to go and they work in iterative design. Its not like NASA where they get one true shot and everything has to be perfect for go. SpaceX makes messes on purpose so they can improve through trial and error.How many Falcon 9 explosions did we see once upon a time? They land autonomously about once every other week now. And not to mention how many early explosions did NASA experience? This just comes down to blind hatred of Elon.
11-7-3-2,"I feel like Elon is an entirely separate issue.  You can love him or hate him or perhaps have a more nuanced view of him, but in the end it's all about the history changing technology that's playing out in real time."
11-7-3-2-1,I just feel like a lot of this has to do with Elon because if/when starship lands on mars there will be people saying elon had nothing to do with it. And yet today he had everything to do with the explosion. Neither take is fair but some people just can’t stand anything he’s associated with
11-7-3-2-1-1,"He has gone a little unhinged the past few years.  Whether you agree with his views or not seems to be a separate issue from the success/failure of his various companies.  I hope the space and electric car ventures continue to succeed.  Twitter or Titter can fail for all I care, but that's a whole 'nuther issue."
11-7-3-2-1-1-1,For sure. I wouldn’t disagree elon brought on a lot of his detractors himself. It’s just a shame it’s brought into SpaceX achievements.
11-7-3-2-1-2,"Curious how you think the rocket failing was Elon's fault. He's not some cartoon villain with a big red launch button.All evidence points to damage from the pad going...everywhere as being the culprit. They thought they could get away with the set up they had, and the only way they would find out is by firing 33 full power raptors at the pad.By the time you try to make a test setup for that, its better to just try a launch and get the extra data from the full stack."
11-7-3-2-1-2-1,I don’t think it was his fault at all. I think that’s an absurd claim to make. But people who clearly hate Elon have made that claim. That’s what I was talking about
11-7-3-2-1-2-1-1,"My bad, misunderstood your comment"
11-7-3-3,"I think a big problem is also that Elon has lost a lot of public goodwill with his Twitter antics, so people are having a kneejerk reaction to clown on anything remotely associated with him. Sure, it was a problem before because stupid people will always exist, but now they've been joined by people who *want* Elon, and therefore SpaceX by extension, to fail.It's a damn shame, because as much of an absolute clown as Musk is, SpaceX has been doing incredible work for the space industry and is a big reason the sector is as healthy as it is today."
11-7-3-6,Privatization of space exploration will only end badly there no possible good future when there's the potential for one man to have a practical monopoly on space while we continue to ignore public institutions like NASA
11-7-3-6-3,NASA would still be paying the Russians for rides to the ISS if it wasn't for SpaceX.
11-7-3-6-4,> for one man to have a practical monopoly on space Too bad there aren't any other private space companies. Oh wait.> we continue to ignore public institutions like NASAGuess who's probably NASA's most important contractor at this point.
11-7-6,"I have designed thrust sections and propellant tanks that have gone to the moon and beyond. The structures is the easy part and there was no point in SpaceX having so many structures failures unless the decided they were smarter and didn’t need to look at past design information. The guidance and software are entirely multiple levels of difficulty to achieve success, but their structures failures are just unforgivable given the existing tools, testing techniques, and data available today."
11-7-6-1,"Not to discount your experience which is more than I have but, aren't they designing this different from a traditional rocket body and fuel tank section?Previous rockets were designed to be sacrificial and one time use. What they are doing is the opposite. So they kind of have to design from ground up and experience structural failures as they march towards a rocket where the booster AND second stage are reusable while having twice the power of a Saturn 5, with a 32 engine first stage.That's different from a structure and fuel tank that has to withstand and survive the stress of launch ONCE that never have to encounter hypersonic re-entry, deceleration, landing in one piece, recovery, refurbishment, fueling, loading, repeat. Many times over.So I think starting from scratch and relearning some lessons is better than basing off previous knowledge, only to learn down the road ""oh this won't work. It wasn't ever designed with this in mind.""Edit: words"
11-7-7,"I dont really get it? Sure, data for incremental tests are cool, but now youve got however much cost sunk in an exploded rocket, as well as a bunch of debris just around, that Im SURE Musk is dying to pay for to clean up. I guess is there documented cases of NASA just exploding test rockets for something like this? Is there a precedent?"
11-7-7-2,You are just a hater who has no clue what you are talking about
11-7-7-2-1,"I'm skeptical that when something big explodes that its a good thing. Then I asked if big things exploding was normal. Big explosion = bad, if you didnt know. A nicer more forgiving and helpful person gave me some reference, instead of just saying im a hater."
11-8,"Well, that plus a somewhat alarming number of engine failures...Seriously wondering if the decision to not have a flame trench and a full-scale deluge system is starting to bite them in the ass now that the launch site is seeing full power engine blast."
11-8-1,I'm assuming it's because the pad absolutely obliterated some of the engines. When you've got chunks of concrete totalling cars over a km away you know you're probably goofed. Fix the pad issues and I imagine some of those problems go away.
11-8-2,"Ultimately starship has to take off from Mars though, using the same raptor engines. If you can get the booster to take off from earth without special infrastructure, taking off from Mars is easy. And it needs to be easy, because if it doesn't work, there's no way home.Getting Raptor engines reliable in takeoff from a basic pad is harder than building a fancier pad. But worthwhile in the bigger picture."
11-8-2-1,"Yeah, but the sheer scale of the difference makes them totally incomparable to each other.  Starship is VAAAAAAAAAAAAAASTLY less powerful than Super Heavy.  The amount of damage it can do to a surface is orders of magnitude less.  Not to mention that there's literally ZERO chance of Super Heavy needing to lift off without prepared infrastructure support.  So why risk so much on testing something that literally cannot happen?It's like comparing a really good windy storm with an EF5++ tornado - sure it's all just wind, but they're very, VERY different threats!"
11-8-2-1-1,"Super heavy certainly is more powerful, but it's not orders of magnitude. 6 raptors vs 33. So it's 5.5x more powerful."
12,Europe eyes Musk's SpaceX to replace Russian rockets
12-1,It also doesn’t help that Ariane 6 was delayed into 2023.
12-1-1,And has less thrust and costs more per launch than Falcon Heavy
12-1-1-1,"What is a ""falcon super heavy""?"
12-1-1-1-1,3 Falcon Heavies strapped together.
12-1-1-1-1-5,We Kerbaling this thing?
12-1-1-1-2,"Its three Falcon 9's strapped together.Edit: FFS reddit. This is in the second sentence on its wiki page, please do a tiny bit of research before downvoting. >  The rocket consists of two strap-on boosters made from Falcon 9 first stages, a center core also made from a Falcon 9 first stageLiterally 3 falcon 9's strapped together. "
12-1-1-1-2-1,Pretty sure that's a Falcon Heavy.
12-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Right; there is no such thing, but FH does technically qualify as a super heavy since it can carry over 50 tonnes to orbit.They really need a classification for over 100 tonnes."
12-1-2,How do you pronounce Ariane?
12-1-2-2,"Better question, how do you pronounce Arianespace?"
12-1-2-2-1,"Same as the comment I left above and space is pronounced like in English except the ""a"" sound is like when you ""ah yes""."
12-1-4,Ariane 6 is already obsolete
12-1-4-1,You're in every thread saying anything that isn't spacex is obsolete. Why?
12-1-4-1-6,Because he’s a Muskrat. There is a huge cult of personality around him and his companies.
12-1-4-1-6-4,I love SpaceX and I even appreciate Elon Musk for what he does with his companies (not the other stuff). I hate the annoying fanboys though.
12-1-4-1-7,"Non reusable. Do you throw away your car after each drive? That's what Ariane 6 will be doing, almost 10y after spaceX started working on reusability"
12-1-4-1-7-1,"You mean like the Spaceshuttle, almost 50 years before spaceX?"
12-1-4-1-7-1-1,The space shuttle was not resusable. It was refurbishable. An unfortunately very large difference.
12-1-4-1-7-1-1-2,"Technicalities. The Big Orange tank was lost every time, but also the upper stage of falcon 9 is lost too (and sometimes the fairings, and sometimes even the lower stage, when lifting things to specific orbits. Not really 100% reusable either. The shuttle was reused, the boosters were too.Do you really want to start a game of nitpicking details?A private company using a proven concept of 50 years ago with a lot of government funding is not really that big of an achievement..*EDIT: better use of words**EDIT 2: Why not rename r/space to r/MuskiesFellows?*"
12-1-4-1-7-1-2,"Oh the space shuttle ? The most expensive launch vehicle by an order of magnitude that threw away everything but the orbiter, had 20000 tiles that had to be serviced by hand and was so unsafe that only killed 14 people by sheer luck? Yeah technically reusable but why bother at this point. And had nothing to do with ESA/europe"
12-1-4-1-7-1-2-1,"Hey, you were the one hot for reusability..."
12-1-4-2,"In some ways yes, but more options never hurt.If only one launch company is being relied upon, what happens when they have a major incident and have to ground their fleet for an extended period of time? The Space Shuttles flew almost 100 missions between 1988 and 2003 before all flights were suddenly halted for over two and a half years because of Columbia. Same with Challenger.There are also a few reasons why different options may be preferred for some launches. For example, the JWST was launched on a Ariane 5 because (among other reasons) it was actually cheaper for NASA to do so since the ESA didn't charge anything - instead they're getting ""paid"" by being granted observing time on the telescope. That's not something other launch companies could have offered."
12-1-4-3,Sure but it is still an improvement on the Ariane 5.Let’s just hope that when the time comes to design the Ariane 7 that ESA and ArianeSpace look towards SpaceX for inspiration.
12-2,"After expanding NATO, Putin manages to expand SpaceX's  customer base"
12-2-1,This is obviously Musk’s 20-year plan for revenge after he was denied purchasing a decommissioned Russian ICBM /s
12-2-1-1,"You laugh, but Russia has been Elon's enemy for years. From creating EVs (a detriment to russia's fossil fuel economy) to competing with the Soyuz before the war, to talking shit about the head of the russian space program (who was a dolt who threatened the US with access to Soyuz by saying 'use a trampoline if you don't want to comply), Elon's been on Putin's shitlist for awhile now, and likely part of Russia's troll farm misinformation campaigns."
12-2-1-2,That would be weird and darkly hilarious if true. But I'm pretty sure he's only an incidental Bond villain. I don't think it was ever the plan.
12-2-1-2-1,No one plans to be a villain. The test is whether you can turn back once you realize you've crossed the line. True villains continue onward.
12-2-1-2-1-1,"> No one plans to be a villain.That's my thought. Unlike the movies, circumstances make the villain. Or one slowly finds one's self doing more Bond-villain type things out of circumstance, like launching rockets from a remote tropical island..."
12-2-1-2-2,"You are calling elon musk a bond villian for enjoying russia's demise?Russia did it to themselves, musk is a spectator like everyone else and has every right to enjoy their downfall.   They physically spit on him and bullied him when he went there."
12-2-1-2-2-1,"I'm making fun of the idea that he is kind of an incidental Bond villain. Dating stars, launching rockets from remote tropical islands, buying decommissioned oil rigs to launch rockets, showing up the efforts of powerful nations, planning a city on Mars....    But his initial endeavors were quite modest. (Multiple) Industry domination and becoming the world's richest person were never part of the plan.  Now he just needs a profile picture with him holding and petting a fluffy white cat at this point.  Why so serious?"
12-2-1-2-2-1-1,He hasn't done anything bad yet.  So why so serious?Demonizing someone baselessly is not trivial.
12-2-1-2-2-1-1-1,"No, he hasn't done anything bad. Other than given preliminary vocal support for DeSantos but I don't agree with lots of people politically, so IDGAF really.    I'm *not* being serious. His situation is quite hilarious actually. If others in government and the auto and space industries were not so perpetually backward thinking, he would likely never have found this level of success."
12-2-2,"It is pretty funny. If nothing happened, countries would probably be fine with buying Russian rockets for another few decades, just out of convenience. Putin managed to lose a decent revenue stream."
12-3,I imagine going forward cost alone would be grounds to use SpaceX. The cost of a falcon 9 launch is a fraction of any competitors both private and governmental.
12-3-1,"SpaceX's costs are a likely significantly lower, but they're not selling their rockets at cost. Still a bargain,  but they do need profit to advance their goals."
12-3-2,Who is the other private provider?
12-3-2-1,United Launch Alliance and Arianespace. Virtually all western launch providers are private industry.
12-3-2-1-1,is ULA price competitive? I was under the impression that they're propped up almost exclusively on govt funding and cant win contracts on cost
12-3-2-1-1-1,I think their track record is the reason why too
12-3-2-1-1-1-1,Only provider with a 100% success rate over 145 launches. SpaceX has 98.8% over 171 launches.
12-3-2-1-1-3,ULA is the USA’s contractor swamp dog.Arriane is the EU’s contractor swamp dog.Roscosmos is Russias contractor swamp dog.They continue to exist due to charity contracts from their benefactor countries.Spacex beats all of them because they simply had to to survive.
12-3-2-1-1-4,"Hence ""the cost of a Falcon 9 launch is a fraction of any competitors."""
12-3-2-1-1-8,"ULA is Lockheed and Boeing telling the government they would be much more competitive as a single monopoly, and the government fell for it. They got all military contracts so they could be as fat as they wanted."
12-3-2-2,"Rocket lab, Astra, virgin orbit, Northrop Grumman, ULA, and a few more obscure ones."
12-3-2-2-1,Rocket lab and Virgin are not really competing with SpaceX. They are only for very small satellites.
12-3-2-2-1-1,"Rocket lab is working on a much bigger rocket than electron though, neutron."
12-3-2-2-2,"Northrop Grumman technically has a rocket that can launch to orbit, but it will only work for ISS and maybe SSO, not for GTO or anything else really. Rocket Lab, Astra, and Virgin Orbit are all small rockets, not large enough for many payloads."
12-3-2-2-2-1,"Northrop Grumman have two first stages left, then they are buying three Falcon 9 flights, then hopefully Firefly can deliver on a new first stage for them. So they won't have one to sell even if they wanted to for 5 years."
12-3-2-2-3,"Not sure you heard, but Astra is basically dead in the water.   Another failed launch and then they're transitioning off a rocket they never really managed to get right."
12-3-2-2-3-1,"SoaceX also abandoned falcon 1 after only 3 successful launches. They were also in a harder time period with the 2008 financial crisis. Today, Astra has a stock listing. All they need is another NASA/DARPA contract and they will be fine."
12-3-2-2-3-1-2,The difference being the SpaceX had their rocket working and had an engine that could easily be used for a larger rocket. They also had a very large very important NASA contract.Astra just spend 200+ million on a rocket and is essentially developing a new rocket because they couldn't get their rocket to work.
12-3-2-2-4,"Spinlaunch! Just watched a video on their plans, super interesting!"
12-3-2-2-4-1,"Will never work on earth, maybe on the moon"
12-3-2-3,"There are many, but few in SpaceX's capability range yet. ULA, Arianespace (technically), Northrup Grumman, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, Firefly, Astra, Relativity Space, etc.Most of those companies are working on vehicles in the Falcon 9 payload range which should come into service in the next few years."
12-3-4,"Cost doesn’t really matter to them, Europe just wants to have at least one domestic rocket company for National Security reasons. They’ll try to reduce costs, but by innovating themselves. They need a their own rocket."
12-3-6,"There's a reasonable argument for still giving some business to other launch providers, but SpaceX should definitely be the primary contender for being the main provider."
12-3-6-1,"When people following SpaceX were talking about how SpaceX was building a competitive moat that would put them ten years ahead of their competition...this is what that looks like. While it's dangerous to have only a sole-source provider for launches...at this point, you're paying to subsidize outmoded technology. And honestly, no other competitor is even realistically working towards reusability right now; lots of paper designs, some initial testing, but nothing remotely close to approaching what SpaceX has done, and that's before taking into account Starship, which itself is further along than essentially all other competition poking at their first pass at reusability.To be honest, SpaceX might be close to 20 years ahead of the competition at this point, because nobody has really even started trying to compete on this modern mode of space access."
12-3-6-1-1,"I say this as someone who doesn't really know these things, but isn't Blue Origin close with its reusability of New Shepard and (hopefully) New Glenn? It seems the downside to Blue Origin's model (as opposed to SpaceX) is that SpaceX embraces failure and the ""try and try again"" until you get it right, while Bezos seems to want each launch and test to go perfectly.But outside of Blue Origin, it sure doesn't seem like anyone else is really embracing reusability - which we all know is the future. And once Starship is viable, it's really game over for a while."
12-3-6-1-1-1,"New Shepard is already demonstrating good reuse but you have to remember it's only used for suborbital hops which isn't comparable to putting payloads in orbit (most importantly, the re-entry heating loads and the landing margins) so it's not that great for extrapolating to New Glenn.  We can't say much for certain about New Glenn because BO keeps it under wraps and it's many months away from first flight, maybe more than a year.  However given their demonstrated slow pace on it and the BE-4, and that its initial launch cadence is probably going to be low I have strong doubts about their ability to recover, much less reuse, Glenn in the first year or two.  I do hope they succeed (and they likely will eventually) because mo' space is betta space but so far they talk bigger than they walk."
12-3-6-1-1-2,"Blue origins is old space with fresh paint of coat, their BE-4 engine delays were caused by shitty managment, program was hardware poor, basically they didn't have enough parts to build engines. New shepard is doing great so far but it's just a prototype doing tests with live subjects. And New Glen is in very early stages of development if compared to spacex it hasn't reached starhopper milestone. Just big bulky tank. And all thanks to Jeff and his lack of focus on Blue origin."
12-3-6-2,There are no other options besides SpaceX really. The other ones they mentioned; India doesn't have available capacity unless they are willing to push back their own schedules and Japan's next gen rocket isn't ready yet and its manifest looks pretty full to me.Falcon's reusability allows far more launch schedule flexibility than anyone else has. They are launching like crazy right now
12-3-6-2-1,"> There are no other options besides SpaceX reallyULA??? SpaceX and ULA are direct competitors, and there is more than enough launches to go around for both of them.Blue Origin is to be 3rd in line to compete with the big two. Only time will tell if they will be a worthwhile competitor.RocketLab is the largest of the small-launch providers. They have no direct competition at this time and they are highly successful. They just recently launched the NASA CAPSTONE satellite and at this stage it's a 100% success in all stages.Astra, Firefly, Relativity Space and a few others I forgot are the next players in the game, but they compete amongst themselves."
12-3-6-2-1-1,"I was obviously talking about options *that will fill Europe's temporary needs*Atlas is sold out, Vulcan doesn't exist yet and is sold out anyways. New Glenn doesn't exist yet. Neutron doesn't exist yet. Firefly and Relativity have never put so much as a paperclip into orbit and their launchers are too small even if they had. Astra looks like they are going out of business and their launcher is too small. India's launchers are all spoken for as are Japans unless they make some huge schedule shifts. The partnership with Russia (as well as Euro Soyuz) is now ancient history and they won't use China for obvious reasons.So yes. SpaceX is their only real option. You don't even need to take my word for it, its right there in the article you didn't read"
12-3-7,I don't know if they are considering India Their rockets are very cheap. They don't quite win over spaceX for cost per kg and but they are in the ballpark. They are not in the ballpark on reliability though.
12-3-7-1,>I don't know if they are considering India Their rockets are very cheap.At that point ESA and Arianespace might aswel wait for Ariane 6 to be operational.Which hopefully should happen in early 2023.Also Arianespace still has the Vega-C so it’s not like they don’t have options but for bigger payloads they have to find a temporary solution until Ariane 6 is ready.And SpaceX is arguably best suited for that purpose.
12-3-7-2,I’m from Florida and we’re watching a falcon 9 launch weekly right now… there’s never been a more reliable space company.
12-3-7-3,I think its about having available rocket cores. All non-SpaceX rocket companies have fixed rates at which they can build new rockets which is ultimately the limiting factor on how often they can launch. They just can't make new cores available on short notice without pushing back a ton of other launches.SpaceX doesn't have that problem because they are only limited by how fast they can refurbish their first stage and the second stage is relatively simple and quick to build by comparison.
12-3-7-3-1,The big picture with spaceX is the fact that like 1/2 their flights are their own starlink and can be moved on a few days notice.
12-6,I really hope SpaceX has at least 1 decent competitor in the coming years so that innovation continues to be driven. At it looks at the moment SpaceX is going to waltz away with the industry.
12-6-1,> At it looks at the moment SpaceX is going to waltz away with the industryThey're still driving tremendous innovation for now.
12-6-1-1,"Yeah which is good, but there is still competition of some sort. If they keep going at this rate and the rest of the industry still does nothing then that might not be the case in 5-10 years. If the competition dissappears there will be less drive to innovate.I'm really hoping rocketlab get neutron up and new Glenn gets going as those are the only two feasible competitors  to spacex at the moment"
12-6-1-1-3,Starship being reliable fully reusable even if only for cargo would start really Trust Busting worries. They’d literally make every other rocket company worthless.
12-6-2,"Spacex really doesn’t seem to have that issue, it’s not *really* a for profit company, I’m sure any left over money is just put back in, and it’s founded on innovation, they’re about to launch the biggest rocket ever made and it’s 100% reusable after all. Definitely the benefit of a privately run company"
12-6-3,"Yeah, right now Blue Origin is more of a litigation company than a space company. It is disappointing that SpaceX has no real competition, even if they're doing great work right now. If SpaceX goes belly up for some reason, the whole Western world will be set back years. It's risky having all our eggs in one basket."
12-6-4,"In this case, SpaceX is good for the rest of the space industry. The phrase ""competition is good"" does not necessarily best apply to the leader in the space. The leader is setting the bar for the rest of the industry to catch up. Regardless of whether SpaceX succeeds or fails, at this point, them doing what they are doing is and will be very good for the industry.Expect pretty much everyone to have their own version of Starship in 20 years."
12-6-6,"I mean... ArianeSpace is a decent competitor. Their rockets are reliable and well proved. Sure Ariane 6 is getting delayed, but if it's as reliable as the 5, it will be a success"
12-6-6-1,Having a reliable rocket that you launch a handful of times a year doesn't really make you competitive with SpaceX these days
12-6-6-1-1,Not to mention that it's definitely not more reliable than a falcon 9. It has had 2 complete failures and 3 partial failures in just 113 launches. The block 5 falcon 9 has launched 114 times and has had no failures.
12-6-6-2,"The ariane 5 isn't really more reliable than the falcon 9 though, the falcon 9 in general has less failures for significantly more launches, and the block 5 variant hasn't had a single failure. Bear in mind that the block 5 variant has flown 114 times, and the ariane 5 has flown 113 times and has has 2 complete failures and 3 partial failures."
12-7,"This is wild considering how many years Stephane Israel + the rest of ESA spent mocking, dismissing, and bemoaning SpaceX."
12-7-2,"Dismissing and bemoaning (which is normal when someone is trying to take your turf), maybe, but I don't remember him ever mocking SpaceX"
13,21 SpaceX Starlink satellites ready for launch.
13-1,What does a single unit look like?
13-1-1,"There are no official pictures of one unfolded, but it seems to be a flat metal square with one foldable solar array sticking up."
13-1-1-1,what are the speakers for>?!
13-1-1-1-2,I think they are reaction wheels?
13-1-2,[Something like this]
13-1-2-1,"That's actually a V1 sat, these are V2 mini and look a fair bit different. More square."
13-4,I really could use a banana for scale.
13-4-2,You can use mine
13-4-2-1,"But then they would seem way bigger than they are, wouldn't they"
13-4-2-1-1,Yes. Yes they would.
13-4-2-1-1-1,It's not small it's just far away
13-5,Remember that scene from one of the recent star wars movies with the bombs hanging in a ship and getting dropped?
13-8,These are supposed to be a newer smaller model but the old model they were putting upwards of 60 into one rocket. I wonder why they only launched 21 in this volley?
13-8-1,"They are a newer model, but they are not smaller than the old ones. They are smaller than what is planned to launch on starship, which is going to be much bigger than falcon9"
14,SpaceX fires up all 6 engines of Starship prototype ahead of orbital test flight (video)
14-1,I’ve randomly caught live streams of them doing these tests. Pretty dang exciting to watch progress. The orbital test flight is gonna be bonkers.
14-1-1,Do you know if there is any word on when the test will be yet?
14-1-1-1,"They still have to test fire all 33 engines on the booster, so far they've only done around 3. They also need a launch license but usually that comes though right before the launch. Hopefully in the next few weeks."
14-1-1-1-1,"Launch license basically just ensures that the proper authorities can clear the area in case of a big boom, as well as to check all trajectories to make sure it doesn't hit planes or satellites.  There will probably also be some kind of other inspections as well with it."
14-1-1-1-1-1,"Well, I think they are flying in Texas bc they couldn't get a license in Cali. So, I don't think it was quite as simply, this time around."
14-1-1-1-1-1-1,"They are flying in boca chica because it's on an eastern shore, and that's idea for launches. Cali works if you want to launch polar, but not for other launches."
14-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Also south Texas is closer to the Equator, which is more efficient.  Boca Chica is like 2 miles from the Rio Grande.  There's nowhere on the Florida coast left besides Merritt Island, because it is all built up now."
14-1-1-2,"No. The launch license is a \*big deal\* as the FAA is responsible for protecting human life and property on the ground.This is the biggest rocket anybody has ever built, it's brand-new, and it's launching from a new launch site that is close to a fair chunk of population. The FAA will be very careful with this one, as they rightly should be."
14-2,Seeing 33 raptors firing at once is going to be amazing
14-2-1,"They didn't hold back with this one.  First time having six fire at once, right?  And then the test lasted like 8 seconds.  Or anyway more than twice the normal duration.One thing that confuses me though.  Is the ground around the pad made of pure sand or something?  Where is all of that kicked-up dirt coming from?  Can't they clean it up in advance?"
14-2-1-3,"It looks like dirt, but it's almost entirely steam. They have a huge water deluge system built into the test pad. It releases tens of thousands of gallons of water during ignition. I think it's just the time of day and the angle of the sun that is causing the steam to look the colour that it is."
14-2-1-3-2,What? Where are you seeing water...this is debris.
14-2-2,"""Jurassic World 24:  Why did we give them guns?"""
14-3,"Stupid question perhaps, but how do they hold these guys down? Is there a gantry strong enough to resist the thrust, or do they maybe just put a payload just heavy enough to exceed the maximum thrust? (or other)"
14-3-2,"They stand on a massive steel stand and are bolted down completely. Search for ""Starship test stand"" to find images of it"
14-3-5,"For the orbital launch mount, there are [clamps] that hold it down until the engines are at full power and working correctly.The [launch mount itself] is a massive steel plate ring, and sits on six legs two meters in diameter, filled with reinforced concrete.  In turn the legs are anchored to a two-meter thick concrete base, which is anchored to 100 foot pilings buried in the ground.  It's not going anywhere."
14-4,Seeing this while Artemis constantly fails to fire up its engines kinda makes me sad
14-4-1,A Raptor engine failed to fire on booster 7. There was an accidental explosion a few weeks ago. Things happen.
14-4-1-1,"The thing that I like about SpaceX's approach is that they're not afraid to launch, fail, and rapidly iterate. They embrace failure as part of the process. As a software engineer, the strategy resonates with me.SLS feels like classic waterfall development at its worst."
14-4-1-1-1,"They're hard to compare. NASA is under massive public scrutiny and must keep congress happy at all times. SpaceX can blow up a dozen Starships and shrug it off but if SLS explodes, it's could be the end of the Artemis program immediately because of the publicity that would come from it"
14-4-1-1-1-1,"As someone who works on the Artemis crew module, this is correct. Failure isn't really an option. Were currently building Artemis 2 and 3, and one huge catastrophe would be detrimental to the future of Artemis. (Well, obviously)"
14-4-1-1-1-1-2,Please quit and find a more useful job that isnt stealing tax dollars from all of us.
14-4-1-1-1-1-2-4,Telling someone in the space industry to find a more useful job  you’re hilarious they’re already working on the best pursuit humanity has.  They should resign and post tax spending grievances to Reddit.
14-4-1-1-1-3,I think most people critical of the SLS understands this more or less.Unfortunately explanations like this that highlight ways that NASA is incredibly hamstrung compared to private companies mostly just serve to highlight reasons why NASA shouldn't be in charge of this kind of project
14-4-1-1-1-3-1,"Personally I think NASA or ESA absolutely should be in charge. However, due to the aforementioned hamstring ing, they can't do the flashy stuff like SpaceX because a) waste of criminally limited funding and b) governmental interference. I'm not American but damn, it's sad to see how NASA has been damn near crippled."
14-4-1-1-1-3-1-1,"In terms of flexibility, NASA is probably in the best shape now that it's been in since the 70's. They've always been crippled by the whims of Congress. The commercial sector has completely revitalised what NASA can do and it's the reason space is becoming interesting again"
14-4-1-1-1-3-1-2,For me SpaceX is one of NASA project.SpaceX as we know it today would not exist without NASA. NASA tried to promote new space companies to emerge thanks to multiples commercial contracts and SpaceX directly beneficiate from them.
14-4-1-1-1-3-1-3,"NASA or ESA not doing the ""flashy stuff"" like SpaceX is doing has nothing to do with having criminally limited funding though. Like, SLS has cost over 20 *billion* dollars at this point while re-using a bunch of previously developed hardware."
14-4-1-1-1-3-1-4,"a) that's a fallacy, one of the point of failing fast is that it ends up saving money. That said, the public would not understand this when all they see are explosions and change of plans."
14-4-1-1-1-3-2,"NASA should be the program leaders, but private should be in charge of the process"
14-4-1-1-1-3-2-1,How is that any different than SLS? NASA is in charge of that but all the parts of the rocket are made by a ton of different companies
14-4-1-1-1-4,"SLS is at its heart a political program, but the calculus for what keeps it funded is complex. Congress will cancel SLS when it becomes politically useful for most of congress to do so.Remember that Challenger blew up, killed 7 astronauts, and it was very obvious negligence on the part of NASA management. There was no talk of cancelling it and really no repercussions for management who had made the decisions."
14-4-1-1-1-4-1,The Apollo 1 fire nearly ended the Apollo program. And the Challenger explosion did have an impact on the shuttle program
14-4-1-1-1-7,"~~Nobody seems to be acknowledging that congress mandated that SLS use the rs-25 which we just aren’t going to make any more of. If we lose one of those rockets then there won’t be a replacement.~~I was 100% wrong here. It’s very good that they have something lined up for replacing engines, but I do still think it would be better in the long run to develop a new system from scratch."
14-4-1-1-1-7-1,They have awarded a contract to produce new RS-25 engines.
14-4-1-1-2,"Well, the problem is that SLS isn’t - and never was - *just* an aerospace program. It’s also a jobs program.It was designed that way intentionally (as was the precursor Constellation project) to be politically un-killable due to creating so many jobs in so many different areas of the country. Constellation got killed anyways… but then it came back from the dead as SLS.So in a way, I’m somewhat impressed by how astute the NASA program managers were in structuring it that way. But I’m simultaneously appalled at the inefficiencies and technical issues that resulted from the strategy."
14-4-1-1-2-1,Unkillable but the rocket was pretty much obsolete when the program started. Whats the point of it being unkillable if the results mean nothing?
14-4-1-1-2-1-1,>	It’s also a jobs programCongresspersons get a lot of shit and have trouble getting re-elected when they put their constituents out of a job.
14-4-1-1-3,Part of the issue here is that most Americans don’t care if a billionaire blows up his investments trying new things. Losing a few billion of tax payer money hits different. That is my guess.
14-4-1-1-3-7,"We just need to televise the wastefulness of other government programs (the military, primarily) to help put it in perspective."
14-4-1-1-3-7-2,"I don't agree with this statement.The SpaceX to NASA comparison is effectively apples to apples. As a tax payer I can see that SpaceX is both quicker and cheaper. Of course if the military spends $600,000 on a Porto potty that would be wasteful spending, but as a general rule money spent on the military preparedness is not wasted. In an ideal scenario our well funded military can provide peace and stability just by existing, and without being used."
14-4-1-4,The ratio of desired outcomes to undesired outcomes is the difference.
14-4-1-4-1,"Starship has taken some serious bumps to get where it is. The changeover from carbon fiber to stainless steel was a huge change and that was years ago. Plus its development slowed significantly in the last year especially, although it looks like they are finally getting close to a launch. But nothing is for certain, Musk himself said that the landing system might not work, which would be a huge change for the system."
14-4-1-4-1-2,"Development hasn't slowed at all - it's just been less visible unless you are paying attention.  The progress they've made on both ship and booster has been astounding since the flight tests last year, but the most significant change has been the introduction of a new version of the engine, which is a *massive* improvement on the first iteration and the development of the ground systems (stage 0) - the launch mount, the tower, QD systems and chopsticks."
14-4-1-4-1-2-1,"Remember when a few month ago everyone wanted to send Musk to a mental asylum for wanting to catch the booster mid flight, now the hardware is in place and we are a mere few month away from it happening."
14-4-1-4-1-2-1-1,"In Musk months, that could be 4 years. I love the innovation, but never trust the timetables."
14-4-1-5,"True. Difference is that SLS has already been delayed by 6 years and is tens of billions over budget. Starship shouldn't had even had it's first hop before SLS flew, yet it is now possible that it will reach orbit first. Highly unlikely it will beat SLS/Artemis to the moon, since that is their first flight plan."
14-4-1-5-1,"> Highly unlikely it will beat SLS/Artemis to the moon, since that is their first flight plan.Actually, a version of Starship is what's actually going to the moon. SLS is only getting astronauts to lunar orbit."
14-4-1-5-1-1,"That is why I specifically said SLS/Artemis. Technically speaking, SLS will be launching the Orion capsule and the ICPS into orbit to head to the moon. Orion will go into a flyby of the moon on SLS's first launch, thereby beating Starship to the moon. The first Starship to a flyby of the moon won't be until sometime next at best."
14-4-1-6,"The explosion was technically a failure with the test, not the engines."
14-4-2,SpaceX is technically team Artemis too!
14-4-2-1,"I strongly suspect they have a ""SLS never works"" variant of the missions in parallel planning, though."
14-4-2-1-1,"Not really necessary, there are tons of workarounds and opportunities for flexibility in the existing architecture. Potentially they could launch crew with Dragon and use additional refueling flights with tankers either in LEO or in lunar orbit or both to be able to get to and from the lunar surface and back to Earth without using SLS or developing new hardware."
14-4-2-1-1-1,"You're describing ""SLS never works"" plans of the precise nature I'm referring to."
14-4-2-2,"Noooo!! Don't support Space X, reddit!!! Ebon Musck sux remember?!!! 1!1"
14-4-4,A lot of this SpaceX work is under nasa envelope
14-4-4-1,"Not starship, or commercial falcon 9 launches"
14-4-4-1-1,Nah you are wrong. Starship is under the HLS arm of Artemis/NASA. NASA has insight and oversight and we do a lot of analysis on it ourselves. We also have engineers who do analysis for CCP.
14-4-4-1-1-1,"Starship is not under NASA, only the HLS version is, which they are building/developing in parallel"
14-4-4-2,If not all. Technically NASA bailed out SpaceX from bankruptcy with a 1.5B contract years ago.
14-4-4-2-1,Winning a competitive contract to provide a service is not a bailout.
14-4-4-2-2,"Is it a ""bailout"" when you get a good return on your money? NASA got the first round of CRS flights from SpaceX at a lower cost than anyone else was offering to provide."
14-4-4-2-2-1,They also got the following rounds at a lower cost than anyone else was offering to provide. In fact I think I saw the recent number was 15 crew dragon flights for the cost of 5 boeing crewed flights at this point.
14-4-4-2-2-1-2,"Back when commercial crew was awarded, Boeing had a lot of credibility and SpaceX was the new kid on the block. NASA actually had to beg Boeing to do commercial crew, because Congress didn't trust SpaceX. Strange reversal of fortune now that we are several years down the road. SpaceX has a lot of credibility and crewed Dragon is taken for granted. Boeing is now the one struggling for credibility."
14-4-4-2-2-2,"The GM bailout was still a bailout, but I get what you're saying."
14-4-4-2-2-2-1,"GM didn't win any contracts, was given free money so people wouldn't get fired."
14-4-4-2-2-2-1-2,"Sure, all I was saying was that ROI is irrelevant"
14-4-4-2-2-3,NASA got a cheap deal with SpaceX because one of their JPL engineers is married to the president/COO of SpaceX.I love innovation and collaboration but I finally discovered the nepotism in these projects and that always dulls the excitement for me.
14-4-4-2-2-3-1,"I don't think the jpl engineers have much input on who nasa awards bids too, so I'm not sure what your point is."
14-4-5,Not me. Artemis is just government pork corruption. The cost of it per flight (assuming it ever flies) is insane. I don’t want my tax dollars going to something so crazy expensive just to stoke a congressperson’s ego.
14-4-5-2,"Where do the engineers come from? If NASA didn't have the SLS, there would'nt be and functional engineers for SpaceX OR and advice from NASA along the way...which was plentiful"
14-4-5-2-1,"While NASA obviously wrote the book on US spaceflight and SpaceX is standing on the shoulders of giants I don't think the SLS program is to thank for SpaceX engineers.The SLS program starts in 2011 but by that time SpaceX had already reached orbit with Falcon 1, Falcon 9 and Dragon."
14-4-5-2-1-1,I was wondering if someone was going to catch that
14-4-5-2-3,You do understand that there is engineering degrees in universities?
14-4-5-2-3-1,Thank you?
14-4-6,"Don’t forget: Artemis “failures” so far have ended with scrubbed launches due to problems they found. Starship failures have, largely, ended with a 10 story rocket slamming into the ground at a 100% loss - if not exploding before leaving the ground."
14-4-6-2,"Starship ""failures"" are happening a couple of years into development with early barebone prototypes that were designed for testing and data gathering and would have been dismantled in any event. SLS failures are happening after a dozen years of development with a finalized version of the SLS rocket."
14-4-6-2-1,Unfortunately for NASA the people that control their budget would probably freak out if they were blowing up rockets constantly as part of their testing.
14-4-6-2-2,"Starship will have complications down the stretch too, I guarantee it."
14-4-6-3,"So far SLS ""failures"" have resulted in 6 years delay and cost billions and billions of dollars.  Starship failures have have been minor in comparison."
14-4-6-3-1,Starship is also privately funded and NASA can’t afford to just blow up a program on the launch pad.
14-4-6-3-1-1,"We can see that the hardware-rich agile approach delivers better results with a fraction of the budget.  Maybe NASA would not be able to pull it off successfully perhaps sure to political constraints.  Even if they can't do it as well as SpaceX, it could still save them a lot of money."
14-5,pretty incredible that these machines are so robust. That's a lot of fuckn dirt and dust it's wild it doesn't affect anything
14-5-1,Later versions of this ship are supposed to sit around on the surface of Mars for two years before flying back to Earth - this is good practice for that.
14-6,What a wonderful relief to see people here embracing this! I am so used to coming to r/space to see SpaceX getting shit on.
14-6-1,"I second that emotion! A very nice surprise, because this is very solid progress toward something awesome for us all!"
14-7,Is there any estimated date when the orbital test flight will happen?
14-7-3,"People are hoping for early next year so everything is ready until 2024, but when Musk doesn't want to give a clear timeline apart from ""well, we have a planning window"", you know there still is plenty to figure out."
14-7-3-1,I suppose it's better then when musk was giving unrealistic time tables.
14-7-3-1-1,"I mean, he has a timeline that says ""somewhere between now and March"", to leave plenty room for getting mission-ready. It's just not a certainty."
14-8,What if starship ends up beating sls to orbit
14-8-1,"Nothing, it's still a win for mankind either way."
14-8-5,starship is going to launch by next weekend?
14-8-5-1,no chance but at the same time sls might not launch next weekend. if they can't fix it at the pad of could be a few weeks before SLS is ready. SLS could also fail to reach orbit which gives starship a lot of time
15,[OC] SpaceX launching record-breaking 13th time on the same booster
15-1,What is the expected lifeline for the booster? how many more launched can it pull?
15-1-1,"Goal was 10 with little refurbishment, and 100 in total"
15-1-1-1,What % of the total launch cost does that save?
15-1-1-1-2,"Since spacex is private, not public, those numbers are a little hard to come by. That being said, the difference between new and used for a customer is something like 25%, after propellant and profits."
15-1-1-1-2-1,> profitsRemember when it was a government operation?
15-1-1-1-2-1-1,"SpaceX launches cost ~$2700/kg for payload, NASA  and ESA cost >$10k/kg (the Ariane 6 will be $4-5k, so still >50% more than SpaceX).I think the private operation has served us well."
15-1-1-1-2-1-4,"Why yes, I do remember the $10,000 toilet covers."
15-1-1-1-2-1-4-1,Where they a work of creative fiction like the hammers?
15-1-1-1-2-1-6,30% profit or whatever is a much better deal than the typical 1000% NASA surcharge
15-1-1-1-2-1-6-1,"Hey, new technology can be cheaper;  neat-o.  Not the point."
15-1-1-1-2-1-8,Yes. And?
15-1-1-1-3,Cost to customer or cost to SpaceX?
15-1-2,Anything is just a guess. The way they'll find out how many launches they can manage is by doing. The most obvious major constraint is going to be soot buildup inside the plumbing of the engines. They can determine the rates of buildup from post flight inspections but it's hard to figure out exactly when it'll cause problems for the vehicle so estimates of longevity are just approximations. The airframe and other components are likely capable of lasting hundreds of flights.
15-1-2-2,"I'm sure frame stretch will become an issue at some point as well. Even if the skin doesn't (which it will), frame stretch can cause stability issues, as well as stress fracture propagation. The engineering issue isn't whether one can prevent that. It's for how long does one want to prevent that before costs get in the way."

15-4-1-1,"There was one on saturday, one on sunday and one earlier today (from different places)"
15-4-1-1-1,today is sunday?
15-4-1-2,"Yup, Friday!  There was a Saturday daytime launch in cali and then an overnight launch last night"
15-4-1-2-1,"Three.THREE launches in… 48 hours?Whatever you think of Elon Musk, you cannot deny he has achieved something considered impossible. Also something Boeing and other military defense contractors, cannot duplicate, in spite of their billions in funding."
15-4-1-2-1-1,That is utterly insane to launch three times in 48 hours. That is some elite level engineering
15-4-1-2-1-4,Elon and a good team of engineers. He's not designing these rockets by himself. He just helps to bring in the funds to do so.
15-4-1-2-1-4-1,"Ah if it were all about the funds why can’t nasa or any of the other big players do it. Because they are doing it just for the funds, and have mission-less companies. If it were all about the funds tesla would have died in 2008. Can throw money at the wall all day and it means nothing. It aint the money honey"
15-4-1-2-1-4-2,It’s not only about designing the rockets. Of course most of the work is accomplished by the brilliant engineers at SpaceX. But organizing the whole effort and leading and inspiring the team to push through challenges is Elon’s primary contribution and it’s why SpaceX is so successful.
15-4-1-2-1-5,"This isn't an MCU movie, Musk isn't doing all of this himself, or even any significant part of the engineering. He just takes credit for other people's work."
15-4-1-2-1-5-2,"True.But compare that to Boeing and Blue Origin. They have a lot of good engineers, but their leaders cannot take credit, because there isn't any achievement to take credit for...At least, Elon has pushed his engineers in the correct direction, and his engineers have produced enough achievements for Elon to pick and choose from...??"
15-5,"There has got to be some insane QA, and integrity checks before they..literally reuse a rocket lol like, that is such a crazy thing to think about.

15-6-2-2-1-1,"It's paywalled, but the important parts are the parts that are wrong. There was a mine, but it wasn't in South Africa, it was in Zambia which did not have apartheid. And his family was part of the anti-apartheid political party in South Africa. One of the reasons Elon left is because he didn't want to be forced to serve in the apartheid South African military (mandatory draft). And as to the mine, it was a small mine and his father had a small partial ownership of it. His main source of income was from being a successful engineer in South Africa.And finally, Elon didn't get any of that money (what little there is) other than 10% of a seed round for his first company from his father. (His parents didn't even pay for his college. He graduated with huge amounts of student debt.)> So weird being an Elon stanImagine being so hateful of someone that you believe any convenient facts that reinforce your bias."

16-5-2-1-1,"Look man, I fucking *despise* Musk... I'd happily see him shot into the sun...But SpaceX has pulled off enough 'practically impossible' engineering feats thus far that I'm not inclined to bet against them. Might I remind you that everyone thought reusable rockets was 'practically impossible' and we see how that worked out."
16-5-2-1-1-1,"No one thought it was practically impossible though, reusable rockets have been being worked on with varying degrees of success since the 1960s.When I say practically impossible, I mean things like creating a self-sustaining colony on Mars, or having a 100 person crew on starship, or launching 42,000 satellites every 5 years for starlink."
16-5-2-1-2,That might be true but the comment is and this story is with regards of SpaceX Starship. still a stupid project?
16-5-2-1-2-1,"Yes! It's very stupid. Look at the launch, Elon obviously has a hand in things despite every muskie saying he's removed, and it's all on the ""engineers."" They cut corners with a simple trench/deluge system (for the largest rocket to date...), which ultimately made their rocket fail. What other corners did they cut? All of them.It's a band of idiots making something stupid."
16-5-2-1-3,"How would you feel about spacex if Elon musk magically disappeared tomorrow?Same company, same machines, same designs, same equipment, no Elon?"
16-5-2-1-3-2,"Nothing, same as any other private rocket company. I feel bad for the talented people who work there and have to listen to Musk's insane claims and promises though."
16-5-2-1-3-3,">How would you feel about spacex if Elon musk magically disappeared tomorrow?>Same company, same machines, same designs, same equipment, no Elon?You would have Blue Origin. Not a particular bright outlook."
16-5-2-1-3-3-1,"Well, one is quite successful and the other is really not, is the thing."
16-5-2-3,"Who gives a shit? People act like this stuff is going to impact their lifes, it won't. Maybe we should focus on the stuff happening on earth and how we battle things like climate change instead of trying to go to the fucking moon, mars or trying to launch a shitty satellite internet network which operates on the mercy of an egomaniac billionaire."
16-5-2-3-1,"This can effect climate change, it can better satellites into space, faster internet, faster tech. Mars is good for a plan b in the future.If you want to go back to the horse and buggy…go ahead."
16-5-2-3-1-1,Dream on.
16-5-2-3-1-1-1,"the options are horse and buggy, or live on Mars. I don't make the rules"
16-5-2-3-2,"Also to add that one rocket launch is a GIANT source of pollution. A single Falcon 9 launch releases ""about 116 tons of CO2 in 165 seconds"" A US citizen releases about 14-15 tons every **year**."
16-5-2-3-2-1,Here is a video explaining the pollution of rockets is minimal and getting better.
16-5-2-3-2-1-1,"""minimal"" won't matter if space travel becomes a commodity. Commercial industries go parabolic and space travel moving private gives me zero warm and fuzzies that it won't become a pollution source that eclipses the aircraft industry. Sure the aircraft industry is ""dirty"" but it can shove 800-1000 people around the world for the same ecological damage that a rocket could likely move 10-20 people safely. If somehow all of the fuel was gathered in a green way it would still be a bad use of energy. I'm just scared of the extreme waste that this industry will possibly cause because of tourism and other unnecessary launches."
16-5-2-3-2-2,"That seems like a lot, but [here's a source]"
16-5-2-3-3,"So when we have a next extinction, we have had before. We need a plan B. Mars is a plan B if not humans won’t survive. It’s not easy. But your way of thinking is saying to Columbus to stay put in Europe…there is no advantage of sailing to another place."
16-5-2-3-3-1,">Mars is a plan BThe requirements to establish human settlement on Mars are still far out of reach. The advances necessary to ""fix"" Mars would just be massively more useful on Earth. There is no plan B. Earth is plans A thru Z."
16-5-2-3-3-1-1,"They are not out of reach, but it will take lots of time, and travel. Might not be this generation.It’s like telling Columbus that going to the new world is impossible.I don’t see why we can’t fix this planet and the next one? That’s a very limited view."
16-6,What? You mean a giant explosion in midair didn’t remain contained to a few feet?Astonishing!
16-6-1,"The headline is misleading. The explosion is far less worrying than the botched launch:> Now, residents and researchers are scrambling to assess the impact of the explosion on local communities, their health, habitat and wildlife including endangered species. Of primary concern is the large amount of sand- and ash-like particulate matter and heavier debris kicked up by the launch. The particulate emissions spread far beyond the expected debris field.Should be noted that Musk knew very well how bad the launch was going to be but decided that constructing dampeners/etc would take too long."
16-6-1-1,"""How bad""?  Because the concrete was damaged, the entire effort is ""bad""?  The launch pad and tower is primarily intact.  Considering the number of exploding rockets the world has seen during development, this seems rather benign. Yes, debris rained down over a large area.  Pretty much an expected result.  Progress requires failures."
16-6-1-1-1,"Progress does not require an easily foreseen, intentionally worsened failure in the middle of an ecological conservation zone. SpaceX should not have had this launch without flame trenches/water dampeners/etc."
16-6-1-1-1-1,"Ecological zone?  It's rather benign debris that rained down sand, rock and concrete.  Not toxic anything."
16-6-1-1-1-1-2,"Go ahead and breath in aerosolized concrete for a while, tell me how silicosis feels."
16-6-1-1-2,Not sure what pictures you have been looking at but the launch pad is not mostly in tact it's fucking gone. There is no pad left it's a crater. Sure the tower is still there big deal.Sure looks intact right?
16-6-1-1-2-1,"Actually not so bad. You are looking at the launch mount and its base.  So much easier to repair than the other 90% of the complex. The tower, tank farm, etc are far more complex.Deluge system coming I would think."
16-6-1-1-2-1-1,It is bad lol. The launch pad is a 20+ foot deep crater which should never have happened. The tower is not that complex. The tanks nearly went they were hit by debris it was just pure luck that the LOX etc didn't go kaboom and take out most of the site.Deluge system HAS to come otherwise they won't be launching there again. They may not even get permission to launch from teh FAA without it. There is a good chance that the mission failure was due to damage die to not having it.
17,[@elonmusk] Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.
17-1,I'm impressed by the new dashboard that includes which engines are still working and orientation and fuel gauges.
17-1-1,I was surprised by how upfront they were with engines failing.  Just because they’re expecting it doesn’t mean they’re going to show it off!
17-1-1-1,Someone pointed that it may have been to show which engines were on during the boostback/re-entry/landing burns
17-1-1-1-1,"Yeah this makes sense. But it's pretty cool that it actually showed them failing live, vs just showing the ""intended"" engine state."
17-1-1-2,"The main reason for going many vs big is to allow for failures. Falcon 9 will continue on single engine failure, it just burns longer."
17-1-1-2-1,"It also helps that as a reusable booster, there is extra propellant on board. They can dip into that propellant. If they get a RUD on landing, oh well."
17-1-1-2-2,Interesting. Has that ever happened?
17-1-1-2-2-1,Falcon 9 flight 4 and 108 both lost an engine during stage 1 flight and still completed the primary mission.
17-1-1-2-2-1-1,"Flight 83 also (root cause cleaning fluid in the engine, made it go bang on ascent, failed to land)"
17-1-1-2-2-1-1-1,"Good catch! So after 222 Falcon 9 and 5 Falcon Heavy flights with 3 engine failures that makes 2,113 engine flights with 99.86% reliability, quite a feat!"
17-1-2,Yeah the UI was cool. I'm not sure how accurately the orientation was reporting. Starship was much more active in reality.
17-1-3,"I’m also impressed how the dashboard somewhat correctly showed the entire stack flipping. That’s not something it should ever show, I think, so I wouldn’t expect them to test it. It’s kind of cool that the UI didn’t just crash, but managed to show it."
17-1-3-1,"Good QA tests the expected scenarios.  Great QA tests all of the scenarios.  If I was a SpaceX UI QA engineer, an upside down stack on an early test flight doesn't seem that far out of the realm of possibility."
17-1-4,"Except that dashboard was incorrect. It was still showing 3 engines out long past when a 4th and then a 5th failed, then it was showing 5 failed, when 6 were clearly failed in the camera shots. But ya at least they had the guts to plainly show they had failed engines even if it was inaccurate.Tho i was surprised at how much the commentators ignored before letting on there was a problem. They gave a call out for nominal thrust, when 6 engines were failed. And then John Insprucker saying that it was flipping in preparation of separation....surprised he made that mistake, he certainly knows better. It was clearly out of control at that point, and they carried on like it was nominal. That is normal at most space companies, but spacex usually doesn't do this, they normally call out the off nominal stuff quite quickly."
17-1-4-2,"You gotta think tho, the SpaceX stream is just a really big commercial. Obviously the presenters (spokespeople) are going to do their best to spin something bad the best that they can, it’s just business."
17-1-4-2-1,"I know, but they are usually on top of calling out anomalies, especially john, hes called out the off nominal things many times in the past.I'm guessing they just got caught up in the moment."
17-1-6,"I really want it for Falcon launches, it would add to the immersion seeing the fuel and which engines are being used."
17-2,"To be honest the most impressive part of the launch for me was seeing the stack hold up as it was spinning. The structure team definitely deserves a pat on the back for making such a sturdy vehicle! Impressive work all around, here's to going farther on the next attempt!"
17-2-1,"Yeah i agree, when it was doing the spins i was thinking it would be breaking up at any moment."
17-2-1-1,"SpaceX just launched a rocket taller than the tallest building in 21 states, territories or districts…. Into a triple cartwheel before purposeful RUD. Incredible."
17-2-1-1-1,With a successful test of the FTS!
17-2-1-1-2,"It's larger than the largest rocket ever built until now, the Saturn V.  The scale is difficult to wrap your head around."
17-2-1-1-5,Purposeful may be a stretch lol
17-2-1-1-5-1,"So you think they didn't say ""oh wow its in an uncontrolled spin, guess its time to pull the plug""?No way they risk an uncontrolled spinning rocket falling back to earth - seems pretty clear they hit the big red button."
17-2-1-1-5-1-4,What does the big red button do? Do they rig the ship with explosives to break it up?
17-2-1-1-5-2,"Technically the first cartwheel would have been purposeful, because (and I learned this today) flipping the rocket to fling the 2nd stage off by centrifugal force is how they do stage separation with this thing - it must have worked fine in Kerbal Space Program."
17-2-1-1-5-2-1,That’s thinking outside the box lol
17-2-2,"importantly as quoted from one news article is:>SpaceX has a history of learning from mistakes. The company’s mantra is essentially, “Fail fast, but learn faster.”they will eventually get there."
17-2-2-1,One of the first mantras you are taught in entrepreneurship is to “fail smart” meaning your failing but in the right direction and learning from each mistake along the way.
17-2-2-1-1,agree; especially potent when dealing with an engineering issue where things can be recursively get better. Some other displines are harder though admittingly but not impossible.
17-2-2-1-2,"If this failed by hitting itself with concrete blocks, that doesn’t seem too smart"
17-2-2-1-2-1,If that’s what actually happened I would laugh….  But the fact that it even got off the ground and handled a gimble locked free roll plus almost a full 180 inversion against its launch parameters without breaking in half is really impressive. This will most likely be the vessel that takes us to space in a real way..   the space station will be decommissioning soon….   We need to be able to launch large payloads asap.
17-2-3,Completely ! I was thinking it would break at every moment so it is structurally solid in spin over 1k kmph. I wonder why it didn’t separated since the latch mechanism is pretty light… maybe the g’s crushed some metal preventing from that or a malfunction. Anyway that was the biggest wobbly machine up in the air since humans are alive (unless Graham Hankoch churn a new theory)
17-2-3-6,"Someone should check my math but I estimate an end-cap g-load of about .75 gravity on the first spin, increasing to just over 1g on the final spin (about 4rpm and 60m radius).  That's a lot of pull on the center section, I'm not going to do the calculus to get actual force but let's say a lot, with the upper and lower section opposing.  I don't know how the sep works but it's possible it was too many gs pulling apart that stuck them together."
17-2-4,Also impressive how many engine could fail and still ALMOST work.
17-2-4-1,"Even more impressive - Elon said that an engine out is like a grenade going off, and wondered if the vehicle could survive it. Turns out it can. Tested and proved MULTIPLE times. Tick.ISTR a comparison (by Jon Goff, I think) of the RS-25 as about the same as a 13GW thermal nuclear facility (8x 1GW electrical-output reactors combined).Raptor is within 1-2% of RS-25 thrust. So it's not hard to see how ~13GW failing would be a huge explosion.If I have remembered that correctly - 33x engines at 100% would be 0.4 tera-watts."
17-2-4-2,It would probably not have achieved orbit with 5 engines out.
17-2-5,"Nah, that just means it's over-built! Time to make it thinner and lighter for better performance."
17-2-5-1,"Overbuilt for one phase can be just-right-built for a different phase. It does need to flip, after all, and do other things."
17-2-5-1-1,"Sure, but the coupling should only ever need to deal with compression, and it very successfully resisted a bunch of shear and bending moments during the spinning.That said, reusability calls for more sturdiness, so perhaps that doesn't indicate it being overbuilt, but I'd be inclined to say they could likely shave a good amount of weight off of the coupling hardware.Just another one of the hundreds of subsystems for them to iterate on, and likely a pretty low priority one."
17-2-5-1-1-3,"For the purposes of testing, a bit of overbuild is A-OK."
17-2-5-1-1-5,Slightly overbuild the first ones. Then trim as you learn.
17-2-5-6,Yeah but you have all that grabby arm stuff
17-2-5-7,Might be overbuilt for one launch. But just right to be able to launch hundreds of times with some tolerance for the metal fatigue that will occur over time.
17-2-5-8,"I think better to phrase it that it is built right for this phase of the test / development programme. Today, that extra strength extended the time of the test. They may have tested regimes they didn't expect to, or just had time to download more telemetry. One of the great aspects of recovering the hardware is that it makes it much easier to see the points that need to stay strong, and where it's over-strong."
17-2-7,"Remember Firefly's first launch? That rocket was also super sturdy and survived some pretty impressive spinning! Starship took it to a whole new level, of course."
17-2-8,"At 40 km up the air is pretty thin, forces were way lower than max Q"
17-3,It took Falcon 1 three (3) separate failed attempts (taking Space X to the edge of bankruptcy) before it reached orbit. This is a much bigger & more complex launch vehicle -- and ~~leaving~~  getting to earth orbit is HARD.Good luck to Space X team on the next launch.... This is how science + engineering progresses.
17-3-1,It also took Starship 3 tries to (technically) stick the landing!
17-3-1-1,I'll be happy with success on the third try for Starship!
17-3-1-2,"5 tries. SN 8, 9, 10, and 11 all blew up. Then SN15 landed in one piece.But your point stands."
17-3-1-2-1,Didn't 10 bounce and land for like a minute then blow up? I know one of them landed then blew up
17-3-1-2-1-1,"Yeah, it landed hard, then there was a fire underneath the skirt that went on for a few minutes, then it blew up."
17-3-2,"Agreed. Having a launch go perfectly on the first flight should be the exception, not the rule. This is doubly true on a vehicle as ambitious as Starship. SpaceX will do what SpaceX does best, learn from ""failures""  and go farther next time!"
17-3-2-1,But this was not a failure. They hit their intended goal.
17-3-2-1-1,"Maybe the bare minimum goal, but actual separation and testing of the second stage was also a goal."
17-3-2-1-1-1,Bare minimum was clearing the pad. They did that. Survived multiple engine failures that were big enough to see from the ground. Survived maxq. Then continued to stage separation with multiple engines out.
17-3-2-1-1-1-1,It survived a MaxQ certainly (since any launch will have one) but it can’t be said to have survived the actual MaxQ given it wasn’t going fast enough due to the many engine outs.
17-3-2-1-1-1-1-1,They throttle down anyways. I think it was valid.
17-3-2-1-1-1-1-2,"Falcon 9 throttles up to compensate for engine failure, I would imagine Starship does too. They also throttle down before maxQ."
17-3-2-1-1-2,"The complete flight with re-entry and water landing was an aspirational goal, but not an expected result as stated by musk. The odds of success were low and accepted as such - they just wanted to collect whatever data they could with what they had built so that they could move on to their already much improved design.The alternative would be to throw this one away and move on to the next. Far better to just see how far it would have gotten despite known shortcomings and collect the data so many others would love to have."
17-3-2-1-3,It didn’t destroy the pad for one thing so that’s fantastic
17-3-2-1-3-1,It kind of did... have you seen the crater?
17-3-2-1-3-1-2,There’s pictures of the aftermath?
17-3-2-2,"Such an odd comment.For any other company, a launch failure like this would be the end. It's ok to accept that this is behavior that SpaceX should not continue to repeat."
17-3-2-2-1,"What? Every commercial launch provider I know of has failures like this frequently. So did NASA in the 60s and 70s when they prioritized speed in development. Rocketry is *hard*, and so is revolutionizing the design"
17-3-2-2-2,I really don’t think you know what you are talking about. They need data to learn. These things are super hard problems to solve. You can’t model them on a computer so you have to do it for real. SpaceX have always done their testing publicly. They use iterative design based on test flight data. That is going to help them make progress quickly. Falcon 9 did not get to be so reliable just by chance.
17-3-2-2-2-1,You can certainly model it on a computer and space X does a ton of modeling. The problem is that too much modeling leads to failures like Boeings Starliner. Space X has an amazing balance of real world testing and simulation.
17-3-2-2-3,Spacex has always and likely will always engineer this way. Its motto is to fail fast learn faster. You can usually skip a decade or two of paper rocket building by doing it this way.
17-3-2-2-6,"It’s like comparing apples to oranges, SpaceX’s design strategy is all about rapid testing and iteration. Most/all other rocket companies do not develop in this fashion and so testing to destruction is not accounted for in their budgets. All of SpaceX’s starship prototypes are expendable and destruction is expected this early on."
17-3-3,The Wright Brother's first test flight of the day at Kitty Hawk also face planted.
17-3-3-1,Yes -- although Startship cleared the launchpad.  We are all curious to find out what went wrong.
17-3-3-1-1,The front didn't fall off
17-3-3-1-1-2,Should have made it from cardboard or cardboard derivatives.
17-3-5,"True, but they also have a lot more experience now."
17-3-5-1,"But also, the rocket is much, much bigger and more complex. So it evens out."
17-4,"First flight test of raptor 2 I believe, which is not nothing."
17-4-1,I’m a bit concerned about all those raptor engines blowing up as it ascended. All 33 engines working together is a whole different game to just testing a few at the time. Hopefully they don’t need to do fundamental changes to them. That would set them back massively.
17-4-1-1,"Who knows, could be shrapnel from the launch base."
17-4-1-2,"I think a lot of issues are caused by the complete destruction of the base of the launch pad. Stage 0 was really given a test today and while it survived it needs a lot of work. SpaceX needs a flame trench it needs to water cool everything in path of the flames, it needs a deluge system. It needs better protection for their tank farm and other equipment.Whatever models they used to assume they didn't need those changes here is clearly flawed. But now they know that so I expect they will now drop whatever assumptiona they made based on that model.They do all of that and I think all the raptors will make it fine. This was also the first flight of raptor 2 design, so that may have also played a role here.It's a lot of work to do but they should have enough data to know what to fix and how to fix it. I think the next test flight will be dramatically improved."
17-4-1-2-1,"Yeah I always thought they under engineered the base of the pad. You can just compare with the pad of N1 for example, I don’t know why they didn’t build something like that from the beginning. Anyways big learnings from this test and plus the deluge system they should work it out."
17-4-1-3,I think only 3 raptors didn't fire at first which may be linked to pad damage. The massive amount of real flight data they acquired today will certainly help them make a better version of those engines.
17-4-1-4,"Based on video, it seemed like the pad got torn up and took out a bunch of them with shrapnel"
17-5,They didnt blow up the pad and they confirmed that Superheavy flies and is a viable vehicle.Anything after that is just extra.
17-5-1,We now know starships are capable of somersaults. That thing must be sturdy AF.
17-5-1-1,The Kerbal approach of flying. Achievement Unlocked!Honestly never thought such things could occur realistically.
17-5-1-1-1,"Honestly it makes me want to take up amateur rocketry, this shit is dope."
17-5-1-1-1-1,"But why did the flight termination system activate so late, after so many flips? Are there flights parameters it follows?"
17-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Collecting data i'd figure. If it's within the calculated risk, why not let it fly a little longer before blowing it up!"
17-5-1-1-1-1-2,"(disclaimer) I'm not a rocket scientist nor am I your rocket scientist.At that point it was more than 30km high, it had time to correct itself and was a long long way from being a danger to anyone, so I assume they tried to get as much data as possible from it and possible induced the somersault to test the strength and stress capabilities to their max before boom."
17-5-1-1-1-1-7,Maybe the booster thought it was flying a nominal boostback profile (nevermind with engines out and the ship still attached)?
17-5-1-1-1-1-8,"I'm pretty sure there was a conversation in the control room to the extent of ""it's over open water, let it flip a few more times"""
17-5-1-1-2,Elon is the only guy rich enough to play Kerbal Space Program in real life.
17-5-1-1-2-1,"Worth it, especially all the benefits that could be gained through this decade if the program continues."
17-5-1-6,r/sturdyasfuck
17-5-2,So this is now the most powerful rocket in history that has flown yes?
17-5-2-1,Yes. By a wide margin.
17-5-3,"They might find issues with the OLM & tower, exiting with upcoming checks."
17-5-3-1,"Considering concrete knocked out some cars and cameras, I’m gonna say they destroyed the pad until proven otherwise lol"
17-5-3-1-1,Well
17-5-3-2,Right but the structure of the pad Is there. If it blew up the pad we’re being delayed for 6 months - a year.
17-5-3-2-1,"The physical structure of the OLM is there, but the literal ground underneath it is gone. There is a pretty decent chance the OLM is now structurally unsound."
17-5-3-2-1-1,"Even the best case of an intact launch mount. They still had to dig up the concrete down there to install the flame diverter and water suppression system. As well as remove and replace the 20 quick disconnects for the outer ring of engines(new engines incompatible with old qds). So no matter what they had a lot of work to do.Hopefully its structurally sound. But if it is not, the launch table looks intact. If the legs are no longer structurally sound, then hopefully its just a matter of cutting off the table, replacing the legs, and reinstalling the table(hopefully the table is not too heavy at this point, since a lot more work went in after it was lifted up the first time). The table, tower, arms, qds, fuel farm, etc are all the important bits. The legs are just concrete filled steel tubes."
17-5-4,> They didnt blow up the pad[The pad is blown].
17-5-4-3,"And that’s why Microsoft NBC is calling this launch and Elon Musk a complete and utter failure. This was a huge taxpayer scam by him, and they are calling him out for it."
17-5-4-3-1,SpaceX has saved the government billions of dollars in launch fees and made it possible to stop using Soviet rockets and engines. [This is a log scale launch cost graph].
17-5-6,Can we get a picture of that concrete?
17-6,"It never works the first time, this is part of the development"
17-6-1,Saturn V worked on its first try...As did SLS...
17-6-1-2,Saturn V took 6 years of on the ground dev work and it was an iteration of the Jupiter series designed in the mid 50s which was part of the redstone family from the early 50s. SLS took over a decade and its just a rehash of shuttle era parts. Spacex not only is flying the most advanced rocket engine ever created which is a clean sheet design. But also building a clean sheet novel rocket platform to attach it to using novel materials and novel assembly techniques.... outdoors. And plans for it to be reusable. All in a fraction of the time.So have a little respect.
17-6-1-3,Significantly less complex. These aren't SRBs.
17-6-1-4,StarShip can't be compared to any conventional launch vehicle and spacecraft.
17-6-1-5,"And from spaceX, Falcon 9 too, iirc"
17-7,Crazy we don't have more funding going in to Space exploration.  I can't help but think we'd be more technologically advanced in general if our nation's budget allocated more support for these kinds of projects.
17-7-1,"It's not just pure funding though but also how it is used. Blue Origin theoretically has access to massive financial capital but doesn't really do that much. SpaceX's main advantage is that they are willing to take risks and push boundaries very hard in a way that, say, Ariane is not and that isn't just a question of money.Back in the Falcon 1 days they almost went bust and Ratsat was the last launch they could afford."
17-7-3,We spend around 5X more on cosmetics as a species then we do space travel and exploration. Let that sink in just a minute.
17-7-3-2,Global cosmetics revenue: $103.4 billion Government expenditure on space programs: $103 billion 
17-7-3-2-1,"> Excluded are products applied to the skin for cleansing and care.That seems like a rather large segment to exclude.Still, interesting."
17-7-3-2-1-2,"Lol. I spent $5 this month on alcohol (excluding liquor, beer and wine)."
17-7-4,Why? What's the point? Why not use that money to try to improve lives on the planet they grow on?
17-7-4-1,"How do you know that won't improve lives?  What if we find cheaper, more efficient alternatives to oil or other resources needed to manufacture cheaper, safer medicines, etc?"
17-7-4-1-1,We already have those things. Rocket ships won't change our inability/unwillingness to implement them.
17-7-4-1-1-1,"So you can honestly tell me with 100 percent confidence that there is no other resource in the entire solar system that can improve our way of life?>inability/unwillingness to implement them.And based off whos opinion?  How do you know that it hasn't been determined by professionals in their fields, that the ""things we already have"", aren't cost effective or sustainable for the long term, hence the "" inability/unwillingness to implement them""?  Also, it's 100 percent possible to advance science and well-being  here on earth while funding projects like this to invest in our future.  But we are hindering ourselves by limiting our resources to a single planet/atmosphere/biome in which many of the resources here are tapped out/scarce/ or simply just too time-costing to be efficient."
17-7-4-1-1-1-1,"There are renewable/cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels already and the health care and pharmaceutical industries gouge the shit out of people for drugs (like insulin) just because they can. Improving our quality of life is possible without going on a scavenger hunt in space. If resources were found through these incredibly expensive trips to space, whoever found them would make sure they got as much as possible for them. That attitude like ""we've used up all the resources on earth, so we should start on other planets now"" is central to humanity's destructive behavior. Nonrenewable resources aren't necessary to sustain human life."
17-8,"As soon as it cleared the tower, it was a success."
17-8-1,"Honestly, I'm surprised so few engines failed, and it still flew pretty well without them.Bit of a slow start and a sideslip at first, but it managed to keep itself pointed all the way until minute three or so, where the lack of speed seemed to make it horizontally sideslide a bit.I wonder if there was failed seperation, or if the demolition-team decided it was safer not to decouple given the situation."
17-8-1-1,"Man those things were literally exploding, taking out adjacent engines. Really surprised it only had 5-6 out. You can see the engines exploding at 20ish seconds"
17-8-1-1-1,"Yeah. The announcers were like ""everything looking good"" and I'm here thinking ""this sucker is DONE. Couldn't believe it made it through max Q after those explosions. Honestly super impressive"
17-8-1-2,"Are we sure the sideslip wasn’t intentional? Rockets will sometimes do a small pitch over right at liftoff so that if it fails immediately, it doesn’t come crashing back directly onto the pad"
17-8-1-2-1,"I'm unsure tbh, all I can do is compare it to the Saturn really, and that certainly is a guesstimation."
17-8-1-2-1-1,You can’t really compare it to the Saturn V. The Saturn V had a TWR at liftoff of nearly 1. They didn’t have any thrust to spare
17-8-1-2-1-1-1,I was genuenly worried Starship wouldn't lift off at all at first tbh. I think the blown out engines meant they needed to burn off a few seconds of fuel before making 1 perhaps.
17-8-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Nah, the Super Heavy’s TWR is ~1.6. It could lose 11 engines and still be above 1.0"
17-8-1-3,Definitely failed separation.
17-8-1-3-1,"Not necessarily. I've read a pretty good theory about the ship not reaching the altitude that separation was supposed to occur (something like 35km vs the 80km expected) and the theory was that at that altitude, the atmospheric pressure on the front of the ship might have prevented the separation mechanisms from working.Ultimately, we'll have to wait for more information before we can really say anything definitive."
17-8-1-3-1-1,I'm confident that it was programed to not initiate separation if the vehicle was off course.
17-8-1-3-1-1-3,"but what about ""on course but behind elevation?""\- Fly for 5 minutes\- Timer on separation kicks in at 5 minutes (regardless of what altitude we're at)Except it was short of altitude so the atmosphere gummed things up."
17-8-2,It blew up
17-8-2-1,They intentionally blew it up though
17-8-2-1-1,Why?
17-8-2-1-1-1,"It was out of control and maybe a potential danger around the exclusion zone in the sea. They left it tumble for a bit to gather as much data as they could  before detonate some dedicated charges it had, for security purposes."
17-8-3,"By your metric, space shuttle Columbia was just peachy"
17-8-3-1,Columbia wasn’t the very first unmanned test flight of an unproven and massively complex rocket made by a private company with little incentive to make every launch perfect so they’ll get more money from congress for doing unappreciated work that benefits all of humankind
17-8-3-6,"The goal of this mission was to get data. Both stages were always going to end up exploded even under the best scenario and there was no payload to be lost or destroyed. They got tons of data and that was the mission, ergo mission success.Columbia had the goal of bringing human beings safely to and from space. It tragically did not achieve its mission. These two things are not the same"
17-8-4,"I noticed quite a lean almost immediately … was that intentional, or an error of some type?"
18,SpaceX launches and lands 3 rockets in 36 hours.
18-1,This is such an incredible accomplishment it's gotten to the point where rocket launches are not even newsworthy any more thanks to the progress SpaceX is making. It used to be when I was younger tourists would flock to where rockets were launching. The rate that changed was very fast and now the question is when will we establish the moon or Mars as a place some people live In a base on.Love to see positive non-tabloidy links on R/technology keep it up!
18-1-1,"Exactly. I am only looking forward to Moon landing and Mars launch now. Space commercialization is now normalized.EDIT: For the less perceptive of you, by Mars launch I meant HUMANS or at least a dry run of the same as a round trip without HUMANS"
18-1-1-1,mars launch? We have robot in mars already 2 in fact maybe more in dont know.
18-1-1-1-1,Humans mate! HUMANS
18-1-1-1-1-1,"That wont happen soon, mars is a hellscape and too far away."
18-1-1-1-1-1-1,"That all depends on starship. If starship flies as efficiently and dependably as falcon9, then a manned round trip mission to Mars is definitely doable."
18-1-2,"Tons of startups are following in their footsteps. I bet launches will become more regular and frequent so as to fill every window of opportunity. It’s not like airplanes since you can only launch during certain time frames, but I imagine every slot will be filled."
18-1-2-1,i hope we move to more  liquid oxygen and methane run rockets.
18-1-3,Just wondering about the impacts on the atmosphere of dramatically increased rocket launches….  Don’t disagree it is an amazing milestone for Space X.  Make me even sicker over the wasteful spending around other space systems.
18-1-3-2,"Hydrogen burns clean and got us to the moon the first time.  It's just more challenging to work with compared to kerosene or methane,  which is what Musk's rockets burn."
18-1-3-2-2,"Hydrogen is also made from natural gas, is an extreme greenhouse gas and leaks out everywhere. If you're going to say you can make the Hydrogen through electrolysis, well, you can do that and make Methane with it and CO2 as well. It costs more but it is the identical argument. Hydrogen is no cleaner than Methane. The greater fuel density of Methane makes for higher thrust and smaller lighter tanks, O2 and Methane are liquids at similar temperatures which simplifies and lightens tankage with common dome tanks instead of full dual tanks. Methane doesn't need solid rocket booster help to get off the ground. A common fuel for all stages simplifies ground support operations. The massive Saturn V did use Hydrogen for stages 2 and 3 but the beast of a stage 1 was Kerosene like Falcon. That was the bulk of the fuel, not Hydrogen."
18-1-3-2-2-1,I mean Methane is an extreme greenhouse gas too. [Like 20 times worse than CO2]
18-1-3-2-2-1-1,"Rocket engines burn a range of 70-99% of their fuel, in the case of the raptor engine, ~99.9% of the fuel is combusted, leaving co2, h2o and trace amounts of ch4There’s a reason they are labeled the most efficient types of engines."
18-1-3-3,"Rockets give off a ton of pollution, but they’re only single things. Even having 1 go off every hour wouldn’t come close to the sheer scale of how many cars, trucks, boats, planes, industry, etc… we have going and will never be a major contributor."
18-1-3-3-1,Wrong.  Pollution that occurs at higher altitudes is orders of magnitude worse!
18-1-3-4,"I suggest you read the whole article as it talks about the affects of rocket pollution but also the percentage of emissions from a global perspective, which is not that much compared to the rest of the emissive  industries."
18-1-4,"Musk has his flaws, but the accomplishments of SpaceX and Tesla are pretty impressive."
18-1-5,Wouldn’t be surprised to see the mega-rich set up a moon base so they can live in peace from us common rabble
18-1-5-1,"That would be very surprising to see. It would presumably have to be very comfortable and safe before they would want to move there. And if it's not safe for them on earth, it's hard to see why the moon would be safe. There would still be working class people on the moon, after all. You can get a pretty well secured mansion on earth for a lot less money. On earth the sun will rise every day, and you will have normal gravity so you won't have to worry about bone loss. And there is an atmosphere to protect you from cosmic radiation. On the moon, you would have to live in a bunker and limit your time outside (if you would even want to go outside). At that point, why not just live in a secure bunker underground on earth?I would expect to see something more like a summer camp for rich people so they can say they've been to the moon."
18-1-5-1-1,I’m just assuming within a century that it will be safe and that a place like the moon will be away from the dregs of crippling climate change as well as an elitist way to live apart from the the commoners like you and me.
18-2,I can’t believe this didn’t become a thread about hating Elon.
18-2-1,That's because it doesn't have his name needlessly in the title.
18-2-1-1,Which means it didn't trigger the anti-Elon bots
18-2-1-1-1,Alternate title for the fanboys:> *Elon* launches and lands his *Elon* rockets that *Elon* invented with his *Elon* brain.
18-2-4,Elon is the best human alive.
18-2-5,This is about the accomplishments of the people who actually do the work at SpaceX. He doesn't need to be part of this conversation.
18-2-5-1,He created SpaceX.
18-3,Amazing. They’ve come a long way since the early days when they had some explosions and malfunctions. This makes me wonder what NASA has been doing.
18-3-3,"Musk has admitted without NASA, SpaceX wouldn’t exist.   [  ["
18-3-3-2,Musk admits that without customers his business would have gone out of business.Imagine that: needing paying customers
18-3-4,"Contracting out to SpaceX through ""public private partnerships"", which are a feature of modern neoliberal policy designed explicitly to funnel public funds into private businesses without it technically being corruption."
18-3-4-1,"ah so it wasnt corruption when they funded inefficeint companies like boeing, lockheed who are 10 times costlier than spacex and never deliver quality products on time for the last 60 years.   stop using buzzwords and use more logic.   congress gives nasa money to get its mission done. its called distribution of annual budget of usa. they are not channeling public funds by some illegal method. its nasa job to choose the best company. thats how nasa has been operating for ever.   it was just different set of companies before spacex.    spacex has proven to get the job done."
18-3-4-1-2,"Hey man, not sure if you know this, but those were also the same thing I mentioned here. You don't need to stan SpaceX; it's just another contractor suckling the public teat. Just like Boeing.Just because a word has more than three syllables doesn't mean it's a buzzword, by the way."
18-3-4-1-2-1,"Hey man, you don't need to hate on every corporation because you are an underwhelming unaccomplished person. Go suck on Hasan's teat so he can afford another mansion."
18-3-4-1-2-1-1,"Can't address what I have to say either, huh? They're valid criticisms, but you're only able to.. what, shit on the fact I disagree with you?"
18-3-4-1-2-1-1-1,"Hasan is waiting for your working class donation, go on."
18-3-4-1-2-1-1-2,They are not valid criticisms. The government can only get work done by hiring companies to do the work. Hiring SpaceX has resulted in large cost savings especially in terms of developing new technology.
18-3-4-1-2-2,>it's just another contractor suckling the public teat.so you want the whole space industry to shut down and not lauch rockets. so you are against the entire space industry including nasas space exploration effortnot even efficient contractors like spacex that do stuff for the half the cost.
18-3-4-1-2-2-1,"I'm against dumping public money into heavily subsidized, for profit, private contractors at the taxpayer's expense, especially when that public money is essentially disappearing into an untaxable corporate structure that lobbies against the public interest on a regular basis. In instances like these, taxpayers are funding private profit and inevitably socialize any losses. It's not a net benefit to society, even by the standards of the system that produces the circumstances being discussed."
18-3-4-1-2-2-1-1,spacex provides the cheapest prices in the industry.>heavily subsidizedi think you need to know the difference between subsidies and contracts.spacex isnt subsidizes. its far from subsidized. elon put half of his networth to launch that company.profits are required to employ people and keep te industry running. you want services like rockets to be charity?>public interestyour space hate boner =/= against public interest. space industry is exactly in publics interest. espcially cost effective companies like spacex that has never asked for more money that the initial contracts unlike others who lobby.
18-3-6,"The government in general has this theme that they have to contract everything out because if they actually hired more government employees to do it, it would be socialism. So NASA contracts on this crap out but seems to have gotten lucky with SpaceX, I’m pretty SpaceX is basically 90% government funded so they are just an arm of the government now anyway."
18-3-6-1,Source for your 90% number? What do you mean by “government funding”?
18-3-6-1-1,Not private funding.
18-3-6-1-1-1,"SpaceX is entirely privately funded. The common confusion is that government contracts  (ex. NASA commercial crew program) are not “government funding.” SpaceX is a contractor, and is compensated for providing a service to NASA and the American taxpayer. That service being “Astronaut and science delivery to the international space station” which is competitively bid for by various other contractor companies. SpaceX is often chosen for many NASA missions because the Falcon 9 is an order of magnitude cheaper than the other competitors. NASA does not “fund” SpaceX. To put an a analogy together: NASA is like a homeowner who wants new wood floors—they solicit a bid to many flooring companies who come back with many different quotes, SpaceX being one of those companies. NASA then chooses the contractor they like best based on: cost, schedule, capability. SpaceX constantly wins contracts because they are cheapest while offering substantially more capability and availability."
18-3-6-1-1-1-1,"It's weird that people think of contracts as some sort of free money handout. Using their logic, Ford is government funded because they sell fleets of trucks and cars to the government, like the money they get from those sales is some sort of government subsidy for Ford."
18-4,Would be even more awesome if they were able to reuse the same booster in a 24hr timespan.
18-4-1,Hopefully we get that to see with starships. They are design to be low maintenance!
18-4-1-1,"Can't wait, thats going to be such a breakthrough."
18-7,I'm just here for the Musk and anti Musk fights
18-7-1,who cares?
18-7-1-1,Is this your first time in this sub?
18-8,But wait they just fired someone and I thought the company was supposed to implode from that.
18-8-1,"I figure if they had enough time to write that and organize a petition at work, then they probably weren’t contributing much anyway."
18-8-1-2,I have two questions:1. How much time do you think organizing a petition takes?2. What does Elon's boot taste like?
18-8-1-2-1,Other employees say they spent a lot of time at work harassing and bullying them into signing it. It’s their complaints that led to the firing.How does irrational hatred feel?
19,SpaceX Falcon Heavy dual-RTLS landing filmed from ~1.5 miles away
19-1,"Every time I see it, I think it's straight out of a Sci fi movie.  It gives me hope that we will soon find ourselves expanding beyond our atmosphere."
19-1-1,[Have you seen this ?]
19-1-1-1,I cry engineering tears of joy every time I see that.
19-1-1-1-1,this is my favourite
19-1-1-1-1-1,"That was an exciting day for sure, but I prefer [the one that survived]"
19-1-1-1-1-1-1,Didn't that one survive?
19-1-2,Also gives a little bit of hope that we can somehow overcome all the pettiness and small-mindedness down here on the ground. Love it.
19-1-4,I just wish Elon would act better
19-1-4-1,"For what it's worth, the president and chief operating officer at SpaceX is [Gwynne Shotwell].  She's the leader responsible for what they've achieved, not Elon Musk."
19-1-4-1-2,Gwynne is incredible and Musk hiring her was a great move on his part. But SpaceX is still very much Elon's brain child and vision.
19-1-4-1-2-1,">But SpaceX is still very much Elon's brain child and vision.For sure, but the magic is in making it happen on the day-to-day, I think."
19-1-4-2,I just wish people could figure out they don’t have to mention Musk just because someone mentions SpaceX rockets.
19-1-5,"Except its private, so there is no ""us"" involved. This is for a specific ""them"" and it aint you and me."
19-1-5-1,He means “us” as in humanity. Just because SpaceX is a private company doesn’t mean that they aren’t pushing us forward as a species.
19-2,Been to the falcon heavy launch before and the video does not do justice to how loud those four sonic booms are. You feel it in the ground all the way from Kennedy space center
19-2-3,Why are there sonic booms?  Aren't they slowing down?
19-2-3-1,"on approach, when they are much higher (before the video even starts for the first one), they are going faster than the speed of sound."
19-3,I absolutely love how rockets sound like they’re just ripping space or air.
19-3-2,They are definitely ripping through air.
19-3-2-1,Ik but i cant really put my imagination for it into words.
19-6,"Filmed by me at the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse, located ~1.5 miles (2.4 km) from SpaceX LZ-1/2, after the launch of USSF-44.This location is only open to those with KSC/CCSFS access; it is NOT available to the public.Heights for perspective…- Lighthouse: 151ft (46m)- FH boosters: 140ft (42.6m)[This has now been uploaded to YouTube.]Edit: More info"
19-7,"I have existential dread, and seeing things like this makes it better even if it's for a couple of minutes."
19-7-2,Don’t take existence too seriously - none of us get out of it alive
20,Spacex has conducted a Super Heavy booster static fire with record amount of 14 raptor engines.
20-1,"Now we make guesses about the next count.I'm thinking 20.  Partly out of extreme caution, partly because it would edge out the N-1."
20-1-1,Is the ultimate goal to test all 33 at once or the clamps couldn’t hold it? Maybe they test the other 19 and it’s good to go.
20-1-1-3,NASA demands a 33-engine fire so they're going to have to do it eventually.
20-1-1-3-2,I demand 50 engines! So there’s that.
20-1-1-3-2-1,Get a billion dollar plus contract with them like NASA has and they might listen.
20-2,"The guys on the NASASpaceFlight stream said it's equivalent to 37 Merlin engines. That's just over 4 Falcon 9s at once. 10 more than a Falcon Heavy.Copying a comparison chart someone posted on the SpaceX sub:Rocket | Liftoff Thrust MN (tons-force)---|---N-1 | [45.4]( (4,629)SLS | [36.6] (3,732)Saturn V | [35.1] (3,579)Energia | [34.8]( (3,548)**14x Raptor 2** | **[32.2] (3,283)**Shuttle | [31.3] (3,192)All that power and it wasn't even HALF of the engine set. Just crazy. I can barely imagine full 33 static fire, hopefully in the next few weeks."
20-2-1,"What's the N-1 actually?EDIT: nevermind, found it here  What a monster of a rocket. And it failed due to not enough testing."
20-2-1-1,"It was supposed to be the Soviet Union's big moon rocket, a rival to the American Saturn V that famously launched the Apollo missions. Unfortunately it failed (exploded) 4 times and was canceled."
20-2-1-1-1,"Yeah indeed, i was just reading it up myself. What a fascinating timeline that was. The N-1 really looks like old soviet scifi design. I've seen it before but didn't remember how huge it looked at its base (first stage with all the rocket nozzles)."
20-2-1-1-1-1,"You know how the N1 has those openings between stages? That's because they would hot stage it. What that means is that while the previous stage is still attached & burning, they start the next stage. Then when it's providing sufficient thrust (and exhausting the hot gasses on the previous stage's fuel tanks), they decouple."
20-2-1-1-1-1-1,I've blown up my share of KSP rockets trying this approach
20-2-1-1-2,"Fun fact, the Saturn V  F-1 engines weren't fully understood by US Aerospace Engineers at the time either. They got lucky with the geometry regarding combustion chamber harmonics. Attempts to make engines of similar size were unreliable. Which is why for decades engines were smaller and we simply tacked more onto rockets, instead of sticking with big engines.Also, the soviets actually got their hands on early blueprints for the F-1 engine. It was so ahead of its time in engineering and manufacturing techniques, for some time the soviets dismissed it as a planted fake to distract them. Edit: (this part may be from before F-1) One example, using rocket fuel to cool the nozzle. Kinda bat shit, but if you're careful, kinda brilliant cause the fuel burns more efficiently and completely if you try to ignite hot fuel vs cold fuel..."
20-2-1-1-2-1,"Regenerative cooling was already decades old and well known to the Soviets. If anything, the American technique of constructing the chamber and nozzle from brazed tubes was needlessly complicated and expensive, and modern engines use something more like the Russian approach, which used a liner supported by corrugated metal that formed the channels for the fuel."
20-2-1-1-2-3,"I wonder how much of that was due to the fact that many of the F1s details were changed from the blueprints to make the engines actually work. This is one reason we can't directly build new ones: we know they made modifications, but we don't know what modifications were made because they weren't written down."
20-2-1-1-2-4,So far ahead yet soviets turned out to be so far ahead with nk-33
20-2-1-1-3,"It is remotely possible that Sergei Korolev might have been able to get the N1 working.  It was his rocket after all and his skill as both a rocket designer and navigating his way through the bureaucracy of the Soviet Union were legendary.Unfortunately before that rocket could be completed, he had a mostly routine surgical procedure that got botched horribly and he died in a Russian hospital.  Of course conspiracy nuts say that wasn't accidental...given that was Russia in the 1960's it is hard to argue against such a suggestion too.I always wonder if Korolev had lived to the 1980's what might have been for the Russian space program?  The Korolev Cross from the Soyuz rockets is a fitting tribute to his genius and he deserves far more recognition too."
20-2-1-3,"So the N-1 had many many engines. At the time I think they just didn't have the computing power or programming knowledge to be able to sync up that many engines. Most rockets at the time used a fraction of the engines. Now with SpacX and other startups we are seeing the many small engine configuration again. Usually it's a less efficient design because the extra engines add more weight and complexity for not much more power.But now we have much more advanced engines and new materials that can withstand higher temps. So getting more performance out of small engines is possible. Also the many small engines alongside amazing automation, we can get Way more control which is absolutely necessary for landing.It's an exciting time to be a rocket nerd!"
20-2-1-3-1,"Thanks for this reply, very interesting. Yeah it's absolutely fascinating nowadays. I'm always amazed when i see clear footage, especially when boosters are shown re-entering orbit in a very controlled way and then landing. Still looks sci-fi to me. And i always cross my fingers for any rocket start. There are so many nowadays."
20-2-2,sooo 64.4 MN of thrust with the full set?
20-2-2-1,About 2.3 per engine * 33 engines in a full set = 75.9 MN total.
20-2-2-1-1,Not all of the engines can gimbal though right ? Is there a difference in thrust between the two engine types ? Or is the gimbal hardware the only difference?
20-2-2-2,Ja. Check out my reply just now. This thing is going to be off *all* of the chains.
20-2-2-4,"Super Heavy breaks all traditional definition of its namesake, I say we need a new class of rockets to match that power. Ultra Heavy works for me"
20-2-2-4-1,"It's payload to LEO isn't much more than the Saturn V though, it just has a better thrust to weight ratio. I don't think that justifies a new category because the definitions aren't thrust based."
20-2-2-4-1-2,"> It's payload to LEO isn't much more than the Saturn V thoughIn reusable configuration, yes. If they go ""full send "" and launch in expendable configuration we're in the ballpark of 250 tons to LEO, which is more than 100 more than the Saturn V."
20-2-2-4-1-2-1,"I totally forgot about reusability, but does it really work out to that? I haven't seen an expendable payload mentioned before.Does the space shuttle also get payload credit because it could be automated, stripped and expended?"
20-2-3,"Based on those figures, that's 234.5 tons-force (tf) per engine. Looking at the Wiki page, a Raptor 2 was achieving 230 tf back in Feb and, according to Musk, 250 tf is achievable so there's still performance being left on the table.But even at this performance, the full complement of 33 engines would be a hair over *double* the thrust of the SLS, and if Musk's claims of 250 tf are true, then the total thrust would be 8,250 tf ; *78% higher than the N-1*.That's fucking *bonkers*."
20-2-3-2,"What is the point of so much power? From what I understand, long distance expeditions suffer from lack of fuel and you only need enough power to get out of orbit."
20-2-5,"51,000 P-51 Mustangs. 8,600 F-86 Sabres. I could go on."
20-2-7,this one test was almost the same as a Saturn Vwhat the fuck
20-3,Pretty incredible they can keep that much force strapped to the ground
20-3-1,And that's only like half the potential force lol. Makes you think alot of the complexity must be holding it down and not destroying the whole rig
20-3-1-1,Especially since concrete is really bad at taking loads in tension
20-3-1-1-1,The stand is mostly steel and is likely anchored to thousands of metric tons of material below it. I lift heavy things as part of my job and its absolutely astonishing how little steel can lift so much.
20-3-1-1-1-1,> The stand is mostly steel and is likely anchored to thousands of metric tons of material below it.I think the clamps would fail before the stand ever budged
20-3-1-1-1-1-1,"They would. The same was true of the Space Shuttle. If the massive explosive bolts holding the vehicle down failed to detonate, the boosters simply *ripped them in half.*"
20-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,Technically the Shuttle used frangible nuts
20-3-1-1-1-2,"Well it better be many thousands of tons because we are talking about ~7,500 metric tons of thrust for the 33 engine static fire!"
20-3-1-1-1-2-1,A cubic yard of earth weighs about a tonne so yeah many thousands of tones plus the weight of the structure itself.
20-3-1-1-1-2-1-2,"Wait, no way that can be right?\[EDIT\] Numbers don't lie, a cubic meter of earth would weigh about 5,500kg.  Sheeeeeeit"
20-3-1-1-2,"That's why you don't just use concrete, right?"
20-3-3,"I remember reading about the Aerojet rocket they built in Florida that they dug a silo in the ground and pointed the nozzle upwards. So when they tested it, they rolled a test house that was on rails out of the way, and then fired the rocket into the sky.[&#x200B;The facility has been somewhat destroyed by vandals and urban explorers, but it's still there, abandoned, and as far as I know, the rocket in the picture above is still there, in the ground. The contract went to Morton Thiokol instead of Aerojet. That meant instead of a single large booster floating on barges up from the everglades to Cape Canaveral, it was booster segments shipped via train from the Dakotas... requiring O-rings...."
20-3-3-1,They fired the rocket into the ground you mean.
20-3-3-1-2,They gave the earth a little nudge.
20-3-5,I was thinking that as I watched it. I'd love to see an up close look at one of these structures after a test like this.
20-3-6,It slowed the earth down by a lot. That's why they are limited to 14. 15 engines would have brought back the dinosaurs.
20-3-6-1,"How about we flip the rocket, cover Texas with a bunch of them, and take this hunk of rock on an intergalactic journey."
20-3-6-1-2,"We deserve it.   By ""we"", I mean any of the back ass existence endangering conservative ignorant hicks, and by ""it,"" I mean a slow and inescapable pilgrimage away from the warmth of the sun while a life crushing chill envelops their cold heartless souls."
20-3-6-2,That's pretty much the premise for *The Wandering Earth* by Cixin Liu.
20-3-7,*and* this was with the rocket almost completely empty and no starship on top. The heavier it is the less the hold-downs actually have to...well....hold. Needless to say the hold-downs should be able to handle all 33 pretty easily it's now thought.
20-4,I love that this shit is so powerful it bugs out the cameras.
20-4-1,"This video was from the NSF live stream. The vibration probably messed with the camera's uplink antennas enough to make the connection drop. Higher radio frequencies and more finely dividing up the radio spectrum (as cell service carriers will do) makes this more common. IIRC, NSF uses a combination of mobile broadband providers for the most stable link, but when *all* the antennas start vibrating at once, you're kinda SOL.Expect a video with multiple angles once they can get back on site to retrieve the cameras."
20-4-3,"Als not sure the ground is shaking causing camera shake, or the tower is shaking..."
20-5,"Oh boy this will be fun to watch... *Engines fire, and all you can see is clouds of smoke, dust, and debris*Well... I shouldn't be surprised I guess."
20-5-1,"The sound is what really excite me. It's so fucking powerful, It capture the idea that this is a giant rocket much better than images can"
20-5-1-1,New sample strapped to ground trying to escape
20-5-4,They are just doing a little theatrical demonstration of their’s and Twitter’s stock prices rn
20-8,"sls thrust: 8,800,000 (if they manage to launch it)This test: 14*510,000 = a casual 7,140,000So 80% of potential SLS thrust on a random monday."
20-8-1,"And because congress gets to decide how NASA uses its money and what to work on, SLS is loads more expensive than SpaceX. Not a Musk fanboy but you gotta hand it to SpaceX"
20-8-1-2,Well he doesn't run SpaceX anyway.Edit: [For the downvoters:] scroll down to Key People.
20-8-1-2-1,Spacex does what Elon wants it to.  If that’s not the definition of running it I don’t know what is.  A Wikipedia article doesn’t dictate reality.
20-8-3,That's Block 1. Block 2 is 9.5 M tons.
20-8-3-2,"First of all, 9.5M lb is 4,750 tons, not 9,500,000. You're off by a factor of 2000.That aside, Block 2 is set to fly no earlier than 2032. Given how far behind schedule Block 1 is, I think it's safe to say that Block 2 is at least a decade away. As such, Block 1 is the only version worth discussing right now.Starship by comparison is very likely to fly in a 17.6M lb configuration within the next 6 months, with an 18.2M configuration coming in the not too distant future (certainly well before Block 2)."
20-8-3-2-1,I'm just wondering if they'll even be able to justify SLS by 2032. Depending on what requirements they end of setting it's entirely possible Starship will be human rated by that point. It seems a bit pointless to carry on using expendables lockets if a reusable one is on the table.
20-8-3-2-1-1,"Even if starship is never human rated by nasa (and let’s be clear that is not some sort of universal requirement, only nasa) then using crew dragon in addition to starship is still a WAY better solution than anything using SLS.   20x better according to a recent ars article."
21,"SpaceX will have launched 10 crewed missions before a single crewed Boeing Starliner.If the planned SpaceX crewed flight schedule holds up they will have launched 10 crewed flights to the ISS and/or to LEO before Boeing's Starliner COTS-1 launches its first  (currently 6 years later than planned)!Demo-2, Crew-1, Crew-2, Crew-3, Crew-4, Crew-5, Crew-6, AX-1, AX-2, and Inspiration 4. If Boeing has any delays that last long enough, SpaceX will notch 11 crewed missions (adding Polaris Dawn). By my count that also means sending 35 people to space."
21-1,"I wanted SpaceX to win, but I never expected Boeing to lose by this much. I'd hoped for competition, but it's just turned into the ""Stop, it's already dead"" meme."
21-1-1,It did seem like a race to capture the flag there for a minute.
21-1-1-1,"At this point astronauts will be like: ""...wait, aren't we going in Dragon?!"""
21-1-1-1-1,As I recall the commander of the first mission retired years ago to go to his daughter's wedding.
21-1-1-1-1-1,And the current commander has lost some of her spaceflight records
21-1-1-2,I was sure Boeing would have won that race. I was pleased but now it's like a local football team outscoring their opponent 40-0. Somebody just needs to call the mercy rule!
21-1-1-2-1,"It honestly feels like they gave up. As an engineer, it's crazy how much more productive I am when I have intrinsic motivation. Like easily 2x, but sometimes 4x. If this holds true for management as well, it's no wonder it's taking so long."
21-1-1-2-1-1,I'm sure engineers are also a lot happier when not overruled by accountants at every turn as well.
21-1-1-2-1-1-1,"""Accountants"" is probably an exaggeration of the paper-pusher's skill set."
21-1-1-2-1-1-1-1,"How about ""bean counters?"""
21-1-3,Yeah. At this point I’m not sure if it is more spacex’s accomplishment than Boeing’s utter incompetence.
21-1-3-1,With this big of a difference I'd say it's both
21-1-3-2,Both can be true.
21-1-5,"The difference is heritage in the organisation.SpaceX team already had the Dragon flying.When doing Crew Dragon, the whole organisation had an idea about certification obstacles and could mitigate a lot in an early stage.Boeing had not that much heritage and had retired many senior engineers.Mistakes then show up late in the project. The most public mistake was that a parashute failed to deploy at the pad abort test. The design shall not allow such faults, now it has a specific check point before launch."
21-1-5-2,"In Aug 1996 Boeing bought Rockwell's defense and space divisions.Rockwell built the Apollo Command Module in the 1960s and the Space Shuttle Orbiter in the 1970s.In July 1997 Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas.McDonnell Douglas built the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft in the 1960s.So, not a lot of recent Boeing crewed spacecraft design and engineering experience when NASA started its Commercial Crew Program in 2011.By 2011 SpaceX was flying its Falcon 9-launched Dragon 1 cargo spacecraft from which the Dragon 2 crewed spacecraft was derived.So, in retrospect, it's not surprising that SpaceX has completely surpassed Boeing in the Commercial Crew competition."
21-1-5-3,"As much as I’d like to credit SpaceX for showing up Boeing, you have to remember they were 2 years late. This is an insanely hard task to certify the capsule as meeting safety standards, so it is understandable. That they have launched the extra  missions is impressive, but not as impressive as Boeing’s failure to launch even their crew demo mission.I thought SpaceX would beat Boeing by at least one launch because of Boeing’s stodginess, but I think we have to be honest that Boeing has massively underperformed. If they had been awarded a sole source contract as had been originally planned, it would have been a disaster for our space program. Six years is an unacceptably long schedule slip and I’d be hesitant to launch with Boeing given the potential for skills and training to atrophy between missions as well as hardware age."
21-1-5-3-2,">Boeing’s stodginessIts not stodgy and its not Boeing. Boeing is actually Douglas, the company that went bankrupt in the 60s and was forced into a marriage with McDonnell and then went bankrupt again and was forced into a marriage with Boeing.The Douglas culture of cheap and dirty keeps killing them and they should have been allowed to die long ago but politics kept saving them.We WISH Boeing conservatism still existed."
21-1-5-3-2-2,Well that’s interesting.  Could you go into a little more detail about how their “cheap and dirty” is different from SpaceX’s “move fast and break things”?
21-1-5-3-2-2-1,Little anecdote. My 15 year old daughter told me she wanted to work for SpaceX. They have the magic that comes from doing the coolest programs. So they get the talent despite the hours and pay. Boeing lost a lot of talent and organizational knowledge when people quit and retired in disgust.
21-1-5-3-2-2-1-1,"Had I not had a true calling to switch careers and start teaching HS science, I would have moved from Goodrich Aerospace to SpaceX in a heartbeat.  Now that I am retiring from teaching…."
21-1-5-3-2-2-3,"SpaceX builds a protytype, flies it, breaks it, builds another that fixes the problem with the first one, rinse, repeat until it's reliable.  Boeing doesn't care if it ever flies as long as they can keep milking the contract."
21-1-5-3-2-3,Who made the decision to move management from Seattle to Chicago?
21-1-5-3-5,"The recent Boeing delay, a few months or so has been due to scheduling issues, SpaceX capsule was already docked etc."
21-1-5-3-5-1,Heh yeah SpaceX so far ahead they’re clogging up all the docks 
21-1-5-4,"Ironically, ""heritage"" was one of Boeing's arguments for bidding Starliner at twice the price of Crew Dragon."
21-1-5-4-1,"I might refrase my original comment. Replace heritage with ""institutional knowledge""."
21-1-5-4-1-1,I think it still comes back to shit management.  Boeing had that institutional knowledge but upper management undertook an intentional and determined effort to eliminate it (and the high salaries it commanded).
21-1-5-4-1-1-1,Totally agree. SpaceX succeded without heritage.
21-3,"Didn't Boeing got like a billion extra just to meet deadlines in sync with SpaceX? I wonder if they shall return it and do the honorable thing? ... Okay I'm sorry, I know how funny it sounds - Boeing doing the honorable thing."
21-3-2,"The difference of $1.8B was due to the higher bid of Boeing for the development and first group of flights($4.2B to SpaceX $2.6B), and they haven’t received most of it since they haven’t met the milestones. The real crime was the $287.2M “mission assurance” payment NASA paid to Boeing to try and mitigate the potential 18 month gap in launch availability. They should never have paid that after awarding a fixed price contract because it favors one bidder over the other. That was probably the most wasteful money NASA has ever spent."
21-3-2-1,"""That was probably the most wasteful money NASA has ever spent.""  SLS enters the chat...."
21-4,Crazy how bureaucracy slows everything down.
21-4-1,"Also known as ""Old Space"". They just seem to operate with a student playbook."
21-4-3,Whose bureaucracy are you writing about? Gov't regulation that assures adherence to safety and environmental standards is a good thing and I would not want to be without it. Boeing's internal bureaucracy that causes them to move slowly or make errors is another thing.
21-5,And people call SpaceX a money pitch hole 
21-5-1,I seriously doubt that there is anyone at this point in time who would consider spacex to be a money sinkhole.
21-6,"At the same time, NASA is adamant that they have two different options for crewed transport. Boeing isn't that interested in Starliner anymore, but NASA will keep paying. The curious thing will be once Starship becomes crew rated. Will NASA consider Dragon and Starship two different crew options and settle for that?"
21-6-1,"I think it’s a wise choice to keep two crewed options. For all it’s successes, all it takes is one F9 or Crew Dragon problem and suddenly the US is completely grounded again. Can’t risk it."
21-6-1-1,">I think it’s a wise choice to keep two crewed options. For all it’s successes, all it takes is one F9 or Crew Dragon problem and suddenly the US is completely grounded again. Can’t risk it.It's worked out just fine for the Soviets/Russians to be reliant on a single crewed option, and they've been doing that for half a century."
21-6-1-1-1,"Just fine, apart from multiple periods where they have to tell astronauts in space that they'll just have to hang tight for a few extra months while they figure out just WTF is going on. And the times when they ignore systems failing on the pad and just launch anyway, which is, by accounts from astronaut books from the ISS era, most launches. The Russians do not scrub. Ever. Hell, just read up on Mir sometime. The Russian program is quite decidedly not a model to emulate on safety in any f'ing way."
21-6-1-1-1-1,>The Russian program is quite decidedly not a model to emulate on safety in any f'ing way.When was the last time they lost crew?
21-6-1-1-1-1-1,Absolutely the wrong metric. They have had a large number of serious incidents that could have lost them crew if not for random chance. Including one just last year.
21-6-1-1-2,"A reasonable point, but it's also true that Soyuz uses very old and reliable tech that doesn't really fail. The only issues they've had in recent years have to do with the actual building and assembly of their rockets, not with design issues that caused them to go offline for extended periods of redesign and testing."
21-6-2,"interesting thought, will Starship be human rated faster than Boeing ? :D"
21-6-2-3,"I personally don't think so, but I also feel as if people vastly under-estimate just how fast a rapidly reusable, fully reusable rocket can be human rated. If they achieve their goals, all they need to do is fly more flights for the cost of fuel and refurbishment until they reach enough flights to show it's safe and reliable."
21-6-2-4,Yes.I'm not betting against SpaceX.Let's see whether Boeing is still a recognised aerospace brand outside the military space in five years. Yes I'm serious: you don't put the people responsible for the bankruptcy of two large aerospace companies in charge of your aerospace company unless you want that aerospace company to go bankrupt.
21-6-4,There's always Sierra as an alternative
21-6-4-1,"Coming soon to a Vulcan near you! The first dreamchaser for cargo missions is ready to go, just need ULA and BO to get their shit together."
22,SpaceX Makes History With 52 Launches In 52 Weeks
22-1,I find this part even more impressive> SpaceX marks their 150th consecutively successful launch.Now that's some reliability in the rocketeering business.
22-1-1,Any sense how this reliability compares to other rocket platforms?
22-1-1-2,"No other rocket has ever achieved that, not even Soyuz. It's the most reliable rocket in history."
22-1-1-2-1,And that’s with some rockets being reused even.
22-1-1-2-1-1,"Not just some, but a lot. They've done more flights on reused hardware than on brand new cores. Truly impressive."
22-1-1-4,"It is downright phenomenal. Falcon 9 doesn't have the highest overall success ratio for rockets with enough launches to matter, Atlas V likely holds that honour (1 partial failure in 95 launches). But Falcon 9 holds the record for most successful launches in a row, and has 100% success since the block 5 version started flying. There have been other really good rockets (Delta II, Atlas V and Ariane 5 come to mind), but none quite as good as Falcon 9."
22-1-1-6,"Honestly, that's a tough comparison. Most of (lol if not *all*)those flights are on boosters that have flown more than once. No one else is doing that."
22-1-1-6-1,"Yeah, but being more reliable with used parts than with new ones is even more impressive"
22-1-1-6-1-1,">Yeah, but being more reliable with used parts than with new ones is even more impressiveI want to remind you of the bath tub curve."
22-1-1-6-1-1-1,"I want to remind you there isn't a whole lot of evidence for the bathtub curve for complex devices where each individual component has already been tested, and SpaceX has never had a first stage failure new or used. We have enough data to say reuse is not inferior, we do not have any evidence it is superior. Which is exactly what SpaceX wants."
22-1-1-6-2,"Though on the flip side, a booster that’s already flown is one you know is built right"
22-1-1-6-2-1,"See that's the interesting thing. When they started reflying boosters, the industry was like ""Used boosters? We can't trust that!""Now they've gone full 180, and some don't want to fly their missions on a brand new booster.Now they all want ""Flight proven boosters"""
22-1-1-6-2-1-1,"Would qualify this. Companies want flight heritage, but moreso in the components used to make the rocket. If you had two boosters that were built with same components and teams, going to pick the newer one. It’s like saying a new 737 is worse than one of the same model that’s been in service"
22-1-1-6-2-1-1-1,>It’s like saying a new 737 is worse than one of the same model that’s been in serviceBut you would NEVER buy a 737 that hasn't been test flown.No passenger would ever sit in an aircraft for a commercial trip on the maiden flight.
22-1-1-6-2-1-2,"I think it's just that back in the early reuses, nobody (except SpaceX) knew if they can really be recovered without damage, since noone else could look at them in detail. Since then they have flown again and again, and that's proof enough."
22-1-1-6-2-2,"On the flip side, mechanical properties and conditions could have changed and remain hidden until failure"
22-1-1-6-2-2-1,Yeah I’m just saying it doesn’t inherently make the streak more impressive
22-1-1-6-2-2-1-1,"Yea what makes this impressive isn’t so much the consecutive launch streak (I think even Elon wouldn’t put much weight on it), but rather what they’ve been able to achieve on an economic basis. Economically, it’s impressive af. Falcon9 costs about $60m a launch and carries ~25% more payload than Atlas V. Average cost of Atlas V has been $225m (which having been in operation since 2002 would be materially higher accounting for inflation basis) and only dropped to $100m in 2020 after SpaceX started taking awards from them."
22-1-1-6-2-2-1-2,"Well, if you consider that they are landing them in between (i.e. launch AND landing strain - whereas others are just building new ones)...I think that's pretty darn impressive."
22-1-1-8,ULA used to be most reliable (Atlas rockets - which they are no longer flying) but SpaceX already has better numbers.
22-1-2,"It just hit me that your comment says 150 consecutive successful launches, wow what a feat."
22-1-3,I assume that count excludes landings? Any idea how many consecutive landings they've nailed now?
22-1-3-1,"Well, the last failed landing was last year (mission 108...Payload was successfully delivered to orbit but the booster failed the landing burn) ...which would mean a streak of 67 successful landings since then"
22-1-3-1-1,"Worth noting that that's more consecutive successful landings than most rockets have consecutive *launches*.I can only think of a handful that have done better - Falcon 9 itself(obviously), Ariane 5, Atlas V, Delta II, and Soyuz."
22-1-3-1-2,"b1069 landed hard last December, which imo counts as a partial landing failure, took them 10 months to refurbish and recertify. Thats only ~40 launches ago."
22-1-3-1-2-1,>b1069Any landing you can walk away from.Since the booster is being refurbished (which they wouldn't do if they weren't planning on using it again) I'd say that's a success.
22-1-4,"As much as I hate Elon (which with this being reddit I just know will attract his fanboys), I have a fuck ton of faith in SpaceX.They really do seem to know what they're doing."
22-2,Hopefully in a few years those launches will be Starships instead of Falcon 9'sLet's go space!
22-3,"Hater will always hate, this will always be impressive."
22-3-1,"Every other launch I want to see gets scrubbed, and then there’s SpaceX just killin’ it weekly"
22-3-1-1,"I was down in Florida to be disappointed by Artemis not being launched, but I did get to see the falcon 9 that Sunday take off exactly when it was scheduled to without a single hitch"
22-3-1-1-1,I saw that one too! I was on the north side near port Canaveral. It was cool seeing a bunch of fans gathered on a little patch of grass to see it
22-3-1-1-2,I love those night launches. I can see them from my balcony all the way down in Miami.
22-3-2,"Elon is a terrible person and the way he treats his employees is atrocious, but that being said, you can’t deny that he gets results."
22-3-2-1,"Ehh, I knew what I was signing up for and if I really didn't like it I'd quit.  Same goes for everyone else who works here.Elon is not somebody I would want to be friends with, and I agree he's definitely not a nice person.  The worst IMO is probably how he left his first wife.But his primary responsibility at SpaceX is to build an exec team who will run the company successfully and he's done an outstanding job of that.  Gwynne is arguably be the best CEO in the industry and all the engineering and production directors and VPs I've worked with over the years have either been outstanding, or have been quickly replaced"
22-5,Why weren't they contracted to launch Artemis again?
22-5-1,"""Let's be very honest again, We don't have a commercially available heavy lift vehicle. Falcon 9 Heavy may someday come about. It's on the drawing board right now. SLS is real.""NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, 2014"
22-5-2,Many reasons. They hardly existed when Artemis was started. Orion is too heavy for any SpaceX rocket to carry to the Moon. And Congress legally mandated SLS and Orion are used.
22-5-2-2,"Falcon Heavy was originally proposed in 2010, but rejected because it didn’t exist yet. Artemis missions can be done with two Falcon Heavies. So basically NASA has been wasting money on SLS every year since 2018. It’s what is called sunk cost fallacy."
22-5-2-2-1,>So basically ~~NASA~~ Congress has been wasting money on SLS every year since 2018.FTFY. NASA doesn't get a say in this. All the funds have been allocated in advance by Congress due to pork barrel politics. It's why they chose to reuse shuttle parts in the first place. NASA was hamstrung with this crap from the start so politicians could ensure their districts continue to get the same funding.Let's not blame NASA for Congress's political failings IMO.
22-5-2-2-1-1,"So what you’re saying is that it’s not NASA’s fault because they’re ‘just following orders’ - an excuse that never works.As a community we can help them, by supporting them, supporting them while they do what’s hard, not what’s easy - pushing back on congress."
22-5-2-2-1-1-1,Are you really comparing an agency that has their funding and contracts determined by Congress to war crimes?... This is the dumbest take I've seen in quite some time...
22-5-2-2-2,"It isn't NASA's fault, they are being forced to use SLS by Congress"
22-5-2-2-2-1,"Yes the the ‘just following orders’ excuse. NASA, the people who work for it, the people like us who support NASA, need to make our voices heard that SLS is a dead end. Currently the entire organization has deluded themselves to think SLS should be celebrated because ‘what can we do? Our hands are tied by congress’"
22-5-2-2-2-1-1,"> Yes the the ‘just following orders’ excuse.Yes, the government mandated it so they did it.  It isn't illegal, immoral, or unethical."
22-5-2-2-2-1-1-1,NASA's mandate is to innovate and explore - by that definition wasting billions while not advancing either is not right (unethical).
22-5-2-4,"Congress was put in place to squander tax dollars, so I guess they're doing a good job?"
22-7,"Meanwhile, NASA can’t even put fuel in the tank."
23,Environmentalists sue FAA over SpaceX launch license for Texas
23-1,They sue over every launch in Boca.
23-1-2,Spacex is going deal with the pad issues. The only way the plan works is high frequency launches and they can't rebuild the pad after everyone. There was already a water deluge system in the works and there will be more tweaks.
23-1-2-1,Launch from the ocean sea dragon style
23-1-2-1-1,That's just lawsuits with extra steps
23-1-2-1-1-1,How?
23-1-2-1-2,Unfortunately they ditched those plans. The oilrigs that were meant to be converted into launchpads were sold again last year and will probably get scrapped now.
23-1-2-2,No deluge system.  Just water cooled steel ~~diverter~~ flat steel block.
23-1-2-2-2,No diverter.
23-1-2-2-2-2,Omnidirectional diverter rather than a directional one as used by old fashioned launch pads /s
23-1-2-3,They should have waited until those measures were in place.
23-1-2-3-1,You understand the permit was issued on the assumption that worst case scenario is possible - namely the rocket exploding on the pad? Destruction of the concrete underneath the launch pad that is peanuts compared to that. And also a one-off.
23-1-2-3-1-2,"Of course, but the launch was deliberately made on an arbitrary date before the steel and water deluge were in place. It was negligence."
23-1-2-3-2,"Nope. This level of destruction was planned for in the environmental assessment approved by the FAA. As long as it is occasional, it was not unforeseen and unplanned for."
23-1-2-3-2-1,"Where? I read through almost all of the PEA and flight license and nowhere did I notice a provision for shooting concrete and rebar boulders into the ocean. I have no doubt spacex will solve this problem, but even Elon said they did not expect to destroy the pad like that"
23-1-2-3-2-2,">This level of destruction was planned for in the environmental assessment Which is what the lawsuit says.The lawsuits doesn't claim anything unexpected happens, it claims that the FAA should not have given SpaceX the permit for the impact caused."
23-2,Having a launchpad here is probably better for the environment long term as you'll always need to keep exclusions zones and people won't want to live near an active one.
23-2-1,That's the way it goes at the cape
23-2-1-2,There are many animals at the cape it’s great as long a there are no big spills
23-2-1-2-3,Tbf environmental studies are more important that simply just tracking wildlife population no?
23-3,"Oh no, all that sand and dirt that got scattered over all the other sand... and dirt."
23-3-2,what about the concrete
23-3-2-1,What about it? Concrete is not toxic in any way.
23-3-2-1-1,I'm not sure about this particular mix called fondag. Or something like that. But lime is a common ingredient in concrete. If chunks of concrete get into water it's going to change the pH level.
23-3-2-1-1-1,Completely harmless
23-3-2-1-1-1-1,Well there you go.
23-4,The same people who think nuclear power plants are bad for the environment and fusion is worse…
23-4-1,Who thinks fusion is worse?
23-4-1-2,People who think fission and fusion are the same. Woo scary words.
23-4-1-2-1,"don't belittle me, i watched that russian nuclear documentary thing one time, i know what i am talking about."
23-4-1-2-1-1,That one on HBO?
24,SpaceX is now launching 10 rockets for every one by its main competitor
24-2,You don't need to be a fan of Elon to be a fan of the folks at SpaceX. Amazing work they are pulling off. It's already changed the world and I hope they will continue to do so.
24-3,holy smokes anything Elon = bad I guessSpaceX should be considered as an overwhelming positive for humanity
24-3-2,Jesus I assumed you were exaggerating but this comment section is a cess pit.
24-3-5,"Whether someone worships or hates a celebrity, it's stupid.  But they think they're the smart ones and it's the other obsessed folks who are stupid.Meanwhile, reasonable people simply enjoy the advancements made to society."
24-3-5-1,Right now the pendulum has swung WAY over to the hate side. Like completely irrational-mouth foaming hatred.
24-3-5-1-1,"You mean Elon?  The asswipe that endorsed DeSantis of all people?  Hahahhahahahahahaahahahahahahhahahaahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha.  Of course he is hated. People now know that he is not trying to make a better world for everyone, but just himself."
24-3-5-1-1-1,"He said he voted R for the first time this midterm and somebody asked him which R president he'd lean toward and he said DeSantis. Far from an official endorsement and completely lacking of context as to why he believes it's prudent to lean toward DeSantis, perhaps good reason, perhaps bad. I don't even like Musk, especially after interviewing at SpaceX and learning they require min 20 hours overtime with no additional comp; however, it's important to have a contextual and constructive view instead of foaming at the mouth over a tweet saying he might lean toward somebody you don't like.TLDR there are better reasons to hate him"
24-3-5-1-1-1-1,"The only people foaming at the mouth are those who comment against Bill Gates, but bend over for Elon the trash."
24-3-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, I mean sure, but that's not really what anybody was just talking about..."
24-3-5-4,"Well, it's complicated. SpaceX has done lots of things that are great for society. But when SpaceX succeeds, their leader accumulates obscene amounts of money, and he is known to use that money for non-space things that are terrible for society. Many of which involve anti-intellectualism that directly contradicts the reasons I support space stuff.So do I want SpaceX to succeed? IDK. I wish their technology would succeed but their leader would fail in his personal campaigns. But given that success = money = power that isn't a likely outcome."
24-3-5-4-1,"I don’t really get what it is he is doing wrong other than being a troll and abusing the stock market for all it’s flaws. Other wise he made the software that first made it safe to buy things on the internet, is the main catalyst and biggest influence over the electric car boom and other 0 Emission energy technologies. He is working on making technology to help the physically disabled people walk and regain other functions, he is trying and admittedly failing at easing traffic in big cities, he is a huge boon to Ukraine being their only means of communication while they fight of a dictator, he lives with a relatively small footprint other than all the travelling he needs to do. I would say he uses his money better than most."
24-3-5-4-2,What has spacex done for society and not profit?
24-3-5-4-2-1,"Many things one is providing Ukraine communications after Russia took them all out. With out space X it’s hard to say how that war would be going. Also musk tends to share his advancements in technology, Musk reiterated twice that the intellectual property it’s developing in working with NASA is free for NASA to share with whoever it should wish. “Any SpaceX data should not be considered proprietary,” Musk said during the remarks. “It can be used by any of our competitors. No charge.” Then Tesla sharing its R&D for free, simply to help other companies make the switch to electric faster."
24-3-5-4-2-2,"Lowering the cost of Space launches while making them more sustainable and advancing the rocket technology & economy of scale, and global wireless high speed internet.Both good things for society, doesn't matter if they're profitable, good things can be done at a profit; really not interested in debating a profit vs altruism venn diagram."
24-3-5-4-2-2-1,"Right, but what does that do for society?"
24-3-5-4-2-2-1-1,"You can't figure out what globally accessible high speed wireless internet does for society?Or how the various scientific discoveries that come from a lower of cost space exploration help society? I mean, this is a SPACE subreddit...If you're not being purposely obtuse, I do suggest you look into it - it's a very exciting and interesting topic.Related: ["
24-3-7,For sure !! The guy could have 30 kids with his grandma and space x would still be a huge accomplishment betterment for humanity . Nice work Elon and team !!
24-3-8,Everything you said is why any SpaceX announcement just emotional confuses me. But I agree it’s an overall positive for what they’ve brought to the table.
24-5,I hate how Elon hate has just devoured this sub.How the hell can we not be excited about this!
24-5-2,Paid trolls just like every other sub.
24-5-2-1,I doubt they are paid. People just aren't that bright on average and everything is just so divided.
24-5-3,"Pollution from the rockets, climate change?"
24-6,ole elon really using US tax dollars more efficiently than pretty much any other program out there. showing how the old space industry was just a pit for money to go to various supporters of various congressmen.
24-6-1,Is spacex sponsored by tax money? I thought it was completely private
24-6-1-2,"It's a private company, but (like with every launch provider) a major source of revenue is government launch contracts."
24-7,"Not to judge harshly, since reusable boosters that come back like homing pigeons is very cool, but at what point will we insist that those who boost things into Earth orbit are responsible for bringing them back down?"
24-7-1,"SpaceX are actually pretty good about deorbiting stuff. They actively deorbit their upper stages, and they put Starlink sats into low initial orbits so that any faulty sats deorbit in a matter of months.Even once raised to operational orbits, they're still low enough that they'll be dragged back down in about 5 years time. Most other satellites take decades or even centuries to deorbit.SpaceX have even said that they think the FCC standard of deorbiting after 25 years is outdated and should be reduced, and are generally in favor of more strict regulations on orbital debris.This isn't necessary for any altruistic reason; SpaceX have more satellites than anyone else in LEO, so it makes sense that they'd be concerned about orbital debris, and thus take it seriously."
24-8,"Space X gambled the company on starlink being a success. If it is not, this will be one of the biggest wastes of resources of all time."
24-8-1,"To be fair, they've opened the door to solving some of the biggest headaches in aerospace such as the likes of reusability. Looking at the big picture, SpaceX has practically given a blueprint to every single rocket provider & launch agency around the world in roadmaps of rapid iteration, rapid cadence, reliable, and reusable rockets.Rocket-lab, Relativity, Blue Origin, ULA, ISRO, Arianespace, JAXA, CNSA, everyone. have been fed the schematics for cheap space access on a silver spoon.For that, I think SpaceX has done enough already. Starlink, Starship- everything which comes afterwards is just a bonus to spaceflight in general."
24-8-1-1,"That says nothing about starlink being a viable business plan. Starlink launches cost around 50 million each, they launch around 50 satellites each, that cost around 250k each. SpaceX wants around 40,000 satellites that must be replaced about every 5 years. That's 10 billion a year just to keep up with the satellites that are burning up.  They have around 250,000 customers right now. They will need about 10 million customers to break even on that cost alone. Other satellite internet companies have gone bankrupt with fewer than 100 satellites, that stay up in the sky."
24-8-1-1-1,"Damn, they should have asked you for business advice first."
24-8-1-1-1-1,"The real business plan is not to sell a service for a profit, it's to generate hype to pump the stock price, and use that money to operate until everything collapses or you can sell your stake to someone else."
24-8-1-1-1-1-2,"Spacex is a private company, very few people can actually acquire stocks"
24-8-1-1-1-1-2-1,Enough people to take 7.4 billion in funding.
24-8-2,Starlink is well on track for printing money. The demand is absolutely insane in industry.
24-8-2-1,How many subscribers paying how much would you estimate?
24-8-2-1-1,There's around 500k subscribers with most paying $110 per month including me. Some have the premium service though which is more. And there's still tons of people waiting to get theirs
24-8-2-1-2,"I can see 5k x $10k/mo enterprise customers, 100k x $500/mo customers and 2 M $120/mo customers in North America alone.I think the demand will be much higher, they're ultimately going to be bandwidth constrained in semi-urban areas.In 20 years I could see things changing with fibre everywhere, but there are just so, so many remote areas where $500/mo for good internet is a no-brainer."
24-8-2-1-2-1,">I can very conservatively see 5k x $10k/mo enterprise customers, That's enough to launch one rocket a year with no satellites in it.>100k x $500/mo customers That's enough to buy a second empty launch>and 2 M $120/mo customers in North America alone.That's enough for 4 more launches and satellites for them all.So you could launch 300 satellites a year, when 8,000 a year would be de orbiting. You see the problem."
24-8-2-1-2-1-1,"A launch is probably around $10 M cost and 53 satellites are around $16 M cost.What I detailed is $4 B per year or enough for 160 launches a year minus ground and operation costs. If that's 50%, then it's enough for 400 launches of 53 satellites every 5 years, or maintaining a network of 21,000 satellites.But that's just North America. The rest of the world could double the revenue, perhaps, which would support the 21k satellites while printing $4 B in profit a year.Starship will eventually reduce the launch cost by 10x in the 2030s and they'll be launching much bigger satellites that can do much more bandwidth so the network will end up being much smaller."
24-8-3,"Even if Starlink fails, the advancements along the way, and how it has affected the industry outside of just SpaceX, would have been worth it."
24-8-3-1,Which advancements in particular?
24-8-3-1-1,"Reusable rockets and satellite constellations would be two main ones that have spread from SpaceX's proof of concept to other companies following suit.Even if Starlink's internet service shut down forever tomorrow, other rocket launches would still advance using reusable stages to decrease cost, and other companies would still continue to develop constellations to provide internet to areas where it's otherwise impossible.  And that means more science, more access, for people around the world."
24-8-3-1-1-1,So if the satellite constellation fails then the influence that constellation had will be worth the investment. How? If it fails it will dissuade people from making mega constellations. And reusable rockets were worked out before starlink started.
24-8-3-1-1-1-1,"That's like saying if Ford goes out of business, companies won't make cars.The demand for the service constellations provide will still exist."
24-8-3-1-2,The booster landing alone was one of the most epic things I've seen in decades.
24-8-3-1-2-1,The Falcon heavy boosters landing is still the most sci-fi looking real thing I've ever seen.
24-8-4,SpaceX wouldn't have failed if starlink failed. They make too much money with reusablility technology and wouldn't have kept going with a failed technology if it was hurting the SpaceX mars goal.
25,SpaceX put 110 satellites into orbit in 36 hours. Elon Musk congratulated the company on 3 successful orbital missions
25-1,He is going to freak when I post the real-time location of all 110 satellites on the internet.
25-1-1,Bro how you gonna do that to those poor little boxes. That’s boxdoxxing.
25-1-2,Assassination coordinates! Perish the thought.
25-2,Picturing the scene from WALLE where they fly through a wall of satellites to get to space
25-2-1,"Yeah. I admit I know nothing on this topic, do we have a space junk problem?  If so are we doing anything about it or at what point do we do something about it?"
25-2-1-2,"The new generations of satellites are designed to be deposed off be the end of their life cycles. The Starlink satellites of SpaceX are a very positive example of that new thinking. Not only do they have thrusters to deorbit themselves if needed, they also fly low enough to reenter the earths atmosphere after a few months if they completely malfunction. So the fear of a ""Kessler syndrome"" because of Starlink is completely overblown by the media and social media posts."
25-4,"SpaceX is fascinating because its the one company that Elon founded where he seems to have actually build something that could be around for a really long time, and could grow to be worth a trillion dollars over the years... and it seems this success is mostly because he doesn't get too involved in the way he does in every single other company he's part of."
25-4-1,There are lots of stories about how folks at SpaceX managed to figure out how to manage Elon successfully. Something that it seems like other places haven't managed to do as well.
25-4-2,Just want to point out that Tesla’s market cap was above $1T for a while. ~$475B as of Friday.
25-4-2-3,Isn’t SpaceX different than Tesla? SpaceX is private I thought.
25-4-3,> and it seems this success is mostly because he doesn't get too involved in the way he does in every single other company he's part of.You don’t know much about Space-X then
25-4-3-1,"The further that man is from managing one of his companies, the better it does.  Every time he decides to be a mouthpiece of Tesla, he commits a big gaffe.  I like where the man puts his money, but with the catastrophe of twitter, his thin skinned narcissism prevents him from being a good leader.  Leaders who cannot admit they are wrong are the most dangerous and qualified for the well being of a company or any other leadership."
25-4-3-1-1,He micromanages every company. Talk to anyone that works at Space-X. Everyone’s ass clenches when he walks into a room because he will often ask low-level employees information about minute details. He makes decisions that no other big-tech CEO bothers with. To say he’s not heavily involved at Space-X is pure fiction.
25-4-3-1-1-1,That's kind of delusional.  The man isn't any good.
25-4-5,"I love it when people say spacex is success because the owner didn’t do anything but bluffing his way to success, completely opposite from ex enginner i heard from some podcat."
25-6,"Why post an article about it from a random website though? Your title says everything already. Three missions in 36 hours is insane. They're rapidly growing into the Starship program and maturing exponentially. All their experience with Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink/Starshield will apply and there will be some seasoned veterans in the company leading the charge when Starship is fully operational and they really start to expand the manufacturing."
25-6-2,Glad the company did all the great work. Not the other guy.
25-6-2-1,"Hey, whatever makes you feel better, champ."
25-6-2-1-1,"Go on then, what did he do, other than splash cash and brag? We will wait."
25-6-2-1-1-2,"What's your expectation of a person who leads a company, or several? Get in there and do some of the  CAD work?"
25-6-2-1-1-3,"Guy, I'm not about to write you a book about the origins of SpaceX in a reddit comment lol. Thankfully though, Eric Berger already did. Feel free to read it. [Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX]"
25-6-2-1-1-3-4,"Is totally acceptable to support the project while still acknowledging the owner as a dipstick, yeah I I used to think he was an all right guy and boy was I wrong"
25-6-2-1-1-3-4-1,">Is totally acceptable to support the project while still acknowledging the owner as a dipstickAlso acceptable to put a plug in your ass before you eat your dinner, and it will have the same effect on Elon's choices."
25-7,"At this point, spaceX probably is the only fond memory we have left of Elon"
25-7-1,Can’t we also be grateful that he is destroying the cesspool that is Twitter?
25-7-2,"I just prefer to pretend he isn't involved. The people there have a vision, do all the work and really from what I've read really prefer to keep him at arms length for what is becoming increasingly obvious reasons to anyone paying attention. It actually seems like a strangely aware moment where he actually congratulates them rather than trying to find a way to personally take credit for the achievement, so I guess he's got that going for him. However, he literally turned around and did something incredibly stupid to twitter again...."
25-7-2-1,"It’s not a strangely aware moment, he has always given the engineers credit. And he’s extremely involved in SpaceX; someone linked a video about that below that you didn’t watch. You’ve just decided to “prefer to pretend” various falsehoods.Edit: And here he goes again, thanking his employees today: "
25-7-2-3,And then you’d be wrong…read this and get educated. 
25-7-2-3-1,He's not some brilliant engineer or scientist he's a sociopath with an obscene amount of money that he unsurprisingly uses it to pursue whatever passing interest he has at the moment. About the only thing I do credit him with is the ability to invest in emerging technologies then use his money and influence to narrate how he invented them.
25-7-2-3-1-1,To pretend Musk is just some idiot with a lot of money is quite naive.
25-7-2-3-1-1-2,Musk isn't just some idiot with a lot of money. He is a sociopath who has mastered the art of manipulation with an obscene amount of money. He is a terrible person and engineer; he is a great venture capitalist.
25-7-2-4,Is that copium working for you?
25-7-2-4-1,Dude wtf he seems to have a completely neutral stance on this Your comment is unwarranted
25-7-2-4-2,Is relying on edgy little nonsense words working for you?
26,SpaceX’s Falcon rocket family reaches 200 straight successful missions
26-1,"I'm old enough to remember the depressing constant criticism and remarks from the media, other launchers, and arm chair experts in the beginning. I can't tell you how many times I heard ""Good for them for getting a successful launch, but ULA has over a hundred, Atlas has over a hundred, SpaceX won't last long after a failure, it'll take them decades to be as reliable as what we have now."" etc etc. Then it was the ""Land a rocket? Why don't you focus on not blowing them up at launch and let the big boys work on the cutting edge new tech, it's a pipe dream"".Now SpaceX has as many or more LANDINGS than some companies and countries have LAUNCHES.People really love to talk shit about the new kid until he's doing wheelies around you at a record pace. It's amazing what they have accomplished in the last decade alone."
26-1-1,"The same thing is repeating right now about Starship, even from some so-called fans of SpaceX. It was atrocious watching the nonsense from some people following the Starship launch, people who I thought knew better. (Like the hot takes from several of the writers from nasaspaceflight on their discord. Chris was good though, as usual.) I was expecting negative hyperbole from the media, but not from SpaceX fans. I feel like there's a lot of SpaceX fans that have only become fans of SpaceX in recent years, and weren't around for the hairy days early on. More people need to read Eric Berger's book on the early days of SpaceX. Starship is Falcon 1 and very early Falcon 9 all over again, but larger."
26-1-1-2,"I have been following musk since 2002.  I soaked up all info I could.  Yes, SX's harsh criticism from old aerospace and politicians were abundant.  They tried to stop SX.  Musk never gives up."
26-1-1-2-1,"Wow 2002, that's really early on. How did you even hear about him? It must have been from Paypal?"
26-1-1-2-1-1,"I read about it on Slashdot.  But yes, ""Paypal guy is starting a rocket company"" was the title, something like that.  The comments were overall very dismissive, what a surprise.I took a trip to SE Asia in 2006.  Showed some folks there a video of the Falcon 1 launch.  Told them that ultimately this company will be going to Mars!  Or the moon, I can't remember.  Whatever Musk was talking about back then."
26-1-1-2-1-2,"Well, I was reading a San Jose newspaper in the breakroom, of my workplace, at Travis AFB, Ca, at the time.  We all joked about the article reporting that a newly Silicon Valley millionaire was going to build rockets.  We all stated that he should give that money to us, since, he was going to throw it away.   I decided, then, to follow him.  I was still skeptical when he transported his first F1 rocket to D.C. and parked it in the streets.  That had never been done before. That showed his strong character to do and accomplish the unexpected.  I started commenting on most of the early space media forums, in 2007 and 8."
26-1-1-2-1-2-1,"Awesome. I remember going through a lot of the same but around 2008-2010-ish. I was skeptical at first and then got turned around after the final Falcon 1 launches (was neutral then), and then extremely positive starting around 2011-ish. I remember having an argument with a co-worker (in a university lab that built cubesats) about SpaceX. He claimed SpaceX stole all of it's ideas from contractors. He later went to work for NASA JPL and is still there."
26-1-1-2-1-2-1-1,My cousin has worked at NASA JSC since graduating college in the 90's.  It blew my mind that she was one of the un-named nasa engineers selected to work with SX building the Crew Dragon after SX's 2014 selection.  It was a pretty interesting conversation.
26-1-1-4,"It's absurd, the Starship launch proves beyond a doubt that the system will work 100%, silliness with the launch pad aside, that's an easily managed problem brought about by circumstances unrelated to the rocket. It's an absolute success and the haters just can't stop hating, disgraceful."
26-1-1-4-1,"The real hard problems are still to come, namely the catching system and the in-orbit refueling of cryogenic propellants. Both things that have never been tried before."
26-1-1-4-1-1,"... also reentry of Stage 2. Yes, there's Shuttle as a predecessor, but Shuttle only reentered from LEO speeds. Coming back from lunar or Mars speeds is going to be quite the challenge."
26-1-1-4-1-1-1,"Long term yes, but currently that's not needed in order to make it a reusable vehicle for LEO travel."
26-1-1-4-1-3,In-orbit refueling is the one that concerns me.  They have to send up a stupid number of tankers to refuel Starship just once.  The only way I can see the process being feasible in early stages is if they already have 13ish tankers loitering in orbit waiting for the actual Ship to launch.  Otherwise they’ve got 13 chances to blow up the pad and prevent future launches while a half-fueled vehicle sits in orbit playing tag with orbital debris.
26-1-1-4-1-3-2,> They have to send up a stupid number of tankers to refuel Starship just once. The only way I can see the process being feasible in early stages is if they already have 13ish tankers loitering in orbit waiting for the actual Ship to launch. The announced plans have a Depot in orbit that will be pre-filled before the Ship launch.
26-1-1-4-1-3-2-1,"In a way, that makes more sense than shuttling endless loads of CH4 and LOX to a ship, with the attendant danger to ship and landing tower...But it's also another piece of orbital hardware they need to design and build.   I'm guessing that it'll just be a specialized ship with pumping hardware to move propellant around and enough solar and refrigeration hardware to keep the fuel from boiling off. I wish I could see their long term roadmap. I'd love to see if there are plans for some ISRU plants on the moon. The entire plan is just a prisoner of the rocket equation and the gravity well."
26-1-1-6,"Lmao right? It’s their **very first** attempt! I’d like to know if people actually believed it was going to reach orbit on the first attempt!Like how insane, or how godly do you think SpaceX is to believe they can do that in a single try?! They’re still humans after all. Really fast innovating humans, but still human nonetheless."
26-1-1-6-2,"Launch succeeding on the first try is generally the norm when you look at historical launches from anyone with launch experience, and launch is the portion of the flight that held the least surprises.I'd have been shocked if starship reentered successfully. The launch not succeeding is fairly disappointing."
26-1-1-6-2-1,Yes in normal industry. However nobody else also move and innovate as fast as spacex. Historically spacex usually succeeds in average after the 3rd attempt.
26-1-1-6-2-2,"Starship is not a me-too rocket. (Popular concept in pharmacology when a company comes out with a slightly different drug, a me-too drug, to get a slice of the market). It is a completely new technology from flamey to pointy end.  It is reasonable to expect flaws in the first launches with so many unproven technologies."
26-1-1-7,"I mean I wasn't around during the early days and by the time I was F9 landings were routine. Takes 3 minutes on Wikipedia to look at Falcon/Merlins first orbital test flights to notice that those had engine issues too. Not sure if people just want to be spoon-fed information or just want drama, but I don't get it."
26-1-1-7-1,"The last twenty years basically went like this:""SpaceX will never get to orbit.""""Sure, SpaceX got to orbit, but they'll never get people to pay to launch on their rockets.""""Sure, SpaceX has paying customers, but they'll never get reusability to work.""""Sure, SpaceX is landing first stages but they'll never make it cost-effective compared to building a new one.""""Sure, SpaceX reuse is cheaper than building new stages, but...""I've no idea whether they'll get Starship to work, but all the same naysayers will be crawling out of the woodwork to say 'nay, sir! I say nay!' along the way."
26-1-2,"I remember an article where the then-head of NASA was talking about the Falcon Heavy, calling it something akin to a paper rocket that was going to be a lot harder to develop than SpaceX thought and would take years of hard work to bring to fruition. Meanwhile, he said that SLS was a real rocket that was already being built and tested and thus would beat it to flight.Well, Falcon Heavy actually was a lot harder to develop than SpaceX thought.  And it did take longer than their optimistic timelines.  Yet it still beat SLS to flight by over 4 years! :-)"
26-1-2-3,"Falcon Heavy is basically a dead end still. It is sort of in a Falcon 5 type zone. After F1, they planned a F5 .... but the F9 got nicely into development and F5 became pointless and never flew, even F1 got cancelled since F9 looked so good.Now FH has flown but with Starship coming, the value of working on it is pretty low and it's effectively abandoned (even if it flew a few times). If SpaceX can prove out Starship, they'll agressively push all their customers to it, we certainly won't see any FH launches after that point... and F9 launches will drop off relatively quickly, certainly starlink will switch straight away.SLS is as dead as congress wants to blow money on it. Gov rockets aren't about the rocket though, it is about jobs to specific regions."
26-1-2-3-5,"Falcon Heavy still has an important role to play - but will obviously be replaced by Starship at some point.But Starship is not yet ready, so if you have a Falcon Heavy class payload to launch, then the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle is your present day solution."
26-1-3,"I swear I remember seeing a comment years ago saying it was stupid for SpaceX to try to land in the early days, and they should focus on not blowing them up on the way up first."
26-1-3-1,"It was a common criticism as if you can't have a roadmap of multiple priorities to shoot for. That was part of why SpaceX was ultimately successful, from the beginning they were trying to do something new each step of the way rather than become yet another launcher. All old bloated companies fall into a complacent routine once they've been around awhile. Google is in the midst of this right now. It's always good to have new companies shake up business, it pushes innovation and does nothing but benefit consumers."
26-1-3-2,">it was stupid for SpaceX to try to land in the early days, and they should focus on not blowing them up on the way up first.Hard to believe folks managed to overlook the obvious - every launch meant they had a free test opportunity for landing. It cost them nothing in rocket hardware - if they'd followed conventional wisdom the booster would end up in the sea anyway. Working on improving the robustness of a rocket so it can land will inevitably improve its robustness overall, ie not blowing up on the way up."
26-1-5,"Thanks for reminding me! This brought a lot of hope back for SpaceX’s Mars missions for me, which I have painfully realised has probably slipped one launch window further into the future. SpaceX did exactly what they set out to do when everyone said it was impossible, although they were behind schedule with it. It doesn’t matter if they’re behind in their Mars schedule as long as they get there in the end."
26-1-5-1,"Schedules always get adjusted with any large and innovative project, it's the goal that counts. Schedules and timelines are literally just guessed, but they're good to have because it keeps people marching towards a goal. If you set the date too far out people get lazy. If you make it too soon, people give up or panic. Better to set something reasonable and adjust as needed."
26-1-6,>y love to talk shit about the new kid until he's doing wheelies around you at a record pace. It's amazing what they have accomplished in theThe reason people like to talk shit is because 99 out of 100 times a hyped start up gets more hyped - it doesn't pan out.
26-1-8,"Problem is that even now those trolls won't change their opinions, since facts never mattered, it was always about being more right than you.  But at least they have to shut up now."
26-2,"> As for SpaceX’s success streak, reaching 200 missions without losing a payload due to a rocket malfunction extends a record unparalleled in the launch business.> United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has amassed a 97-for-97 success record for its Atlas 5 rocket since its debut in 2002. Going further back, the Atlas rocket family, which includes earlier launcher designs with different engines, has a string of 172 consecutive successful missions since 1993.Even more remarkable: > With Wednesday’s Starlink mission, SpaceX has a streak of 116 successful booster landings in as many attempts since early 2021."
26-2-1,116 consecutive successful booster landings? That's unbelievable. I remember watching the first few attempts and dreaming of the day it was this ordinary. Incredible.
26-2-1-2,More consecutive successful landings than Shuttle. In all likelihood more than Soyuz before the end of the year. Yet some people will still say that propulsive landings can't be made reliable enough for crewed vehicles.
26-2-1-2-1,">Yet some people will still say that propulsive landings can't be made reliable enough for crewed vehicles.I don't think there is necessarily a contradiction here, those same people would probably argue that shuttle was not safe for humans either."
26-2-1-2-1-2,"The shuttle was absolutely not safe enough - that’s a big part of why it was grounded, alongside cost."
26-2-1-2-1-3,"Nah, people I've argued with see wings and think ""more safe"""
26-2-1-2-2,The boosters aren't having to land from orbital velocity though. Re-entry followed by propulsive landing has not yet been shown to even be possible. Hopefully starship will be fixing this over the next few years.
26-2-1-2-2-1,"Dragon's orbital velocity was shed long before it would be near the ground. For the last part of its fall it would be at terminal velocity, IIRC. Landing burn would've started at a very low altitude. (Source for low altitude: An ex-SpaceX engineer on Quora said the burn would start at an altitude far below one at which a back-up chute could be deployed in case of failed engine starts.)"
26-2-1-2-2-1-1,"Yes, but the engines have to survive the re-entry and be able to be relit. Dragon doesn't have to do that. The parachutes are nicely packed up inside the capsule and are far, far simpler than rockets. The shuttle engines also didn't have to relight. Even then, that spacecraft didn't always manage the re-entry part. I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible, but it will be a lot of landings before it can be seen as safe."
26-2-1-2-2-1-1-1,"> The parachutes are nicely packed up inside the capsule and are far, far simpler than rockets.And yet parachutes on spacecraft have a dismal failure rate.Soyuz 1 was lost due to parachute failure, one of the Apollo launches had a parachute failure (there's a reason they had three), some sample return missions have suffered due to parachute failures, etc."
26-2-1-2-6,Reliable yea. Nauseating…also yes
26-2-1-2-6-1,"For those us who paid attention these last 50 years, the success and promise of SpaceX is exhilarating.  Starship's final flip before landing into the chopsticks: Now that's nauseating."
26-2-1-2-6-1-2,"Here's a question... The entire point of the flip maneuver is for slowing down from orbital missions, right?I'd imagine starship would use SIGNIFICANTLY less fuel for simple suborbital hops, even long distance ones like NY-Australia or something, to the point where you could do multiple re entry burns if needed and not require the belly flop at all for human flight."
26-2-1-2-6-1-2-2,"Flip would have to be more gradual with a Starship full of business-class passengers.  But Starship will come in with the same belly flop and flip, since terminal velocity going tail first is far faster due to less air resistance.   When coming in from orbital velocity, most of the potential energy is lost through air resistance.  So I doubt suborbital hops will burn significantly less fuel coming down.   A ton of extra fuel coming down means many tons of extra fuel at launch, needed to send that ton of fuel up.  The tyranny of the rocket equation."
26-2-1-4,I was born in the mid ‘40’s and have lived through everything since Sputnik. I hope I live long enough to see man living on the moon!
26-2-2,"> a streak of 116 successful booster landingswhat's interesting is that NOBODY is even close to attempting landings like SpaceX is.  and if SpX doesn't rest on it's laurel and blows it due to boredom, it will probably be a decade before another launch service comes close to 100 successful landings altogether."
26-2-2-2,"> what's interesting is that NOBODY is even close to attempting landings like SpaceX isSome operations in China may be.  I believe there have been test flights, like those Grasshopper tests SpaceX did in Texas."
26-2-2-2-2,All i've seen on that is they added grid fins to steer the rocket away from cities.  Are they landing them now too?
26-2-2-2-2-2,"One test flight that we've seen. Very much like Grasshopper. And yes, it uses grid fins."
26-2-2-3,China might surprise people and do it sooner than that. They are actively working on a Falcon-9-like reusable booster and once it is working they will likely have a similar  launch tempo.
26-2-2-3-2,"Thats been the same story for many years now and each time it fizzles out because no matter how fast they copy, they will always be many steps behind before ever even getting to test articles"
26-2-2-3-2-1,"Well no one else is even bothering so they are further ahead than the rest, and also have the launch tempo that no one else but SpaceX has."
26-3,Anyone else here remember the dreadfully long wait after CRS-7? Those 6 months felt like forever but we got rewarded with the orbcomm launch and the first successful landing. I was watching it at 2 am and it was perhaps the coolest thing I'd ever seen live.Then a few months later we got the amos explosion on the pad which felt so painful because we knew it was gonna be a few months again without a launch. Wasn't that the last failure or am I forgetting something?
26-3-1,"It was the last failure to have lead to a loss of mission.  A couple anomalies have happened since:    * In March 2020: [Starlink 5 v1.0] lost an engine during ascent leading to a failed booster recovery (cleaning fluid left in an engine line during the refurbishment process)  * In February 2021: [Starlink 19 v1.0] lost an Merlin 1D engine during ascent, leading to a failed booster recovery (Hole in heat-shielding engine cover allowing recirculating hot exhaust gases to damage the engine)"
26-3-1-1,"I think there was a defence payload loss. But that wasn't a Booster failure, it was a final separation failure from a bespoke mount (not spacex standard)."
26-3-1-1-1,"On most missions SpaceX is responsible to the release of the satellite from the payload adapter but that was not the case on this mission. Usually SpaceX supplies the payload adapter and integrates the satellite to the adapter. On this mission the contractor, Northrop, supplied the adapter and satellite, and integrated the satellite to the adapter. SpaceX performed their responsibilities perfectly and it was Northrop that was responsible for the lost satellite."
26-3-1-1-2,Or so they say.
26-3-1-1-2-1,"While paranoia is probably unfounded here, there is actual precedent.Look up the story behind the Misty Satellite Program.  Rumors the first one was lost, but it was spotted by birdwatchers (amateur satellite spotters) years later.  Second one claimed to have broken up on launch, but most of the debris looks like deliberate decoys, etc."
26-3-1-1-3,Zuma...
26-3-1-3,"This is why their design is so important- with engine out capability, they can lose 2 engines and still complete the mission.  This will be even better with SS, as the recent test showed lol"
26-3-2,">Those 6 months felt like foreverAfter the shuttle Challenger disaster, it was two years and eight months until the shuttle flew again. For the shuttle Columbia disaster, it was two and a half years and then another year when the return to flight mission had issues. Compared to those, the Falcon 9 return to flight was positively speedy. I remember thinking how remarkable it was that it only took six months."
26-3-2-1,Yes but there was no human space flight on these fast returns to flight.
26-3-2-1-1,He's so close to realization here.
26-4,Amazing. Like many I can remember wondering if they were going to make it years ago. Pretty incredible.
26-6,SpaceX really is so ahead of the competition. Remarkable.
26-7,I cant wait for this record to be met with starship....Kudos spacex staff! U2 Elon!
26-8,"I became a spacex fan in 2015, when the first water landings were being trialed I believe. I hadn't really heard of them before this. The next 5 years or so were so exciting for me I learnt so much.I have a confession though. The last 2-3 years their incredible success has become boring! I almost can't believe the words I'm typing."
26-8-2,That’s like the ultimate accolade - when you stuff gets boring - it means it’s so reliable..
27,"SpaceX launches tenth crewed mission, third fully commercial flight | SpaceX has rapidly become the world's most prolific human spaceflight provider."
27-1,This was also the 1st time that a Dragon's (*edit: Dragon 2*) Falcon 9 1st stage landed at the Cape instead of downrange on a barge. That'll be great for turnaround times and cost if they keep doing it. The manifest shows 5 crewed Dragon flights this year: 2 ISS crew rotations and 3 private flights. That'll be insane if it holds.
27-1-1,"> This was also the 1st time that a Dragon's Falcon 9 1st stage landed at the Cape instead of downrange on a barge.Several Dragon launches have had the booster do RTLS landings. This is the first with a Crew Dragon, and maybe the first with a Dragon 2."
27-1-1-1,"It's the first for dragon 2, which is what makes this such a significant milestone."
27-1-2,I believe it may have also been the first 3-engine landing burn for an RTLS (return to launch site) that wasn’t a Falcon Heavy mission.
27-2,SpaceX has been flying crew for 2.5 years. In that time they have flown 38 people to space. The Shuttle in its first 2.5 years only flew 26 people and it could fly 7 people at a time.
27-2-1,Damn that’s actually pretty crazy. Probably cost way less too than the shuttle missions
27-2-1-1,"A shuttle mission was about $1.6 billion per flight.For a Falcon 9 launch, it's about $67 million per flight.Though, crewed flights bump this up to about $200 million per flight.Still a significant savings."
