Every single car seems to have the same muddy handprint on the headliner too, almost like it’s a stamp of approval from the dockyard workers.

My thought, a car should last well over a decade, really 20+ years if you don't put crazy miles on them (well, who knows with the way cars are built now). Those monitors are basically tablets. What happens when it inevitably fails in 6 years? With the rate tech progresses, those are going to be ancient. Unless they have a shit ton of those set away for replacements (doubt), is the vehicle just basically totalled at that point? Hopefully they make them universal enough to just install them from newer models, but with the way car manufacturers are I'm sure it's going to be specific to the exact vehicle.

With AI in general, we have to get used to doing fewer repetitive, monotonous tasks. Which doesn’t mean we should turn our vigilance or executive function off. We just don’t need to constantly do the basics. Throwing up our hands as if this doesn’t work well seems lazy. When humans created assembly lines there were many new dangers, but overall things got better for everyone. We just learned to navigate the new dangers.

A touch screen is all a smooth surface that activates as soon as you make any contact.I do think there are ways to add feedback to the touchscreens to make them more usable without needing to be looking at them to use properly.
