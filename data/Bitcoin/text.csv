1-2-1,"In the simplest terms, a computer uses math to complete a highly complex algorithm. This algorithm's answer is then fact checked by a group of other miners (this is why bitcoins take time before being available). If everyone agrees that the answer is correct, it's ""minted"" or verified by everyone (the blockchain) and the minted answer (bitcoin) is awarded to the computer that did the processing. The answer itself isn't worth anything, it's only used to provide the coin in the first place. As coins are mined, further complex algorithms are used to avoid devaluing the coin.

(You can't claim that you think BTC is a good currency while at the same time be yelling ""buy the dip"" and ""BTC is going to moon"" to whatever ridiculous threshold you decided to choose. A volatile currency is just a bad currency and people will move and use something less volatile for trade.So this gets to the heart of the matter, if most people are unwilling to spend their bitcoin and most people are unwilling to accept it for goods or services then it is centralized by all the exchanges you need to actually convert it into something you can use in your country.

Comment4 presents the perspective that some individuals may choose the $100 cash over the Bitcoin because they may not be familiar with the process of converting Bitcoin into dollars and may perceive it as a risky endeavor.

86-3-3-1-1,Optimum cooling obviously. He doesn't need any fans because he's got a natural breeze.,Causal,Agreement,"Causal Explanation: The relationship between the sentences in this conversation is classified as ""Causal"" because each sentence provides a cause-and-effect relationship or explanation for the previous statement.   In comment1, the person mentions using chain link to protect the hardware from the elements, implying that the hardware is exposed to potentially damaging conditions.   In comment2, the person questions why the setup looks ""ghetto"" (implying it is not well-maintained or aesthetically pleasing) despite the person having expensive items like AirPods and an iPhone. They suggest that the money could be used to live somewhere better. This implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the person's financial choices and their living conditions.  In comment3, another person assumes that the person with the Bitcoin mining setup likely has a more robust structure for living, but questions why they choose to keep the rest of their gear outside. This suggests that there is a reason or cause behind the person's decision to keep the equipment outside.  In comment4, the person responds by suggesting that the reason for keeping the equipment outside is for optimum cooling. They propose that the natural breeze serves as a cooling mechanism, which explains the person's choice to keep the equipment outdoors.  Overall, the conversation demonstrates a causal relationship as each comment provides a cause-and-effect explanation for the previous statement.","Agreement Explanation: The logical relationship between comment3 and comment4 is agreement. Comment3 suggests that the person in question may have a more robust structure for living, implying that the rest of the gear is placed outside for a specific reason. Comment4 agrees with this suggestion by stating that the gear is placed outside for optimum cooling, taking advantage of the natural breeze. Both comments align in their understanding of the situation and provide complementary explanations for the setup."

For example, comment1 suggests that the hardware needs protection from the elements, which leads comment2 to question why the person doesn't use their money to live somewhere better. Comment3 then speculates that the person likely has a more robust living structure, but the question remains why they choose to keep their gear outside. Comment4 provides a causal explanation, stating that the person opts for optimum cooling. Finally, comment5 elaborates on the potential consequences of this setup, highlighting the natural elements and critters that could negatively impact the electronics.","Disagreement Explanation: The logical relationship between comment4 and comment5 is ""Disagreement"" because comment4 suggests that the setup benefits from optimum cooling due to natural breeze, while comment5 presents a counterargument by highlighting the potential negative effects of natural elements such as dirt, debris, rainfall, and critters on the electronics. Comment5 disagrees with the notion of natural cooling being beneficial and points out the potential risks and drawbacks."
