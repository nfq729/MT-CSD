1-2-1,"In the simplest terms, a computer uses math to complete a highly complex algorithm. This algorithm's answer is then fact checked by a group of other miners (this is why bitcoins take time before being available). If everyone agrees that the answer is correct, it's ""minted"" or verified by everyone (the blockchain) and the minted answer (bitcoin) is awarded to the computer that did the processing. The answer itself isn't worth anything, it's only used to provide the coin in the first place. As coins are mined, further complex algorithms are used to avoid devaluing the coin. This is why we went from using cpu to gpus (which are better at mathematical computations in this setting) to apus/ASICs (standalone bitmining systems that only do number crunching for these situations).",none

1-2-1-1-1,This. It's ramming inputs over and over and over again which is why it takes so much energy to do.,none
1-2-1-1-1-1,Do miners have to write their own algorithm that solves it? Or is that like open source and it’s really just about the power/energy being used.,none
1-2-1-1-1-1-1,"No, they use the SHA-256 algorithm (in the case of bitcoin) which has been around for decades. There's no other option, because thats whats in the protocol.

Maybe you have a Steam account that has 500 games on it, there would someone willing to pay for it which gives it value. Same thing with bitcoin/crypto in general. Someone wants the particular crypto currency thus giving it its value.",none

It is backed up by other currencies that are also backed up by other currencies.So it is only an illusion of it being backed up by something tangible.So what gives cryptocurrencies value is the same thing that gives it to real money and that is demand.People believe Bitcoin has value, so it has value. Because they believe it has value they want to buy it. Them buying it raises it's price. Then it's just supply/demand that settles the final price.",none
1-2-1-2-1-1-1-4,"It's not backed by anything.The idea (and a lot of people struggle with this) is that bitcoin has properties which make it good to use as money (portable, verifiable, divisible, robust, fungible, scarce, censorship-resistance) and that therefore people will use it as money. And don't worry, this was quite a leap for everyone, in the early days of bitcoin it had zero value even to the people interested in bitcoin. It was kind of a chicken and egg thing who would accept it as money first when no one else did... but eventually someone made the leap and traded 10k bitcoin to someone else for a couple of pizzas and that in a way established the first price and a market eventually developed from there.But bitcoin is not backed by anything except its own ability to function.",none

Everything from measuring black-hole spin to folding proteins to aiding the search for extra-terrestrial life by scanning through telescope data.Here's where the problem comes in.  How do we define a unit of work here?  How many black-hole spin measurements x are equivalent to a number of proteins folded y?What about when everybody in the world gets on-board, and suddenly we've measured the spin of every black-hole in the available data and there's no work left to do?Doing ""useful"" work with the tokens is a really cool concept in practice.

If they were all possible then it seems whoever made the Bitcoin algorithm would... Get the Bitcoin. Because it's impossible to know if something is solvable without knowing the solution,none
1-2-2-2-2,It's more like asking them to flip a coin and get tails N number of times. In such a way that it should take 10 minutes to solve it.

But it has multiple different solutions (a huge amount actually) and all future sudokus are based on the sudoku's that came before it. Depending which solution is found first, the next sudoku changes. It also changes based on the name of the person who solved it, the time that it was solved, etc etc. It takes a really, really long time to solve each sudoku. Its a really, really big sudoku. You would have to solve all sudokus of all sizes of all time to know the answer to each in advance. One that are trillions of squares large, trillions of times.

Sure, ""a single bitcoin causes this much environmental damage"" is misleading and over-simplification of applying the mean to a single source. But, take that single bitcoin and multiply it by all bitcoins, and it's a lot of damage.   It would be significantly lower if bitcoins were mined mostly in the Netherlands or something where they have more renewables.

Where I am, that number is ~385g CO2 per kWh.Also - renewables are not necessarily lower CO2 output as a category, things like biomass fuel generators are considered ""renewable"" in that biomass can be regenerated, but you are still burning a fuel that releases embodied carbon at a relatively high rate.  Nuclear is not considered renewable, in that spent fuel cannot be replaced, however it has a very low emissions rate per kWh.If a miner has his PC's running completely off of solar panels on his roof, for instance, he probably does have a significantly lower imposed cost on the environment per this calculation - where I live it's probably something like 85% lower.

Next, the energy used to ""mine"" is energy used to compete transactions. The amount of Bitcoin produced in this process is declining, by design, as the network grows.

The problem is that this is a cost center for an oil producer. It costs money to capture, the pipe work to do it is notoriously leaky and there's not really any incentive to do better (tragedy of the commons and all). If the production of NG were higher then piping it to the market would make sense, but that's almost certainly not commercially viable here.Being able to convert a waste product into hard cash, is going to provide a huge incentive for exxon to actually fucking capture it.

There are other L2s of course but LRC is partnered with GME so everyone here likes it more than the other L2s. You would want to buy it over Ethereum for investment purposes because the potential gains would be much higher, given the lesser current adoption and therefore a greater amount of future adoption, and the fact that it's much smaller cap so there's more potential in the market cap multiplying.

Coercion is seen as okay as long as it isn't physical in nature.The workers in the right-libertarian system are not serfs and are allowed to move, but the vast majority of them are nevertheless incapable of bettering their lot in life because they have no bargaining power.",against

They received their bitcoin back after paying off the loan and it matches the rise in volume. The reason why it always seem to appear like the wallet buys the dip is because it coincides with people putting their bitcoin up as collateral, causing it to end up in the wallet.

Bitcoin itself was inflated by overprinting of major currencies like the USD and Euro which gave people the disposable income at the time to buy and gamble on crypto. That 65k+ BTC high was fueled by an oversupply of fiat money in the real world and as soon as inflation caught up and reduced everyone's disposable real income, they pulled money out of crypto and stopped buying more crypto. That's why it has crashed. Until we see a stable rate of inflation and everyone has loads of disposable income again, crypto isn't going back up.

We're on the Isle of Man, a small island in the UK and have nearly 50 merchants from coffee shops to car dealerships accepting it. I use it often. We launched our contactless  only a few months ago and are already close to getting lightning integrated with a regular merchant POS system also running legacy Visa/Mastercard payment rails. Once the user and merchant experience becomes indistinguishable from the legacy system and merchants realize they can save 2% in fees it might not just be the developing world where this takes off.
