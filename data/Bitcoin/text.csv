1,"Bitcoin mining is just as bad for the environment as drilling for oil. Each coin mined in 2021 caused $11,314 of climate damage, adding to the total global damages that exceeded $12 billion between 2016 and 2021."
1-2,I still don’t understand how it is “mined”
1-2-1,"In the simplest terms, a computer uses math to complete a highly complex algorithm. This algorithm's answer is then fact checked by a group of other miners (this is why bitcoins take time before being available). If everyone agrees that the answer is correct, it's ""minted"" or verified by everyone (the blockchain) and the minted answer (bitcoin) is awarded to the computer that did the processing. The answer itself isn't worth anything, it's only used to provide the coin in the first place. As coins are mined, further complex algorithms are used to avoid devaluing the coin. This is why we went from using cpu to gpus (which are better at mathematical computations in this setting) to apus/ASICs (standalone bitmining systems that only do number crunching for these situations)."
1-2-1-1,"Almost, but not quite.  It doesn't complete a highly complex algorithm.  It completes a stupidly simple algorithm again and again with random inputs until it finds the input with the desired results.  It's mathematically equivalent to flipping a coin over and over again until you get 75 heads or tails in a row."
1-2-1-1-1,This. It's ramming inputs over and over and over again which is why it takes so much energy to do.
1-2-1-1-1-1,Do miners have to write their own algorithm that solves it? Or is that like open source and it’s really just about the power/energy being used.
1-2-1-1-1-1-1,"No, they use the SHA-256 algorithm (in the case of bitcoin) which has been around for decades. There's no other option, because thats whats in the protocol. It's so energy intensive because the field of numbers that *could* be correct is *stupidly* massive, and due to the algorithms pseudorandom output, there is no better way to find these needles than by picking out every piece of hay in the stack"
1-2-1-2,"""The answer isn't worth anything""Seems like a huge missed opportunity/ waste in this specific regard."
1-2-1-2-1,"Basically, the problem has to be difficult to find a solution, but very trivial to test the solution. Also there can't be any shortcuts or further optimization possible. And it has to be secure. Cryptographic hashing is basically the best answer there is to all 3 of these. Most others fail at one of these points."
1-2-1-2-1-1,this is a well written answer
1-2-1-2-1-1-1,"now that we've established how it's mined- which I don't fully (or even partially) understand, can anyone tell me *why* it's worth money? like, what backs up a bitcoin? it's not backed by gold or silver, right? how is it worth actual money? I'm sure I won't understand that either, but I really want to know"
1-2-1-2-1-1-1-1,"It’s just basic economics at this point. It’s given value by people who are interested in it. Everything around you has some sort of value based on what someone would pay for it. Not many people would pay that much for a rock in front of your house, but that nice TV on the wall is in more demand. Digital goods can have value too. Maybe you have a Steam account that has 500 games on it, there would someone willing to pay for it which gives it value. Same thing with bitcoin/crypto in general. Someone wants the particular crypto currency thus giving it its value."
1-2-1-2-1-1-1-3,"Why are money worth money?Money isn't backed up by gold anymore. It is backed up by other currencies that are also backed up by other currencies.So it is only an illusion of it being backed up by something tangible.So what gives cryptocurrencies value is the same thing that gives it to real money and that is demand.People believe Bitcoin has value, so it has value. Because they believe it has value they want to buy it. Them buying it raises it's price. Then it's just supply/demand that settles the final price."
1-2-1-2-1-1-1-4,"It's not backed by anything.The idea (and a lot of people struggle with this) is that bitcoin has properties which make it good to use as money (portable, verifiable, divisible, robust, fungible, scarce, censorship-resistance) and that therefore people will use it as money. And don't worry, this was quite a leap for everyone, in the early days of bitcoin it had zero value even to the people interested in bitcoin. It was kind of a chicken and egg thing who would accept it as money first when no one else did... but eventually someone made the leap and traded 10k bitcoin to someone else for a couple of pizzas and that in a way established the first price and a market eventually developed from there.But bitcoin is not backed by anything except its own ability to function."
1-2-1-2-1-2,But where do the problems come from?
1-2-1-2-1-2-1,"The goal is to find a number, such that when added to everything else in the block (the header, transactions, etc) and hashed, is below some arbitrary value, say, in the bottom 10% of possible values.The difficulty here is that any small change in an input produces a (pseudo)random change in the output. So the miner 'proves' their work by finding such a number, and every interested party can verify that this value works with only a single hash."
1-2-1-2-1-2-2,"Randomly generated in such a way that it's unclear what the answer is but once you have a correct answer it's easy to check that the answer is correct. Basically the whole blockchain(ie any computer currently mining) agree on a problem to solve(based on a pre determined algorithm) and then wait for the first person to come up with a solution, then if it's correct the group basically sends the computer that was successful that batch of coins"
1-2-1-2-2,"In this case only. There are exceptions, the main one that comes to mind is Gridcoin/GRC. They're provided via foldingathome or other programs, in which scientists and universities use public resources (ie. your home computer) to computate complex things like protein folding, galaxy simulation, blackhole simulations, etc.   They obviously aren't worth as much, but the concept is the same."
1-2-1-2-2-1,"The problem is that by giving the the work any practical utility, you take away the network's ability to control the distribution of new currency.A normal crypto like Bitcoin or pre-PoS Ethereum constantly adjusts the difficulty of the work to ensure that the payout rate averages to a predefined schedule. Without this capability, a coin risks becoming inflationary."
1-2-1-2-2-1-1,It's a good thing they have it on a fixed schedule so it doesn't fluctuate constantly.
1-2-1-2-2-2,Yeah well I feel like a fool for running SETI in 2011 instead of Bitcoin. It was a deliberate choice too.
1-2-1-2-2-2-1,Don't feel bad. You contributed to science in a manner only you could. That's still worth something in the end.
1-2-1-2-2-3,"Banano too, earned thru foldingathome started doing for money but now i just do it for science or whatever folding does"
1-2-1-2-2-3-1,"I never expected FAH to still be relevant so much farther down the line, but I guess that's because I never truly understood the scope of what it was. I remember when it was released as an app on the ps3 so you could fold on there and I would leave it on all the time having no idea what I was contributing."
1-2-1-2-2-3-2,"Yep, good old protein folding calculations. There's that and the SETI one. And GRC, as mentioned, and iExecRLC, as adjacent blockchain versions of the same idea"
1-2-1-2-2-4,I thought a part of the mining process was also verifying the transactions of bitcoin?
1-2-1-2-2-4-1,"No, verifying isn't done through mining. Any node can verify a block, but the privilege of suggesting a block is given to those who burn the most power."
1-2-1-2-3,Someone should run the numbers on how much Folding at Home could have benefitted from all the time and energy spent mining crypto.
1-2-1-2-3-1,Banano is a cryptocurrency which does basically this. I don't remember if it actually uses F@H or something similar though.It's a pretty unknown coin though
1-2-1-2-4,"The answer is worth the reward in BTC. That's their prize.This was an early consensus mechanism that builds capital investment from the miners, keeping them honest.The electricity/computational power is certainly a waste, hence more modern consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake.The issue is that consensus mechanisms are hard to create to be scalable and secure, which is why there are only a few. They need to be tried and tested."
1-2-1-2-4-1,"It's not ""worthless"" in the sense of not enriching the miner; it's worthless in the sense that there are a bajillion computationally-hard problems we could be putting the world's largest distributed supercomputer^* to work solving.&nbsp;^* ^The ^BTC ^mining ^network ^currently ^crushes ^the *^entire*  ^combined, ^by ^three *^orders ^of ^magnitude*."
1-2-1-2-5,"There's issues with trying to do it another way like you are describing (there are projects that do this.)For example GridCoin pays out crypto tokens for people that donate their PCs to doing scientific research through the BOINC project.With BOINC, you can contribute to a number of different projects. Everything from measuring black-hole spin to folding proteins to aiding the search for extra-terrestrial life by scanning through telescope data.Here's where the problem comes in.  How do we define a unit of work here?  How many black-hole spin measurements x are equivalent to a number of proteins folded y?What about when everybody in the world gets on-board, and suddenly we've measured the spin of every black-hole in the available data and there's no work left to do?Doing ""useful"" work with the tokens is a really cool concept in practice.  But to do so with a system that enables proper supply/demand for a currency?  Not really feasible."
1-2-1-3,"The other problem is rather than assigned transactions, you have first to solve, meaning multiple systems are working on the same transaction, and the first one to solve it gets the reward. This creates a lot of wasted energy, and larger mining systems out compete smaller mining systems. If it still works that way, I'm not sure if they changed it or not."
1-2-1-3-1,"Still works that way. Pretty much that's the thing that makes Proof-of-Work, well, work. Miners need to compete with each other over who can mine the block first, burning energy doing so and forcing malicious actors to burn greater amounts of energy to perform attacks. Doubt Bitcoin will pivot away from PoW, though, given how adamant they are about updating their protocol as little and as infrequently as possible."
1-2-1-4,But whose coins do they get? A small amount of the coins being transfered? Bitcoin is limited to 21 mil coins isn’t it?
1-2-1-4-1,"Yes but we haven't reached 21 million. There's more coins to be minted. Whenever an answer is found, ~~1~~ 6.25 Bitcoin is allocated to the address that found it. Since that has become effectively impossible for a single person to do, mining pools instead use many different miners to try different answers at the same time, and when ~~1~~ 6.25 Bitcoin is found it is automatically distributed to the miners relative to their contribution"
1-2-1-4-2,"New ones. New ones are made every time someone solves the algorithm. The ""reward"" is currently 6.25 bitcoins. The reward halves every so often. There will eventually be 21 million bitcoins. Currently there are less than that."
1-2-1-4-2-1,"But where do they come from? Like, is it an app? Where does the transaction come from? Does the program live on a server somewhere? The people who first set it up placed it somewhere, no?I still need more ELI5, mi scusi"
1-2-1-4-2-1-1,When a block is mined the miner is automatically awarded bitcoin. The code essentially confirms that the miner now has the necessary private keys to allow them to spend that amount of bitcoin.
1-2-1-5,"This isn’t entirely true, that process is correct however the “answer” as you put it is done to verify the validity of transactions so you don’t have people creating bitcoins out of then air (like if you were to cheat in a video game). It was designed so that outright hacking couldn’t just fabricate money like say hacking into a bank and editing the amounts in peoples accounts. Which while uncommon as cyber security has advanced, has happened in the past."
1-2-2,>I still don’t understand how it is “mined”It's like if idling your car 24/7 occasionally produced solved Sudoku puzzles that you could then exchange for heroin.
1-2-2-2,Who's making up the sudokus tho? That's my question. Are most of the sudokus actually unsolvable and it's kinda pure luck when you happen upon one that's actually possible? If they were all possible then it seems whoever made the Bitcoin algorithm would... Get the Bitcoin. Because it's impossible to know if something is solvable without knowing the solution
1-2-2-2-2,It's more like asking them to flip a coin and get tails N number of times. In such a way that it should take 10 minutes to solve it. If someone produces a solution under 10 minutes the difficulty increases and vice-versa. The protocol keeps track of time and adjusts the difficulty automatically.
1-2-2-2-3,pending transactions are the data that form the 'puzzle' as it were. When you find the solution to that exact data you append those transactions to bitcoins ledger as a 'block' and those transactions are considered settled.
1-2-2-2-4,"The sudoku puzzle is made up at the start. The first one was just.. ""created"" by someone. But it has multiple different solutions (a huge amount actually) and all future sudokus are based on the sudoku's that came before it. Depending which solution is found first, the next sudoku changes. It also changes based on the name of the person who solved it, the time that it was solved, etc etc. It takes a really, really long time to solve each sudoku. Its a really, really big sudoku. You would have to solve all sudokus of all sizes of all time to know the answer to each in advance. One that are trillions of squares large, trillions of times. So large that its computationally impossible to do.It is absolutely possible to know something is solvable without knowing the solution - its one of the cornerstones of modern cryptography, but I wont go into that."
1-2-2-3,"Thank you. This is what people mean when they say ELI5. Simple, short, to the point & doesn’t produce more questions."
1-2-2-3-1,"what are you on about, this doesn't explain whos creating the sudokus, why, and how solved sudokus become currency"
1-2-2-3-1-1,"When it's been explained thousands of times and info is readily available on the internet to look it up and see how things work, after a while you sorta just make jokes because the people asking don't really care, at least not enough to research it even just a little bit."
1-2-3,"To put it simply, miners are lucky number guessing machines. You guess the right lucky number first, you win a reward. Any other explanation is just trying to sugarcoat it and make it sound sexier than it is."
1-2-3-2,"I still don't understand where the value is created. When a machine guesses that lucky number and gets a coin that's worth money, where does that money come from?"
1-2-4,I understand how it's made.  I don't understand how that makes bitcoins worth anything.
1-2-4-2,"You can say this about mostly any currency we've every made. Paper money was a hard sell back in the day because ""why would this be worth anything."" It's worth something because a sufficiently large number of people have come to agreement that it's worth something."
1-2-4-3,It's worth something because it is guaranteed scarce.Your fiat money is worth nothing because unlimited amounts of it can be created at any time without any effort whatsoever.
1-3,How exactly do they measure climate damage in terms of USD?
1-3-1,They estimate economic damages by assigning a social cost to every ton of carbon emitted. I believe it's currently set to $50 a ton. It's a way of calculating future costs associated with carbon.
1-3-2,"Energy consumption (cost to produce energy), resources involved in producing components to make bitcoin and the wear those components take, ect...Although, it's dumb to use USD to show how bad climate damage is. Lots of climate damaging endeavors are economically lucrative, that doesn't mean it's a ""good"" thing.  Economically sound ≠ Environmently friendly. What's good for the economy is not always good for the people."
1-3-2-1,"> Energy consumption (cost to produce energy), resources involved in producing components to make bitcoin and the wear those components take, ect...Yeah, I don't see how that the cost of resources equates to ""climate damage""."
1-4,Wonder how they got 11k
1-4-1,Most likely by calculating energy consumption for mining another block. Should be pretty straightforward.
1-4-1-1,"Agreed, the amount of energy it takes to mine a block should be pretty straightforward.However, I’m curious if they took into account different energy sources (because different methods of generating energy have different environmental impacts) or if it was generalized in some way?"
1-4-1-1-1,"paper indicates it does account for it, like (total electricity of BTC) X (% green house gas generating electricity)"
1-4-1-1-1-1,"Hmm. So it’s: (total amount of electricity used by all Bitcoin mining) X (percentage of green gases electricity generation is responsible for)?To me that’s sort of a generalization and slightly discredits the articles claim of “a single bit coin mined causes *x* amount of money in climate damage”.Because that number would be different and probably significantly lower if someone had mined a Bitcoin using %100 renewable energy, right?"
1-4-1-1-1-1-1,"It's on average. On average, a country uses X amount of electricity with Y greenhouse sources and makes Z bitcoins. Sure, ""a single bitcoin causes this much environmental damage"" is misleading and over-simplification of applying the mean to a single source. But, take that single bitcoin and multiply it by all bitcoins, and it's a lot of damage.   It would be significantly lower if bitcoins were mined mostly in the Netherlands or something where they have more renewables. But most are mined in the US or China, and it would be hard to mostly mine them in countries that are renewable powered when the total energy usage of bitcoins is ""greater than the entire energy usage of Austria or Portugal""."
1-4-1-1-1-1-2,"The number might also be conservative. They're not accounting for the cost associated with the production of the video cards or systems that sustain the mining practice. It's not a perfect estimate, but an interesting datapoint all the same. We'll see how it changes now that Etherium is migrating to proof of stake.Edit: My bad ""bitcoin"" uses SHA256, which doesn't use GPUs. I think my comment about the environmental cost of manufacturing specialized hardware still stands... and I will continue to misspell the currency on principle."
1-4-1-1-1-1-3,how many areas have surpluss of renewable energy? All the renewable energy used on mining could be used for something else
1-4-1-1-1-1-3-1,"I’ve also heard of cases where miners will use excess energy from the grid and stop mining when energy demand goes up. Not necessarily related to renewable but seemingly using energy that otherwise won’t be used, if I understand correctly. Ideally we wouldn’t produce excess energy, but I guess that’s not super feasible."
1-4-1-1-1-1-5,"> Because that number would be different and probably significantly lower if someone had mined a Bitcoin using %100 renewable energy, right?The grams of CO2 per kWh of electricity generated does depend on the utility providing your electricity.  Where I am, that number is ~385g CO2 per kWh.Also - renewables are not necessarily lower CO2 output as a category, things like biomass fuel generators are considered ""renewable"" in that biomass can be regenerated, but you are still burning a fuel that releases embodied carbon at a relatively high rate.  Nuclear is not considered renewable, in that spent fuel cannot be replaced, however it has a very low emissions rate per kWh.If a miner has his PC's running completely off of solar panels on his roof, for instance, he probably does have a significantly lower imposed cost on the environment per this calculation - where I live it's probably something like 85% lower.  But still not zero."
1-4-1-1-1-2,"How much fossil fuels does the financial sector use for all of its buildings, employees commuting to work, flights, etc.....  You need to see what something replaces before you can make an assumption whether it is a net positive or negative."
1-4-1-1-1-2-1,Bitcoin has not replaced the global financial sector.
1-4-1-1-1-2-1-1,"But that is obviously the end goal of crypto currency, and why we are critically examining the cost and utility trade-off. It's easier to estimate the impact of something like Bitcoin mining because it's a discrete process with a predictable footprint. You do want to be able to compare it to something though, which is why the next question should be ""What is the cost of legacy financial systems that can be replaced by Bitcoin?"" Give me those two pieces of data and then I can tell you which we should use to optimize cost and utility. Or that's what I would do if I, a random redditor, was in charge of that decision."
1-4-1-1-1-2-4,But Bitcoin hasn't and won't ever replace the financialsystem.And afaik Bitcoin already uses more power than all other financialsystems in the world combined.
1-4-1-1-1-2-4-1,"Just for clarity, bitcoin consumes far less power than the global financial systems. It also consumes far less than gold."
1-4-1-1-1-2-4-2,The global financial system is defended by sovereign military which are the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world.Bitcoin doesn’t require trust or military coercion to protect or conduct transactions it requires math and probability.Bitcoin can exist on pen and paper
1-4-1-1-1-2-4-3,"Bitcoin consumes far less, but you still need to measure it against the alternative.  I'd argue the only place it is used often is international remittances.  So compare it to Western Union.Point is, you need to compare it against something in order to say it is bad.  It might still be bad, but metrics are required."
1-4-1-1-1-3,But what about the mining operations that use leaked methane? That's methane that would be leaked into the atmosphere.
1-4-1-1-1-4,"That’s inaccurate though as bitcoin green energy isn’t equal to total green energy used in the world. While bitcoin isn’t energy efficient, this study does have its flaws."
1-4-1-1-1-5,Most Bitcoin mines run on hydro power. It is NOT the “typical mix” of power sources.
1-4-1-1-2,"Most common is natural gas by almost 40% in the world, you can look at it as even if they used a different resource. That resource could’ve been used for something that ended up being powered by natural gas. Since it takes about 1,449kwh to make a single Bitcoin, it’s very difficult to use purely solar energy for their every energy need.1,449kwh source"
1-4-1-1-2-1,"I might just be a stickler for details, but I dislike that the article states “each coin mined cost *x* amount…” when power sources running the machines completing the mining can be dynamic and have varying environmental impacts."
1-4-1-1-2-1-1,"This study used  a global estimate of the location of BTC miners and the local electricity mix, and regional CO2e emission coefficients by generation type.They then used the *social cost of carbon* (SCC) which is an  within the domain (obviously open to criticism, but it's not my field so I didn't look into the literature)."
1-4-1-1-2-1-2,"This is also how much it cost to mine at the current complexity level. The article itself state it was exponentially lower before, so that number doesn't count for everything that was mined. And since bitcoin is 90% mined, it won't continue like that for long."
1-4-1-1-3,"It's not straight forward. Since Bitcoin mines can be anywhere, they tend to be where energy is the cheapest. Thus, it's common for Bitcoin mines to be setup to use waste energy such at dams or drilling sites. This throws the calculation for actual environmental impact off by an unknown amount. Next, the energy used to ""mine"" is energy used to compete transactions. The amount of Bitcoin produced in this process is declining, by design, as the network grows. So using the amount of Bitcoin mined is a really dumb metric. Additionally, Bitcoin's POW consensus algorithm isn't just used for Bitcoin. Layer 2 networks can use ""proof of transaction"" to leverage Bitcoin's concensus mechanism to support an entirely separate chain. So even trying to use numbers of transactions is erroneous."
1-4-1-2,"That’s pretty stupid though because afaik bitcoin isn’t mined for the regular electricity cost. A lot of mining happens using wasted energy (negative price) or some extremely cheap, otherwise miners would lose money. Clothes dryers, though, which only in US require more energy than bitcoin mining worldwide, do use regular electricity. Seems pretty biased and unscientific to be on science subreddit tbh."
1-4-1-3,it does not take 11k worth of energy to mine a block.
1-4-1-3-1,That is because the costs of the energy wasted do not include the negative externalities of the damage that fossil fuels do to the environment.
1-4-1-4,"I don't see how it can be as harmful as oil drilling, given that almost 100% of oil becomes co2, plastic or is spilled directly into the ocean. Bitcoin mining consumes a fraction of that oil, and therefore that can be considered environmental damage from mining, but It can never be more than that of oil unless mining were to somehow consume more oil than is produced?"
1-4-2,"And really, does extracting, processing, transporting, and burning 19k worth of oil not cause more than 11k in environmental damage? That seems ludicrous that it wouldn't."
1-4-3,Dollars doesn't feel like the right unit for measuring climate damage. I don't know what the right one is but dollars just seems wrong.
1-4-3-1,"Other than dollars, can you think of any other reason to oppose environmental protection? Why wouldn't someone want the earth and life as we know it to persist? Because it interferes with their current bottom line. Convince folks that they stand to lose more money by not saving the planet might be enough to convince them."
1-5,Giving a dollar value to climate damage is weird. Or am I weird?
1-5-1,"""It will take 100 trillion dollars to scrub our carbon from the air with an addition of 2 trillion dollars every year"" is easier to comprehend then ""climate change is bad"". And ""climate change will cause X trillion dollars of damage every year exponentially increasing"" also works."
1-5-2,Doesn't everything have a monetary value in our current world?
1-5-2-1,"Yes, because money is mainly just a measure and store of value. The environment (as it is) has value to humans, humans measure value in money, ergo, environment has monetary value."
1-5-3,"Theres a good amount of economics and legal research in determining the monetary value associated with the harms of climate change. My area of research is on the legal side, specifically the damages that someone can claim for harms exacerbated by climate change. A common example is a hypothetical Small Island Nation (SIN) suing countries like US, Canada, and China for emissions that have provoked sea-level rise. In theory the SIN should be able to sue larger nations for their contributions to climate change that resulted in the ocean swallowing their homelands. It's definitely a weird concept, but I think they make sense once they're understood as a solution to a different question. Given its weirdness, you can imagine the debates nitpicking dollar values."
1-5-4,"Not assigning a dollar value to environmental damage is how we got in this situation. ""Look, if we just destroy the world, it's free money with no downside!"""
2,Seized ASIC's from illegal Bitcoin mining operations that stole electricity (Malaysia)
2-1,There needs to be a subreddit for steamrolling stuff
2-1-1,/r/steamroller tried...
2-1-1-2,u/altoelder please unrestrict the subreddit
2-1-3,"there's a hydraulic press sub, and r/oddlysatisfying is pretty good"
2-2,What's an ASIC
2-2-1,Forgot the acronym but basically it’s a special built computer/system used to create crypto currency. The system can ONLY be used to mine/create cryptocurrency but at the cost of a LOT of electricity. I’ll fact check with google to get you the acronym’s meaning in a sec. Edit: acronym is: “application-specific integrated circuit”
2-2-1-1,"you are not wrong but ASICs in general are not only made to mine crypto currency, as you said ASIC stands for ""application-specific integrated circuit"", so any specialized IC is an ASIC, for example, a graphics card has a graphics ASIC, there are AI ASICs, network ASICs and etc. but the thing is, the only thing a crypto mining ASIC can do is, indeed, mine crypto"
2-2-1-1-1,Asics are much more broad than that even. Things like digital watches are Asics; most appliances older than a few years have Asics (they are now shifting towards just throwing a general purpose computer at everything since those cost ~$1 now and are much cheaper to develop).
2-2-1-1-3,"Graphics cards / GPUs are not ASICs! They are capable of doing any computing task, albeit not nearly as fast as computing graphics, the task for which they are most optimized. If a GPU was actually an ASIC, it wouldn't be possible to mine crypto on one."
2-2-1-2,So its basically terrible for the planet and useless?
2-2-1-2-1,"ASICs are application specific.These specific machines are highly tuned to do mostly meaningless calculations to compete in the bitcoin network for payouts. So basically yes.**HOWEVER** other ASICs, for other purposes might be very beneficial, as they are are usually much more power efficient than general purpose computers. Which is why they are used for bitcoin mining in the first place."
2-2-1-2-1-1,"I mean, even these specific mining ASICs still hash more efficiently than an equivalent GPU. So they use less energy/electricity/fossil fuels. Crypto mining is horrible for the environment and pointless in terms of material benefits. But if you’re gonna do it, might as well do it with an efficient machine."
2-2-1-2-1-1-1,"Also, ASIC miners use more power per die area. This means less silicon is needed than if you were to use CPUs or GPUs since mining profitability only evens out once the network consumes a certain amount of electricity."
2-2-1-2-2,"Mining ASICS, yes, but that’s just mining in general. ASICS are actually one of the most, if not most efficient way to mine, though that just means you can buy more of them to mine pretty much useless digital coins"
2-2-1-3,"Application Specific Integrated Circuit, as opposed to a general purpose processor or generic special purpose processors (e.g. Digital Signal Processors or Graphic(?) Processing Units)."
2-2-1-4,"ASICs are used typically because they consume LESS electricity than any other option (e.g. FPGA, Gen. Purpose Processor, GPU). At scale, ASICs are the most efficient solution, usually."
2-3,The comment section is way more intresting.
2-3-1,People left their brains at home today.
2-3-1-1,Yup I cringed hard at a comment that had clear misinformation saying Malaysia was a communist country. And reddit thinks we're better than facebook smh.
2-3-1-1-2,"Dawg? This country hates communism it’s rooted in their history, you gotta be one of the most illiterate bastards to call that country a communist country."
2-3-1-1-2-2,"""one of the most illiterate bastards"" ... a scary number of people think that socialism, communism and Nazism are exactly the same, just a matter of degree. And just the word anarchism will set them off. An afternoon with a book would clear it up, but they would just attack the 'commie author', and go on repeating what they have been trained to say."
2-3-1-1-2-2-1,"They almost just refer to literally anything that they think is negative as communist. I got into an argument with a co-worker a couple of years ago because he kept calling Nazi’s communist, and I had to correct it after he said it several times."
2-3-1-1-2-2-2,"Well sort of what happens when you have this weird superiourity complex the US has, interest in anything not US is kinda glossed over in schools. Also that strange pledge indoctrination."
2-3-1-1-4,">And reddit thinks we're better than facebook smh.We are, but not because we're good but because Facebook is that much worse."
2-3-1-1-4-1,I think you are underestimating the stupidity on this platform.
2-3-1-1-4-1-1,The fact that they are confusing that comment as which company and their politics is better (clearly to pander to the Facebook = bad group) when the commenter is clearly talking about the people on it is kind of par for the course here.
2-3-1-2,You can tell no one here has ever really mined crypto or looked into ASIC hardware because half the comments are about these still being useful for bitcoin (ignoring efficiency ratio against power consumption costs) and a ton of people just assuming these are normal computers that should go to the community. I hate what crypto has become but at least I understand what and how mining is to understand why this is an okay result.
2-3-1-2-1,"The whole concept of crypto currency and block chain technology is over my head to the tune of Mt. Everest. The concept fascinates me but everything I have tried to read up on the technology my brain turns into the equivalent of a deer caught in headlight. So with that said...> ignoring efficiency ratio against power consumption costsIs this about the idea that the number of bit coins, that have already been mined, is so high that that these machines will 'spend more energy mining what they mine' than 'the worth of what they mine compared to the cost of the energy'?>just assuming these are normal computers that should go to the community.Is this becuae these 'towers' only have what is necessary to mine bitcoin and none of the 'bells and whistles' needed to operate a computer, like regular operating system, video/sound cards, and other parts?"
2-3-1-2-1-1,"An ASIC is a purpose built computer that will *only* be useful for mining.  In fact, ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit.  They're even specific down to the coins they can mine, meaning these aren't just wasting electricity they're also wasting tech manufacturing because these are useless outside mining"
2-3-1-2-1-1-1,So to reuse anything from this it would have to go to a recycling facility?
2-3-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Pretty much, and even then the ability to recycle electronics is a bit...overstated: While its entirely possible to make sure a facility doing that process isn't releasing toxic smoke or runoff, doing it the safe way costs more money, so companies have an incentive to try and move that industry to countries with few or poorly-enforced laws about pollution."
2-3-1-4,Gotta make themselves feel better somehow
2-3-3,They’re way too busy investing in crypto
2-4,Am I the only one mad that Mr. steamroller just drove through the middle like a chaotic maniac instead of neatly starting a line along one side?!?
2-4-1,Far right side of the video had already been crushed this must be the 2nd pass going after the left side now... was bothering me too before I noticed
2-5,"The more I see about crypto, the less I understand."
2-5-1,"""It looks like a pyramid scheme""""It isn't a pyramid scheme""When to get in and when to get out."
2-5-1-1,"""What's it good for?""""Look at all of the investment""""Can you name a groundbreaking use case?""""Lol, you are so ignorant. Look at all of the investment.""""Can you name a groundbreaking use case?""""Lol"""
2-5-1-1-1,Buying mail order drugs online.
2-5-1-1-1-3,Know where I can buy one of these asics?
2-5-1-1-1-3-2,"It’s not worth buying an asic. Better as an individual to stake in a staking pool. If you’ve got money to buy thousands of them then it would  be worth it (if you can fund the electricity long enough to mine anything), but a single asic is about as effective as trying to move a mountain with a shovel."
2-5-1-1-1-3-2-1,Bitcoin is not proof of stake though. ETH is going there “soon.”
2-5-1-1-2,"When you point out it's a bad investment, people say it's not an investment, it's a currency.When you point out it's a bad currency, they say it's not a currency, it's an investment."
2-5-1-1-2-1,"It’s almost like none of that matters. The only thing they care about is, line goes up.I really hope bitcoin crashes and takes all other idiotic cryptocurrencies with them because they’re extremely wasteful."
2-5-1-1-4,"Or the final excuse beyond excuses: ""but number goes up!"""
2-5-1-1-5,"The groundbreaking use-case is making money by selling them to someone for a higher price than you bought them. No one wants crypto for any other reason (excluding fringe use-cases like funding criminal activity). That's why it's critical to constantly be bringing in new 'investors' who're less educated to create a steady stream of people to sell bitcoins to. There's zero intrinsic value or utility to foster a stable market of people who will always buy coins regardless of the price. That's why the price always increases instead of stabilising. The bubble will pop eventually, it'll be a massive destruction of wealth.The price volatility makes it awful as a form of currency. Why would you give your cyrpto for X service or product when you potentially incur a massive opportunity cost by not holding onto cyrpto for longer?"
2-5-1-2,"It's a perpetual Ponzi scheme. It can collapse over and over, but there's no business to go under and no orchestrator to go to jail."
2-5-1-2-1,"It’s also  worth money because people say it is like normal money is… we say it’s worth something because others say it is….1 bitcoin like 4 years ago was worth 4,000$ and like last year was 60,000$..  It’s literally the combined of the stock market and a Ponzi scheme"
2-5-1-2-1-1,"Except it has little value as an actual currency when it's so hyper deflationary, so it's velocity will actually be terrible and no one will want to trade it when they can make money holding it."
2-5-1-2-2,So its just like all of American capitalism?
2-5-1-2-4,"How should “crypto” be a ponzi scheme?There are more than 6.000 different crypto currencies with hundreds of thousands of different developers, explaining exactly how it works. All are made by different individuals, with different aims, an insane use case and much potential.Do you think everyone working with/on crypto joined a secret agreement to join the ponzi scheme? Because this is would be the only way which would make crypto a ponziEDIT: And of course there are businesses to go to jail to. Do you think they are all anonymous? No.  Thousands of known, perfectly transparent businesses documenting what they do more precisely than probably 95% of other businesses"
2-5-1-2-4-1,"> MLM businesses can't be a scam because there's so many of them, there's no way they could be that organised.This is what you sound like."
2-5-1-2-4-1-2,"Could you reference the sentence where I sounded like that, or explain why you think I could think so I can’t really seem to find it"
2-5-1-2-4-1-2-1,> Do you think everyone working with/on crypto joined a secret agreement to join the ponzi scheme? Because this is would be the only way which would make crypto a ponziThe implication being that the implementation is the Ponzi scheme and not the system they are building on top of.
2-5-1-2-4-2,"Each coin is an individual ponzi scheme, and yes, ponzi schemes are popular enough that thousands of people want to start them."
2-5-1-2-4-2-1,"Ok, so you think that every developer who creates a crypto currency is just doing it to create a ponzi scheme?What about just doing 5 minutes of research before writing about something you think you would know about, here a little help: This is actually the first result from the search: “Is crypto a pyramid scheme?” Read as much as you want, and I d suggest this to any reader of this comment before votingsome more resources for you: (Of course I would recommend you to do your own research and find your own resources if you think that the one I provide are biased)"
2-5-1-2-4-2-1-1,">Ok, so you think that every developer who creates a crypto currency is just doing it to create a ponzi scheme?No no no. Cumcoin and Moonrocketcoin are totally made for ethical reasons."
2-5-1-2-4-2-2,"Each coin is definitely not a Ponzi scheme, is crypto early in adaption? Yes, and that’s alright not everyone will agree with it. Take a little time to research coins like Ethereum which will be upgrading to proof of stake this summer to prevent a waste of energy from typical mining. There’s 100s of other coins that each do different things. Obviously some of them will fail but just because you don’t understand something/ take the time to research it doesn’t mean it’s a Ponzi scheme."
2-5-1-2-4-2-2-1,"Sadly good arguments and an opinion are not liked here. People who think “Crypto is bad and a scam” obviously never did any research on this very complex topic, but still feel like sharing their thoughts and putting them as facts"
2-5-1-2-5,Blockchain needs a new term to explain how it is scamming people.
2-5-1-3,It is a pyramid scheme though
2-5-1-3-1,It's more of a cone
2-5-1-3-1-1,Bitcone
2-5-1-4,"> ""It isn't a pyramid scheme""In every pyramid scheme, the participants are always convinced its not a pyramid scheme."
2-5-2,"While I do not understand the intricacies of how crypto works, I do think I am correct when I summarize it as ""greed"" + ""fomo"" = bubble soon to go POP."
2-5-2-1,I haven't met a single person whose ever talked about it like a currency. Just about about selling it (for US dollars) when it moons or whatever.
2-5-2-1-3,"Because performing transactions is vastly more energy intensive and slower than in current banking systems with the added benefit that now, if you ever get de-anonymized due to your own carelessness or a leak on one of the various service providers you'll use, everyone can know your transaction history. It's.... a thing."
2-5-2-1-5,"Fyi most crypto isn't intended for use as a currency. Bitcoin is, although you could argue it works even better as a store of value than as a currency. The vast majority of cryptos have nothing to do with currency at all. This is the biggest misconception with the mainstream atm and once they figure this out crypto will explode."
2-5-2-1-5-1,"The store of value is a new narrative after it became obvious that due to price volatility, bitcoin was completely unsuitable as a currency. We’re not all such goldfish that we forget why the “asset” has “coin” in the name. Well, you better start spinning a new narrative because it’s clear that bitcoin isn’t a great store of value either."
2-5-2-1-5-1-2,Price volatility is short term. If there was widespread adoption then volatility would settle. Do you disagree with this?              How is it clear bitcoin isn't a good (long term) store of value? What has it beat?
2-5-2-1-5-1-2-1,"What has it beat? Something with sound regulation, insurance, safety against losing a usb key or forgetting a token, privacy, and a host of other features? Something backed by a government elected democratically?Turns out, as much as you might hate on the government, it’s still better than unelected plutocrats running the show. Or are we going to ignore all the corruption and insider trading at coinbase and binance also"
2-5-2-5,The same ignorance people have been spouting since btc was worth less than a dollar each lol
2-5-2-5-1,"It was true then and it's true now. The size of the scam doesn't prove it isn't a scam, it just proves that unregulated markets of speculative ""investment opportunities"" are still successful even in an era of unprecedented access to information.The greed of the precariously middle class dwarfs any sense. At least the finance guys pumping crypto have the excuse of being exiled from trading regulated securities."
2-5-2-5-1-1,"Look not gonna bother trying to convince you otherwise because you’re clearly ignorant about the crypto market at large and don’t care to educate yourself, that’s fine. It’ll be a long time before people like you eventually die out and become a relic of the past. But the reality is that it’s growing massively over time and isn’t going away."
2-5-2-5-1-1-2,"Even if you did have any idea how many people have aged into their twilight years thinking they saw the future no one else could, you would still be talking like this in reddit threads because being invested in crypto currency provides you a direct financial incentive to convince people it's legitimate.Whether or not you actually believe what you say doesn't matter to me and these threads are so repetitive it's not even fun to argue about it beyond a few comments deep."
2-5-2-5-1-1-2-1,"Nope don’t care in the slightest about convincing anyone to invest in anything.. just have a natural habit of needing to respond to stupid comments I see on the internet, about any topic I happen to have knowledge aboutBut I agree there’s nothing fun about and I typically just let it go because it’s a waste of time"
2-5-2-5-2,"*""It can't be a Ponzi scheme. Just looks at these great returns!""*Lol"
2-5-2-5-2-2,"Nope. You’re missing the point, I’m saying since the beginning of its existence people have said the same shit every year and yet remain wrong to this day. Hell I was one of the nay sayers not long ago too before I really understood what was going on."
2-5-2-5-2-2-1,"No, I'm really not missing the point. Insisting that it's only ever gone up isn't the knockout argument for it being a good investment that you think it is. But whatever, bro. Do what your heart tells you."
2-5-2-5-2-2-1-2,"So tell me, what is gold worth? Why is it worth something? It's not scarce as it's abundant on earth. It's limited artificially to keep the price up. Would you call gold a scam? I would say it is.Yet the only thing that keeps gold from being a scam is because some dude wrote a piece of paper that says so."
2-5-2-5-3,"Sub-prime market also took about two decades to pop and people saying so, were reacted to the same as you react. I hope you atleast base your knowledge on academical sources, not some internet voodoo bullshit."
2-5-3,It's MLM for douche-bros
2-5-4,"It was a noble idea that turned into a scam, some people got rich off it. Its mostly useless and hurts both environment and people who lose to scams, pump and dump market control and hackers."

3-1,Good thing I invested heavily in Kohl's Cash.
3-1-1,Dude that stuff is amazing. I saved $156 on a pair of jeans at Kohls the other day. The receipt told me so
3-1-1-1,"I call it ""Kohl's math"". You could buy a pack of gum from there and somehow ""save"" $53.87. And that was before this runaway inflation we're seeing."
3-1-1-2,This anonymous anecdote is enough to get me to heavily invest in Kohls Cash.

3-1-1-3,"This reminds me of JCPenney. The CEO didn’t want to do deceptive sales and pricing so he just put the real price on their clothes instead of putting $28 crossing it out and putting $14 (although it had never been priced at $28, that kind of deception) he just sold it for $14. They almost went bankrupt and they got rid of him and the next guy started back with the deceptive pricing and fake sales and profits soared. Apparently people love thinking they are getting a deal even if they are not as opposed to just straight up pricing cause THAT is when they believe they are being deceived. It’s incredible. My facts may be off but that is the gist of the story"

3-1-1-3-4,"In the 1990's I worked in an independent video store.We would buy and sell new and used video tapes and DVD's (as well as our rental business).If we put used stuff on the shelf for sale for a dollar or two, sometimes it wouldn't move.  But if we put a $5 price on it, it would sell.  It would really fly off the shelves if we kept the $5 price tag on and then offered a ""3 for 6"" sale or something, even though that was the price we would have given it anyway...."
3-1-1-3-4-1,"My grandfather owned a men's clothing store in the 1950s. Every year, just before Father's Day the downtown merchants would have a sidewalk sale. Granddad put various wares on display including one rack of $1 ties and another rack of $3 ties. No one wanted to look like a cheapskate by purchasing a $1 tie for their dad, so that rack would empty out quickly at which point Granddad would move ties from the $1 rack to the $3 rack."

3-1-3-1,You get a 15% coupon if you drop off Amazon returns at a Kohls. The interesting part is that you can stack it with Kohls cash. During the weeks before Black Friday they will put a lot of inventory on clearance. I used to raid the watches and resell them on eBay. You can easily 5x your money.
3-1-3-1-1,Ah fuck. Is this still viable? I'm about to be a semi-broke college student and that sounds straightforward.
3-1-3-1-1-1,"I haven’t tried lately but here’s an example of a good find. The Amazon coupon is actually 20%, not 15."
3-1-3-1-1-1-2,Does that say 80% off for clearance???
3-1-3-1-1-1-2-1,"Sometimes stores have percent off markdowns that get progressively deeper the longer the product stays unsold. It's how I was able to buy hoodies and shirts for less than 5 bucks, but I've never seen something this extreme for a high price item like a watch."
3-1-3-1-1-2,It's called retail arbitrage and the risk can be high on ecommerce platforms like ebay / amazon where people can easily file returns. Nothing wrong with returning items but it can easily fuck you if you put all your eggs in one basket.
3-1-3-1-2,I did a return and they gave me a $5 coupon that I could use right away. Bough 3 candy bars and nothing else.

The catch is that neither type of discount applies to products from ""premium brands"" like Nike or Dyson, licensed sports apparel, or select cosmetics.However, Kohls cash works on everything in the store, so if you want something that's ineligible for discounts, it's better to come back for it in a few days when whatever kohl's cash you earned activates.They'll also honor Kohl's cash after it expires (the physical coupon only). It was up to a week when I quit, but I think it's only 2 or 3 days, now.Source: Former dept lead."

3-4-1-4,You forget that a lot of external investment is flowing into the country because of the decision to adopt Bitcoin as a currency. Especially due to their Bitcoin bond.
3-4-1-5,"As he stated, he hasn’t lost anything, because they haven’t sold any. How is this hard to understand?"
3-4-1-5-1,"Your wealth includes assets.  If your total worth goes down with house and vehicle value, it sure as hell goes down with crypto"
3-4-1-5-2,You cannot be fucking serious with this comment. Did you pass high school?
3-4-1-5-2-1,Go on bitcoin or crypto currency subreddits. They're all saying this exact same thing no joke
3-4-1-5-2-1-1,Funny how the opposite isn't true when it goes up.
3-4-1-5-2-1-1-1,No one denies your worth in that moment goes up if your assets do.Problem is if you always hold and never sell then you have nothing
3-4-1-5-2-1-1-2,Yeah fact is it doesn't matter when you get margin-called or can't meet collateral for your loans like Celsius or MSTR.
3-4-1-5-3,"Bitcoin is a currency, not an investment. If the value of it goes down you lose money even if you don't sell because it's literally a currency"
3-4-1-5-3-1,That's how you know even crypto bros don't view crypto as functioning currency. The concept of how much *stuff* bitcoin translates to (and that amount of stuff being less) doesn't even register.Their framing on its value only ever treats it like fractional stock shares.
3-4-1-5-5,"Thats like saying your $15 million house is on fire, but dont worry, you havent lost any money because you havent sold it yet."
3-5,"""This is good for bitcoin"""
3-5-1,"""Buy the dip!"""
3-5-1-1,Aaaaaand.... it's gone.  South Park
3-5-1-1-1,Sorry yeah that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have bitcoin in their wallet
3-5-1-1-4,Matt Damon took all my money.
3-5-2,"This is the most confusing part of it for me.  I work with a crypto enthusiast, and the most suspect aspect of the whole affair is that *everything* is good news.  Crypto is stable?  Proof of concept.  Crypto is skyrocketing?  Profits.  Crypto is crashing?  Time to buy.  I'm not sure I trust a game with no ""lose"" state."
3-5-2-1,It's basically MLM now
3-5-2-1-1,Always has been.
3-5-2-2,">I'm not sure I trust a game with no ""lose"" state.Congratulations you just voiced literally the single most important heuristic to determining if something is bullshit pseudoscience or something you can evaluate further. That's like, step 1 in Carl Sagan's Demon-Haunted World. ""Can this be disproved or enter a fail state?"" If not, it's not science and you should be highly skeptical of it."
3-5-2-3,"I mean, all those things *are* positives. They are *selected positives* that disregard the negatives though. It’s not that there are no downsides (though I don’t know what your co-worker believes, he could just be completely delusional), but each state represents a different set of positives and negatives. Switch out the word “crypto” for “the housing market” and each of those statements still apply.So long as they don’t believe that they can’t lose, they don’t have a terrible outlook on it. Better that than invest thinking it’ll go up forever, then cash out in a panic when your portfolio drops 90% and repeat the same mistake the next time the market skyrockets."
3-5-2-4,"Crypto literally only has value if people believe it does. No doubt can ever slip in, it’s powered by delusion."
3-5-2-4-1,Isn't that how money works tho?
3-5-2-4-1-1,"No. Countries have the option of backing and protecting their money with soft power and if it comes to it state violence. The “full faith and credit” of the US is a euphemism for the military, for example."
3-5-2-4-1-1-1,Well you've got me there
3-5-3,I'm still trying to understand the premise of using something so insanely volatile as currency.  The whole point of currency is as a uniform measure of exchange.  I don't get it.  I used to get it.  I lost it.
3-5-3-1,"Thing is no one uses it as currency unless you're buying drugs on the dark Web. Like who can actually go around paying for goods, services or property with bitcoin. There might be some cases where that has happened but its so far from the norm.It's just gambling (or a ponzi scheme) not an actual currency."
3-5-3-2,Because most of them don’t actually intend to use it as a currency. Thats the shit they tell people to try and make it sound legit.
3-5-3-3,"Nothing like waking to the store with $20, and it’s now $12 when you arrive eh"
3-5-4,A store of Devalue!

4,"The European Central Bank says bitcoin is on ‘road to irrelevance’ amid crypto collapse - “Since bitcoin appears to be neither suitable as a payment system nor as a form of investment, it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimised.”"
4-2,Pretty sure XMR isn't going anywhere as long as drugs are illegal though.
4-2-1,Yes. I can't buy XMR in my country. So I buy Litecoin and exchange it on chain to XMR lol
4-2-1-1,"But if you used any exchanges that require ID and you've provided real ID, your XMR is no longer anonymous.Edit: appreciate the responses! Didn't know all this and pretty much left the crypto space years ago!"
4-2-1-1-1,"Right but there's always a way of setting up an annonymous xmr wallet and transfering your coins there. The second it gets transferred anyone watching will have no idea who it went to unless that wallet was registered with an ID through a third party (i.e. on an exchange that requires ID). So you can buy as much xmr as you want with your name attached, as long as you transfer it to a different wallet that doesn't have your name attached before purchasing illegal things."
4-2-1-1-1-1,Well yes but wouldn't the transfer to the other wallet multiple times be a flag?
4-2-1-1-1-1-2,Nope. The his is why the IRS has a million dollar bounty on defeating that and try to track those transactions.
4-2-1-1-1-2,"Hey guys, this guy clearly purchased 500 coins and then they were transferred immediately to this other account labelled clearly not a drug buyer. Then it bought drugs... I cant imagine who this actually is, definitely not. Do you think it might be the person who bought the coins and then transferred them to an account that bought the very drugs that they ended up in possession of?"
4-2-1-1-1-3,"Steve sends money to X.   No one else sends money to X.  X buys drugs.Yes, that surely is a complex enough system to foil the feds."
4-2-1-1-1-3-1,"Your oversimplification implies the feds are just rolling over everyone but they aren't, so what gives?"
4-2-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Limited budget means you go after the big fish. No one cares if billy-joe is buying small amounts of crack in backwoods alabama.  Certainly no one cares if he's paying in cash, bitcoin, or bj's."
4-2-1-1-1-3-2,"Yeah, I don't see how this is hard to trace. You can see where the money goes, the transaction from your original account to your second account is public. Unless this currency works in a way I don't understand."
4-2-1-1-1-4,"""hm I wonder who this xmr wallet that get regular transfers from the same account belongs to, let's go visit that one person randomly"""
4-2-1-1-1-4-1,"You can't see that info though, that's the whole point of xmr. The wallet you transfer to is fully hidden. If you did it repeatedly it would actually look like different accounts on the ledger. Even if it did look like the same account, there would be no way to know who owns the annoynmous account, or which account it receives transfers from. If you can crack the xmr encryption there's 250mil waiting for you."
4-2-1-1-1-4-2,Owning (or sending) xmr is no more grounds for a search warrant than owning and spending physical cash the government can't track.
4-2-1-1-1-5,"FYI - this isn’t secure.  The “anonymous “ XMR wallet in the first step is trackable in the way it’s usually implemented.  Several other steps in the usual process there are iffy as well.  None of this is ever fully secure, the only reason everyone isn’t busted is that the authorities use it to continue to watch for the whales and truly dangerous transactions."
4-2-1-1-2,I also want to mention because the others didn't but with litecoin you can use MWEB to send a litecoin transaction privately to another account. So you can break the chain between your exchange and monero before even leaving the litecoin network.
4-2-1-1-3,Localmonero - cash by mail
4-2-1-1-4,"Yeah but depending on the country, they don’t give a shit about small fish buying for personal use. Probably some luck involved, but I was buying a ball of blow a week, a half o of weed, and ketamine/acid depending on the funds with btc transferred from Coinbase from 2015-2020. Just buy domestic and don’t buy weight. Also don’t do this but it was fun as shit"
4-2-2,As long as anything is illegal really
4-2-3,"Man, I dunno, buying drugs from dark markets are even more stressful than buying drugs IRL.There is always a risk of markets getting busted, currencies getting devaluated overnight, sellers being scammers, wallets getting stolen, and the worst part, authorities know damn well what's going on so there is an additional risk of getting your stuff confiscated, or police trying to lure you etc.I find the conventional method of purchasing illicit substances a much more simple method honestly."
4-2-3-1,My weed guy takes paypal and delivers to my house.
4-2-3-1-4,"Since weed in Thailand is now pseudo-legal I'm swamped with weed ads on facebook. Can order online, fast delivery pay with whatever payment methods. And that's on top of the 7 weed shops in my neighbourhood."
4-2-3-2,"Buying irl is crazy expensive though. Where I live 1 tab of lsd will be £10, and god knows what the actual dosage on it is, if it even is lsd in the first place.Darkweb is much more reliable and cheaper for me. I can order 25 tabs for £60 from a reliable seller."
4-2-3-3,"Once you get familiar with how the markets work it's a lot easier. My first time was stressful af, and I spent a solid 5 hours making sure I did everything right. Once you figure out which vendors you can trust, which markets are solid and how to go through the steps, it's pretty easy. And darknet is way more reliable than most dealers, at least in my experience, and also a lot cheaper."
4-2-3-3-1,Where'd you learn how to do that? Is there like a darknet drugs for dummies guide? Do they take doge haha
4-2-3-3-1-1,It's called the darknet bible
4-2-3-3-1-1-1,DNB can’t tell me which fake adderall vendor isn’t meth :(
4-2-3-3-1-1-1-1,"That just takes buying small amounts first, and making sure to test everything you buy. Which you should be doing already, regardless of where you buy drugs from."
4-2-3-4,"If you're a casual buyer who only buy in small quantity for personal use, you have 0% chance of getting caught. People at risk are vendors and people that buy in bulk, but even then, with PGP nobody is really at risk.Direct pay is usually the recommended choice nowadays, so you have no currency idling on the market wallet and don't lose anything if it get busted. In my opinion, buying IRL is 100x more risky and stressful. Black markets are taking over because people are tired of their plug giving them pills THEY even themself have no idea what's in it. If a vendor is dodgy on the market, he will get banned pretty much instantly and his reputation will tank. Reputation is basically the only thing that matters for vendors, so they usually make sure nothing go wrong ever. Scam select is the only thing i can agree on,it sucks."
4-2-3-4-1,"Nah, at least in my country small-time customers have been fucked over when dealers got busted and handed over the addresses of all their customers. Thats really the weak point; Online security might very well be almost irrelevant for occasional buyers, but you need an anonymous drop, or you’re just asking for trouble."
4-2-3-4-1-1,"They hand over your address, then what? When the police knock on your door, just deny knowing anything about it. There is zero proof the dealer didn't make it up to get a lighter sentence."
4-2-3-5,A quote that comes to mind is that literally every darknet marketplace is intended to be an exit scam (Brett Johnson who used to run one thinks this). If enough money is stored on the sites they intend to shut down and just leave.
4-2-3-5-1,"Sure but you gotta be extremely unlucky to get impacted by it. Can happen for sure but still, pretty rare. I had like 3 orders go through as the markets were exit scamming. The first time I contacted the seller on another market and the 2 other times the sellers received the orders in time and had already sent the parcels.          It's shit for sellers though. Also, it goes without saying but just don't leave money on market wallets."
4-2-3-5-2,"Not all marketplaces have wallets anymore. So no money stored to be exitscammed. Independent escrow for each sale that only seller can finalize. Additionally several  markets come to mind that didn't exit scam before shutting down such as agora, cgmc and dream."
4-2-4,based department
4-2-5,"XMR is the king of the dark web, but it should also be the king of P2P transactions between all regular users. Privacy is for everyone and not just for ""criminals""."
4-3,ITT: people who have no idea what a bank actually does talking about how crypto is a major threat to banks.
4-3-1,Lol it was the same on the crypto sub. They were all taking this as a sign to BUY BUY BUY
4-4,"Dammit, there goes that €40 invested! There was a time it was €400 though! That was a good day!"
4-4-1,"I turned $30 into $400 with Dogecoin. I thought I was just throwing $30 away but then I I sold at $400 and bought into the coin base IPO. So instead of throwing $30 away, I threw away $400! Woohoo! Actually, just cheeked, if I sold my CB stock  today I’d have $49 so I guess I made $19 overall."
4-4-1-1,That is a decent return. I bet you are kicking yourself for not throwing down 3 million.
4-4-1-1-1,He's not crazy he probably put that 3 million in sTaBleCoiNs
4-4-1-1-1-1,"""Unrugpullable, untiltable, safe, secure, backed up and endorsed by Lil Pump"" *crashes after 3 months*"
4-4-1-1-2,If he put in 3 million everyone else would probably sell and he'd still lose.
4-4-1-2,CB is one of the few exchanges that are actually legitimate  (Sell for tax and then buy back ) In a year you'll be reminded and maybe be surprised. Or lose 49 bucks
4-4-1-3,I bought a digital batman NFT and turned $89 into $2800... Then I realised how crazy that was and walked away. I'm certain people made bank on NFTs but so many people must have lost out.
4-4-2,"Yeah, I put $100 towards it. It's now about $10. Good thing it was only $100 as I was tempted to put around $1000 at the time.Going to invest in something that's a lot less risky and much more stable.EDIT: Since I've got a few questions about this. This is with Dogecoin. I put in $100 and now have slightly more than $16."
4-4-2-1,I put in about $1000 and took out about $1000 when it started plummeting. I still have $200 or so left. Just leaving that there because gambling though. I think this counts as success
4-4-2-1-1,"Since you broke even, everything else is profit, don’t see how this can be interpret as anything other than success, even if a minor one"
4-4-2-1-1-1,20% profit too is actually a crazy good return on any normal standards too
4-4-2-3,"Threw in about $600 i to crypto.  I may never recover the money, but the roller coaster ride may equal money spent in about 6 years time."
4-4-2-4,"Just invest 70% domestic and 30% foreign vanguard ETFs.Like voo, vxus, etc.  Just have it follow the market and you can't lose long term."
4-4-2-4-1,"Agree with this guy or gal. ETFs are the way to go, minimal (long term) risk, just set it and forget it"
4-4-3,They say this every 3-4 years.
4-4-4,"I bought 0.1 bitcoin at £150 each years ago. I'm not selling, as far as I'm concerned it's really interesting technology that's not going away."
4-4-4-1,"Yeah, I’ll leave the money where it is. Tbh, I just didn’t want to be that guy in 20 years that regrets not investing in crypto. We’ll see how things go, this hasn’t been the 1st time it collapsed and it won’t be the last"
4-4-4-1-1,"If nothing else, in 20 years it'll be an interesting story to tell. Maybe we can show everyone our balance at parties."
4-5,"I know people who got into Bitcoin very early on, including a couple of people who got it when a normal person could mine Bitcoin for free.You know what they’ve all got in common? They pretty much all lost it to some kind of scam, hack or dodgy exchange. Or in the case of my friends who got in *really* early and cheap, because they lost their keys or got rid of the computer which they needed to access their coins.On the other hand, I’ve got friends who’ve got full access to the coins they bought more recently. They’re the ones who are annoyed that it’s fallen by 60% or more since they “invested” in Bitcoin!"
4-5-1,"I remember mining about 50000 dogecoins when it first released in a night, stored it in my computer, and then promptly forgot about it. It's gone now. Sad!"
4-5-2,I got into Bitcoin back around 2010. Crazy to think I spent hundreds of thousands dollars on a 10 strip of acid. It was good acid though.
4-5-3,"Yep. I was literally given 10 bitcoins for free really early on. They were worth less than £1 at that point. I know I put them on a drive and set up a wallet and made an encryption key. But. It was a long time ago and by the time I thought to look into it again I knew I’d drive myself mad if I even attempted to retrieve them. I still don’t see “pay with BTC” in any store. Online or in physical stores to this day. I understand the need for decentralized currency, but it’s never going to be mainstream and it’s always going to seem like a scam to most people."
4-5-4,"I mined 12 btc on my CPU very early on and didn't think twice about it when I formatted my drive to do a fresh os install. No biggie, it was barely enough to order a pizza at the time."
4-5-5,"Typical human fallacies at work. People want to believe that what happened _then_ is related to what they are doing _now_. They convince themselves that because some digital currency is worth ten thousand times what it was worth 10 years ago that somehow that is relevant to them buying some _now_.The people doing this would be doing the exact same thing on the stock market if not for crypto, or probably are as well, and/or playing their luck at the casino.They're making bad decisions based on emotion, not knowledge and fact.At one point I had a drive with a few dozen bitcoin on it I mined myself. Long gone now. I don't dwell on missing out on hitting the bitcoin jackpot because that is pure emotion based on ZERO fact or logic.My bitcoin I mined back then was just as likely to make me a millionaire as buying into crypto today is. IE: Not very likely and a pretty bad gamble."
4-5-5-1,"I remember the first time I heard about crypto it was something like $10 a coin and it was a story about someone who had either bought a bunch for pennies or mined some. Enough that they cashed out and bought a condo or whatever (not millions, I think they had about $300k worth) and I remember thinking *damn I already missed the boat, no point investing in it now*. Hindsight is always 20/20 and I probably would have sold way too early anyway."
4-5-5-1-1,"I mined Bitcoin back when it was possible and you  could get full Bitcoins just casually mining with your daily rig. I had like 7 and it was worth nothing back then, so I eventually upgraded and threw away that HDD with the wallet in it.On the one side damn, I lost a ton of money, but on the other side I would have ***absolutely*** sold at $100, $300, and even if not those, *definitely* at $1000. I would have never held til the peak or anything like that so it doesn't matter.The biggest ""loss"" is that I never got into Bitcoin and other crypto so maybe there's some opportunity loss there, but the 7 Bitcoin itself wouldn't have been worth much to me ever."
4-5-5-1-1-1,And that is perfectly fine.You dont have to maximize profits.Even professional traders don't try to do that. Its a bad strategy.
4-5-5-2,Reminds me of  who’s still obsessively trying to recover a hard drive full of bitcoin that he threw out in 2013.
4-5-5-3,"Don't underestimate the power of emotion in the world of investing though. A lot of times entire markets rise and fall on emotions caused by speculation, rumors, social rallies and the likes."
5,SLPT: You should only buy bitcoin when its value is at its highest
5-1,buy high sell low is the way
5-1-1,You have a future with a big bank.
5-1-1-1,Svb
5-1-1-2,Just do whatever and get bailed out when you fuck up. The American way
5-1-2,Cryptobro logic
5-1-2-1,They gotta find the next sucker so they can get out.
5-1-2-1-1,It'll blow your mind when you begin to understand that this is literally how all money works and has always worked. Money is an imaginary tool.
5-1-2-1-1-1,"Eh, tell me something I don’t already know."
5-1-2-1-1-1-1,"I can have four caffè lungo's in the morning without triggering a bowel movement, but three coffee and a cigarette will activate a bowel movement so intense, it travels in time to give the victims of Pompeii a priori traumatic stress disorder. This was my morning ritual up to June 2014, when I stopped smoking."
5-1-3,That could actually work since other people lose so much money buying low and that's it.
5-1-4,Never buy when high.Always wait for the crystal meth to wear off.
5-1-5,Always buy high sell low.
5-2,"I was given 10 bitcoin around this time by someone I helped drag through a dungeon to help speed level his toon in WoW. He also showed me how to spend it on a $50 gamestop gift card, which I did. Today, it would've been worth $240k, and at its peak, it would've been worth $600k."
5-2-1,What did you buy with your $600k GameStop gift card?
5-2-1-1,"If I remember right, it was either farcry 3 or Warhammer 40k Space Marine."
5-2-1-1-1,"The memories made with Farcry 3 are worth more than 600k, don't worryI aspire to find my own Rook island"
5-2-1-1-1-1,i could have made my own far cry 3 with that money
5-2-1-1-1-1-1,"God that would be the dream. Imagine being a billionaire filling an island with cassowaries, tigers, pigs, strange plants, etc and just living lifeI wouldn't be in LA in a private jet, I would be eating snakes and hunting pirates with surplus WW2 weapons"
5-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,so many homeless people
5-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,I think you're vastly overestimating a half million dollars.
5-2-1-1-1-2,"I think it was actually Space Marine I got with it because it was Cataclysm dungeons, and that expansion ended in 2012 being replaced by Mists of Pandaria, and Farcry didn't come out until 2012 while Space Marine came out in 2011 too. Plus, the Bitcoin prices line up better after looking into it."
5-2-1-2,"at it's peak, 4.2 million on hot sauce here.ouch.then again, if people like us hadn't spent it, it never would have risen in value.still hurts to think about though."
5-2-1-2-1,"I had somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0 on a laptop back when mining on a laptop was possible. After 3 hours of running my laptop at a temperature that I could cook an egg on it, I called it quits. A few years ago i made some attempts to boot it up, but couldn't get it running and think I chucked it into the trash. If I find it one day, I'll double your profits and buy you another bottle of hot sauce."
5-2-1-2-2,"I'm not at all sure that's the case. The reason it's priced so ridiculously sky-high is because it's being used as an investment rather than for actually spending. For it to ever be used as actual currency that normal people have any interest in using, it has to become a lot more stable, and that means people will have to be made uninterested in simply holding on to it as an investment. So at the end of the day, that means all those people who use it as an investment need to be badly burned to put off others before whatever promise bitcoin had can actually be realised."
5-2-2,"Eh don’t beat yourself up, you’d probably have sold at 500 dollars at best."
5-2-2-1,"Haha, thanks. I'm not worried about it, though. There was zero way of knowing what Bitcoin would have turned into at the time. It was supposed to be a currency alternative rather than the crazy investment type thing it's turned into. Even the most optimistic people in the community didn't expect Bitcoin to blow up to the extent that it did. When I got it in 2011, it was only worth a bit over $5 and going downward."
5-2-2-1-1,Without people like you spending Bitcoin the way you did it wouldn't have grown to be what it is today.
5-2-2-2,I was set to purchase $100 of Bitcoin when it was worth about $2 I know exactly when I would have sold it still would have made $15k.
5-2-3,I was gifted Bitcoin back when it was less than a cent. It was the joke payment of the day. I eventually had enough to buy a $14 pizza. Today that pizza could’ve let me and my family retire.
5-2-3-1,"Yeah, I wouldn't sweat it. As I said to someone else, there was no way of knowing what Bitcoin could've turned into."
5-2-3-1-1,Oh yea I’m not too down about it honestly. If anything I like to tell the story whenever someone talks about Bitcoin. Hindsight is 20/20
5-2-3-1-1-1,"Same, lol. Whenever the topic of bitcoin or crypto comes up, I like to tell the story, too. The reaction is generally ""ouch"" or at least that's the summary of the reactions. But nah. I probably would've forgotten about it and lost it when I inevitably got a new pc, so I'm glad I got a dope game out of it at least lol."
5-2-4,"A buddy of mine still has 15 or so.  Never talks about it, he’s only ever cashed out a single time to buy a home, and won’t again until it’s time to retire.  Doesn’t even think about it if he can help it, and I think he’s been successful at it.  We’ve been hanging out and the topic of Bitcoin in general will somehow come up, you can see a look of him remembering on his face, he gets a giant grin, then he sort of just shakes it away."
5-2-4-1,"I'm calling bullshit or your friend is already independently wealthy or something. That's about $4M which is enough to retire on right now.edit: OP corrected to 15btc, that's ""just"" $400k."
5-2-4-1-1,"That $ amount made me jump, 15, sorry, it’s been corrected.  He might do the same with 150, though.  He’s had some bad habits in the past, the expensive and dangerous kind.  $4 million in his pocket wouldn’t be a smart move for him."
5-2-4-1-3,I guess $4MM is enough to retire in Alabama or some other shithole state
5-2-4-1-3-1,"you can comfortably take 5% per year on interest, which puts you at a 200k retirement income indefinitely. not too shabby."
5-2-4-1-3-1-1,"Right, and given the price of housing these days, that should suffice for a ""cheap"" place, as long as you don't have any medical expenses."
5-2-4-1-3-1-1-1,Please reference your source/location where $4 million wouldn’t get you set home-wise for life.
5-3,This is one old meme.
5-3-1,Old but gold
5-4,"As a not very wealthy man, my biggest regret in life is not buying any bitcoin when it was dirt cheap. That shit keeps me awake at night."
5-4-1,"Best not to think too much about the past, there’s nothing we can do about it. Instead, invest all your money in crypto and questionable stocks now! You’ll never know if they blow up in 20 years."
5-4-2,"Even if you bought some, you wouldn't have held it to its peak I promise.I strongly feel the only people that made 1000x returns were the ones that truly believed in btc and weren't just in it for the money, or the ones that lost their wallets and found them years later.There were way too many ups and downs throughout the years. People forget the years it was stagnant. Or the time it went to literally $0 etc."
5-4-2-1,"HA! I currently own around 10,000 worth of stock that's now valued at about 1600 bucks.  It truely is a waiting game."
5-4-2-1-1,Yeah uhhh….
5-4-2-1-2,If you never sell you never made any loses!
5-4-3,"Don't dwell on it too much. Hindsight can be a curse. Say you did buy a few at $6. You can't know for certain you wouldn't have sold when it was $60 or $600. Let alone $60,000. You would never have known *when* to sell."
5-4-4,that's like your biggest regret being not choosing the right lottery numbers
5-4-5,"A few years back I was angry at myself for not mining BTC back when it was doable with GPUs, but then I realized I would've spent it instantly anyway so who cares. I was 15 and a huge nerd, watching Linus Tech Tips every day and this was exactly around the time bitcoin was getting more mainstream among nerds (2013)"
5-5,I’m suddenly imagining some time traveller hanging out with crypto bros in 2005 and being like “it’ll never be a viable currency but a bunch of idiots will think it will be so I’ll make bank off on this stuff once
5-5-1,It didn't exist in 2005
5-5-1-1,"I dunno, a year or two after it was made, I’m too young to remember when it was made"
5-5-1-1-1,And googling is way too fuckin hard
5-5-1-1-1-2,"No I just figured that surely it was older than 2005, I honestly guessed it was an idea that came out of the late nineties, sounds like something that would start development then"
5-5-1-1-1-2-1,"We were still using dial up, and not every home had internet in 90s. To play everquest I had to turn on the game and come back in a while."
5-5-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Reminds me of my dad telling me about Everquest. He’d beat up a monster, and it would take 20-30 or so minutes to respawn. He lived next to a Subway so he’d just go and get a sandwich while the game was running"
5-5-1-2,Whenever I see people talk shit about Bitcoin I'm always skeptical because usually it's people like this
6,"""Dad, can I borrow $10 worth of bitcoin?""""Borrow $11.62? ... What the hell do you need $7.45 of bitcoin for?"""
6-1,As someone who once owned what today would be a fortune of bitcoins I approve of this joke.
6-1-1,I won 10 Bitcoin from a stupid middle school science fair/project thing but we couldn’t set up the account on school wifi and I was too lazy to go home and set it up for what was basically a quarter so I took home a nice crisp 5 dollar bill instead.
6-1-1-1,"If it's any consolation, had you actually had them and kept track of them, you'd have probably cashed them in or whatever as soon as it hit being worth around $100.  Nobody could have seen the peak coming that far in advance, and you'd have always been thinking ""this has got to be it"".We played around with them when they were basically worthless, and I honestly don't feel like I have missed out on being a multi millionaire, because I would never have held onto them until it got to that point."
6-1-1-1-1,seriously I know someone who bought a bunch when they were around a couple hundred bucks and freaked out and sold them when they got to like 600. they were nearly 70k at one point holy cow.
6-1-1-1-1-1,I too once asked money from my father back when I was in middle school to buy bitcoin but my father thought they were online scam
6-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Ha, my mother didn’t want me to delve into that too in 2010 or 11, idk, it was dirt cheap."
6-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"When I was like 12 or 13 I wanted to buy 1 for about $250. My mother didn’t want me to use her credit card and told me to wait till I got one of my mine so she didn’t have to deal will it, it hit about $45 or $50k when I got my first credit card lol"
6-1-1-1-1-1-2,"I was that dad. I asked: you can put money in, but are you sure you can get it out? Banks in UK were not accepting proceeds from Bitcoin, as it failed money-laundering standards."
6-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,"But...you don't need banks for Bitcoin. That's kinda the whole point of it. You can do a peer to peer exchange where you give someone your Bitcoin and they give you cash in return, without the bank ever knowing."
6-1-1-1-1-1-2-2,You can just buy in cash AND sell in cash.
6-1-1-1-1-1-3,He wasn't exactly wrong.....
6-1-1-1-1-1-4,"He was right, it just took people a bit too long to figure it out"
6-1-1-1-1-1-5,"To be fair, back then it wasnt as easy and clear cut to buy Bitcoin online. Even the regular stock market only had one or two websites/apps to buy and sell stock."
6-1-1-1-1-2,"I sold about $6,000 worth to help pay for a university degree. It would have been worth $700k at peak, but it could have also been $0. I'll take what I can get."
6-1-1-1-1-3,oh yea absolutely. I played wow and other mmos and was in the main botting software websites for a few mmos as I liked to code for that kind of stuff.Bitcoin stuff was going around. I laughed when someone paid for a pizza in bitcoin Think I bought a few at like $1 than sold it when it was $10.Absolutely no way in hell I would have kept any past a few thousand profit.
6-1-1-1-1-5,Yeah I mined like 2 bitcoin when they were worth like 30 cents. Sold when they hit $1k. Never would have imagined how high they’d go.
6-1-1-1-1-5-1,"“ Never would have imagined how high they’d go.”Ain’t seen nothin’ yet, in all likelihood."
6-1-1-1-2,The only people still holding since 2011 are searching landfills for their old harddrive or doing time.
6-1-1-1-2-1,Tire my house apart looking for my old HD for this reason. Resigned myself to the fact I don't have it anymore!
6-1-1-1-2-1-1,I actually have my old hard drive but don’t know how to access the account. Any idea how I’d go about accessing them?
6-1-1-1-2-1-1-2,"buy an $8 SATA to USB adapter from Ebay....connect your old HDD to your puter and read the old HDD like you would any other external drive...IE , a ""flash drive"" ..."
6-1-1-1-2-1-2,"Oh dear, this is me too! I have 50 Bitcoin sotting on a hard drive somewhere in my parents’ house from when I was in college in 2010, and every holiday take a couple of hours to look for it. At this point I have pretty much resigned myself to knowing it’s probably in a landfill somewhere!"
6-1-1-1-2-2,"My husband bought back then. We just paid off our house last year and he’s saving some for when the kids get older. But also, he lost a BUNCH of other crypto because he didn’t keep track of passwords."
6-1-1-1-2-2-1,"He actually held all this time? I'm impressed. Or did he sell, then buy more? A lot of people who got in early did that."
6-1-1-1-3,"My niece bought $75 worth of crypto on a whim. A couple years later, it bought her a Kawasaki. Her timing was impeccable."
6-1-1-1-5,"The keeping track of them, or lack there of, is where most people made their money. Forgetting you had any until “the News” did a story on it."
6-1-1-2,"Back in 2010 I played some stupid shitty browser game and a piece of equipment dropped, something I already had or was not an improvement to my own gear.  The game had a marketplace where you could trade stuff, but most would put good stuff on ebay and sell it for real money then trade it to the ebay winner on that marketplace.  I decided to do that and posted them for sale for $5.  Some guy from the game asked me if I would take $5 worth of Bitcoin, this was around the time of some dude paying 10k bitcoin for a couple pizzas, so $5 was around 1500 bitcoin.  I was not interested in bitcoin as there were not many places that would take it, it was sketchy at best around that time.  I said no and took $5 over Paypal.  Sometimes I think about how I could have made close to $100,000,000 off of some shitty browser game, but the reality is when that ~1500 bitcoin became worth over $100, I would have dumped it."
6-1-2,Yea I remember when bitcoin was kind a joke but making its rounds (2011/12)A hookah bar near me was the only place that accepted it as payment at the time. I still wonder if the owner kept it and is filthy rich or if they sold.
6-1-2-1,"I feel the regret, but anyone else could claim that they’d won the lottery the day before if they’d just picked the right numbers."
6-1-4,As your long lost but recently resurfaced relative I happen to notice and feel obliged to point out the way you phrase it makes it sound there is now a fortune of money instead?
6-1-4-1,Just pizza. Depending on the pizza though it may still be worth running the long lost relative angle.
6-1-4-1-1,"Back in my dumb days we were pushing a lot of ""party favors"" (circa 11-13) that we bought from something that rhymes with milk toad. We used to pay 20% to convert bitcoins to a credit card and party with. Concert tickets, taxis, Pizzas, hotels etc. It's crazy how much money even in today's value of Bitcoin we spent on that shit."
6-3,"When this joke was popular, bitcoin was over $50,000 each."
6-3-1,"nope, when that joke was popular the kid actually asked for 10 bitcoin and not 10$ worth of bitcoin. the worth values seem to be the ones from the original joke."
7,Bitcoin Breaks Down $20K: Now Below 2017’s Previous All-time High
7-1,On the bright side I think the taxman owes me money at this point.
7-1-1,Cap on net capital loss deduction for given year is like $3k I believe.
7-1-1-1,"It is $3k but say you lose $60k in one year well congratulations you get to use that deduction for 20 years. This is a deduction a lot more people than you think still use from the 2009 recession, y'all should be careful so you don't wind up using that shit a decade from now and giving your cpa another story to tell."
7-1-1-1-1,It took me 17 years to exhaust my capital loss from the dot com crash.
7-1-1-1-2,People get this wrong all the time. You can deduct more than 3k/yr if you have more gains!!Say you lose 30k in one year. You do not have to wait 10 years to claim it all. If the next year you make 30k back then your cap gains will be $0 because you can claim UP TO a 3k/yr loss in a year. NOT 3k in just losses.
7-1-1-1-2-2,Haha gains?
7-1-1-1-2-5,> you can claim UP TO a 3k/yr loss in a yearHow is this more than 3k/year?
7-1-1-1-2-5-1,If I carry 20k in losses over from last year and this year I make 5k in gains then I can use 8k of that 20k I carried over to bring my total capital gains losses to -3k this year even though I made 5k. I then carry the remaining 12k over to the following year.Many people incorrectly think you can only USE 3k but it's actually a max loss of 3k per year limit which sounds the same but in the example above you see how it is different.
7-1-1-1-2-5-1-1,"Oh! I see. I'll look into it, because I was under the notion (misconception you refer to) that I can only apply -3k from the carryover annually. Thanks!"
7-1-1-1-4,Crypto brosLosses cause they literally have no idea about anything bar 'hurr durr crypto good'And you expect them to use a CPA for their taxes? The only ones using a CPA are the ones that are Trust Fund babies
7-1-1-2,"You’re allowed to completely offset gains, deduct an additional 3k in losses, and carry forward the rest to future years if there’s more left over after all of that."
7-1-1-2-1,Gains lol
7-1-1-2-1-1,Yeah. Let's say you lost $100k. It will take your 33 years to exhaust that if you have no gains. What are the chances the market doesn't go up for 33 years?
7-1-1-2-2,"Ya that's basically what he said...""Allowed to offset all your gains plus up to 3k in losses every year"" is just a slightly happier way of saying ""can only deduct up to 3k in net losses per year."""
7-1-2,"Ya seriously. On the bright side a lot of people are going to scapegoat crypto taxes because of all this, claiming all those losses of course."
7-1-2-1,You mean on the bright side a lot of people can finally buy reasonably priced GPUs
7-1-4,IRS hates this one simple trick!
7-1-4-1,I got fucked in the ass by old taxes. I suggest no one try shady shit unless they can afford the lawyer
7-1-5,"The fun thing about 2021 into 2022 is I did a *lot* of trading in 2021 and turned a decent profit. I reinvested that profit into other plays and held into 2022, where they all crashed. So I paid a fun amount of taxes on money that doesn’t even exist anymore."
7-2,Invested in crypto for the first time in 2017. Held ever since. I'm officially in the red again lol.
7-2-1,You merely adopted the red. I was born in it.
7-2-1-1,Ahh a fellow millennial
7-2-1-1-1,Ahh my brothers who went in to multiply their money but had it divided instead.
7-2-1-1-1-1,"still multiplied! Just, by a fraction."
7-2-2,Jesus Christ y’all stop listening to the people that call you paper hands. You’d literally be set for this recession if you had taken profits.
7-2-2-1,"It's amazing people buy all of that obvious propaganda meant to pump everybody else's investments. Like .. you see why they're doing that, right? It's like people can't think for themselves."
7-2-2-3,Truth. I'd be shitting if I didn't have that cash in the bank.
7-2-3,why wont u take some profit when it was 50-60k? risk mgmt comes first. imagine taking profit there and now buying the dipin the immortal words of cobie HODL is for poor
7-3,It's been an honor gambling with you guys 
7-3-1,Crypto giveth and crypto taketh.
7-3-1-1,Crypto is a great servant but a cruel master
7-3-1-1-1,I like bad boys
7-3-2,Time to put on my knife catching gloves!
7-3-2-1,Gloves?  I need a full body suit for what’s coming.
7-3-2-3,Funny how an investment falls when the government isn’t providing the funds for people to invest in it…
7-3-3,"My pleasure bro, my pleasure     Down 60%"
7-3-3-2,If they still say the same thing when prices dip to $10k-$20k.Then those people will never buy and they are the small % who shouldn't be included in the next bull run.
7-4,“Plays the violin while on the titanic”
7-4-2,I'm gonna have to take up busking to buy crypto soon
7-4-3,At least it cheers people up while they are going down.
7-5,So we are back to we are early right?
7-5-1,We're early in the recession 
7-5-1-1,Yay! I'm finally early to something
7-5-1-1-1,"Well, no joke? I mean, a recession could take Bitcoin to very low prices for years but after that it will recover and maybe it takes 5-10 years but it will probably make a new ATH.If the economy is strong again and crypto has improved no doubt it will make a new ATH."
7-5-2,"we are back to ""in it for the tech"""
7-5-2-2,I’m in it for the masochism
8,Bitcoin did less macro-harm when it was used to buy drugs and fake passports
8-1,"This is a friendly reminder to .Remember, /r/Showerthoughts is for showerthoughts, not ""thoughts had in the shower!""(For an explanation of what a ""showerthought"" is, .)**Rule-breaking posts may result in bans.**"
8-2,I miss the days when you could have a nice side hustle selling your old underwear on reddit for Bitcoin.
8-2-1,You still can. Just not on reddit.
8-2-1-1,Care to share with the class? People tryna make a doller out of 50 cents
8-2-1-1-1,"Oh I don‘t actually know anything specific. I just know that there are some sites apparently because I saw a video on youtube where a guy tried how much money he could make from selling worn socks. I could try to find the video and see if the site is mentioned, but it‘s in german so I don‘t know if that would be helpful."
8-4,A whole lotta copium being smoked by crypto bros in this thread lol
8-4-1,It garners the same sort of emotional attachment as any ideology that people adopt as part of their identity.
8-4-1-2,I seems to me that you are the one who has an attachment to banks and fiat money and can¨t think of anything else than what you have been brainwashed into as real money.
8-4-1-2-1,How’s FTX doing?
8-4-1-2-1-1,"Saying Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies are bad because an exchange gambled away customers deposits is a kind of thinking error.It would be like saying currency x is bad because a bank gambled it away.Cryptocurrencies are the only digital form of money you can really own. When the money is in the bank it is not yours, you only have a claim on it. If you think it is bad to be able to own your own money like humans have used to be able for all of human history until the last few decades, than I will respect your opinion."
8-4-1-2-1-1-1,"Cryptocurrency is not currency. As in, nobody uses it as currency. Nobody uses crypto to buy goods and services. Oh sure it's *possible*, but nobody *does*.  The only, ONLY thing crypto is ""used"" for, is to scam people out of *actual* currency. That's it. Did it not ever strike you as worrisome, that the only way you know how good your crypto is doing it, is by it's value in *dollars*? It doesn't have value by itself. Maybe it should? Maybe it could? Maybe. But it definitely, definitely *doesn't.*"
8-4-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Nobody? I have bought lots of things, and everything legal like computergames, furniture etc. So much for your nobody.Also there is a reason that few use it and that is that using it is a taxable event unlike the bank currencies who have a monopoly which gives them an unfair advantage."
8-4-1-2-1-1-1-2,I use my crypto to buy uh stuff.
8-4-1-2-1-1-1-3,"It’s a niche rn just like the internet back in the 90’s. Anything that has value and can be sent is technically money, but sure 99.999% of crypto is unsound money.Just stick to Bitcoin which beats gold at being money by a longshot."
8-4-2,Few understand /sSO r/buttcoin
8-4-2-1,"Yeah it is really easy to be right when you just ignore counterpoints and just tell people they don't understand. It is the equivalent of ""the lord works in mysterious ways"" argument with religion."
8-4-2-1-1,Or you don’t want to argue with anti-social weirdos online. But I don’t know the lord works in mysterious ways
8-4-3,"If you could sell copium as a product, you'd be a billionaire off of crypto-bros alone right now.  Check out r/cryptocurrency threads, where everything that has happened the last few weeks has either been resounding good news for the future of crypto, or all a conspiracy by evil normal bankers/politicians to destroy crypto from the inside"
8-4-3-1,"Those idiots don’t realize that if we just could rid ourselves of this pesky Bitcoin, we’d have utopia by now."
8-4-5,the worst is probably the safemooners
8-5,Honestly sad at the state of Crypto because idiots gambled their savings listening to every fake Tony Robbins and Bernie Madoff saying its a sure thing. These are the same (literally in some case) that lost their fucking load on the .com bubble and buying too many beanie babies.
8-5-1,"They actually made money. But as with most investors. Knowing when to stop pouring capital in and take profits instead of falling for greed is the first lesson they learn, after they stop blaming others for their own decisions that is"
8-5-2,Bitcoin≠Crypto
8-5-2-1,Okay then what is it?
8-5-2-1-1,"Right now, ""Crypto"" is coming to mean ""any of the 200,000 scams based on copying the tech behind Bitcoin""."
8-5-2-1-1-1,"Including the original scam, Bitcoin.It being the first doesn't mean it's not what it is."
8-5-2-1-1-1-1,Who created this scam? They should be arrested then/s
8-5-2-1-1-1-2,"Bitcoin is actually one of the worst cryptos that exists. Basically everything else has some improvement to it. Monero/Dash are anonymous, and although it's often used for illegitimate means privacy is still good. Ethereum (especially with PoS) is less resource intensive than Bitcoin, has faster transactions, and can be used in creative ways. Even Litecoin is just an improved version of Bitcoin. XMR/XRP are set up very well for international transfers, and even have utility for banks. Storage coins (crypto for storage space) kinda suck right now but have really cool uses. Not the ones that destroy storage, the ones you can rent out as cloud storage. Especially as they increase redundancy. Bitcoin is the worst crypto, except maybe dogecoin. The rest are still kinda *meh* but they have real world uses. Bitcoin doesn't."
8-5-2-1-1-1-2-1,"You're getting downvoted, but you're not wrong. Crypto sucks in general, but... Bitcoin sucks up computation power like a hungry dog eats a meal, it has an abysmal transaction rate limit, it's not exceptionally secure...I don't get the opinion from BTC bros that the crypto universe nailed it perfectly first try and Bitcoin is the ultimate coin. It's actually pretty shit. I understand these people worship the ground Satoshi Nakamoto walked on, but.. Why?I suppose denying reality is a necessary skill to have when your thesis for your financial future is ""The whole world will use Bitcoin bro, it's still early!"" but come on...I think the idea that other coins have real world uses is... Debatable. Most of them are ""Look at this cool idea we had that'd work really well if it wasn't on a blockchain!"" at best. But I'd agree that if you threw a dart at a board filled with shitcoins, it'd be rare to hit one that's theoretically worse than Bitcoin."
8-5-2-1-1-1-3,"Let me guess - you put full 10 minutes of ""researching"" and another 2 of thinking about it before coming to your entirely self made conclusion, am I right?"
8-5-2-1-2,"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrecy.  It's like saying dogs are not the same as mammals. They're A mammal, sure. But they aren't exactly the same as ""mammal""."
8-5-2-1-3,"Bitcoin is a currency and/or digital gold that's not controlled by a central bank.Cryptocurrency is digital money secured with math (such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Etherium, etc)Cryptography is the science of using math to make messages, computers, etc secure so people can't snoop around with or change stuff they aren't supposed to.Crypto is a scam.Edit: why all the downvotes?  ""Crypto"" is a broad buzzword that includes nonsense like NFTs and DeFi."
8-5-2-1-3-1,Sorry how is crypto ≠ cryptocurrency ? What exactly is crypto then ?
8-5-2-1-3-1-1,Don't worry that dude is an idiot with no idea what he's talking about
8-5-2-1-3-1-1-2,"> that dude is an idiotWanna bet?""Crypto"" isn't even grammatically a word, it's a prefix. If it's used by itself, it's vague and broad and could mean anything from Etherium to NFTs to a child's cipher wheel from a book called ""how to be a spy for kids""."
8-5-2-1-3-1-2,"Crypto is a buzzword. Cryptocurrency is a specific term for a thing. People say ""crypto"" when they're scamming you with NFTs and stuff or trying to get gullible investors on board."
8-5-2-1-3-1-2-1,So what is something like crypto dot com? What exactly do they do? I see that shit online all the time. And aren’t nfts already gone from the big picture?
8-5-2-1-3-2,"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.There's tons of cryptocurrencies, some of which use the ledger/blockchain for **other things** besides the coin, like Ethereum."
8-5-2-1-3-3,Actually impressive how wrong you are. Good effort champ
8-5-2-1-3-3-1,"Nah, the last sentence was right."
8-5-2-1-3-3-1-1,I’m fairly sure that the second to last one is right as well. 2 out of 4 I guess.
9,Exxon is mining bitcoin in North Dakota as part of its plan to slash emissions
9-1,"""Sir, what's your company's plan for cutting down on emissions to combat the threat of manmade climate change brought upon us by industries such as yours?"""
9-1-1,"""Using more energy to mine cryptocurrency."""
9-1-1-1,It's using energy which would have been burned off anyways to run generators which run the miners. The gas would have been burned either way due to the oil production anyways. It's just a more efficient use of the wasted energy. As bizarre as it is.
9-1-1-1-1,"Not exactly, the more computational power we throw at bitcoin the more computationally intensive the system becomes. Theres really no “saving energy” or “using free energy” with bitcoin."
9-1-1-1-1-1,"Your premise is correct, but conclusion is wrong.When you add a pool of new miners the networks, it does become more energy intensive to mine crypto. But you forgot that increased energy requirements means miners using grid-power will make less $/W and be thus incentivised to halt expansion or decommision their operation.&#x200B;Bitcoin is all about who can use the least $ in electricity for the most compute power. And since Exxon would presumably be using free electricity they undercut the competition, driving grid-miners offline."
9-1-1-1-1-1-1,So what you're telling me is that in a roundabout way cheep graphics cards may make a return?
9-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,Cheap graphics cards will make a return. Not because of exxon.  But because the crypto Ethereum responsible for the purchase of 20% of all new graphics cards. Is estimated to switch away from using gpu mining within 3mo.
9-1-1-1-1-2,The tiny amount of miners they'll add to the system is nothing compared to the dedicated mining operations with warehouses full of miners.
9-1-1-1-1-3,"Ok but read the article. This is coming from a converted natural gas line that was going to be burned off anyways. Based on the article, using it to mine crypto in its current form will be 63% more efficient in CO2 emissions comparing to flaring by itself. So they profit and reduce emissions, as backwards as it seems."
9-1-1-1-1-4,If people mine bitcoin at a net cost they stop mining.
9-1-1-1-3,"This is bullshit.Bitcoin in incentive them do do this shit instead of anything else.You actually can store this gas and transport it and use it somewhere else.This consumes it, also produces the same amount of CO2, the energy they generate now tx to Bitcoin is used for Bitcoin which consumes hardware and makes it harder / more effort to mine for others.This is the worst case scenario after just burning it..."
9-1-1-1-3-1,No. Shut up. No. A ton of the gas is shipped away. A great deal still can't be. Depending on infrastructure you might end up burning a ton of gas off because it would cost more to do all the things to capture and store it than it would be to sell. You really that worried about supplies of Antminers bud? Feel like you're just regurgitating random talking points you've heard that you think are relevant. Source: worked O&G for 10 years in 5 states + Canada. Also mine Eth at home. Used Eth mining to pay for my solar. I've probably done more to support renewable energy than you.

9-2,">Exxon’s bitcoin project isn’t really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather, the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands.Let me be incredibly skeptical of this claim.

9-3,Slash emissions!!! That’s hilarious!!! What a roundabout way to say “make more money”!!!
9-3-1,Slash emissions with commissions
9-3-1-1,Happy cake day!
9-3-1-2,Slash commisions
9-3-1-3,I read that in Jackie Chiles's voice (Kramer's lawyer): Your emissions are my commissions!
9-3-1-3-1,You put the balm on?  Who told you to put the balm on?  I didn’t tell you to put the balm on!  Where’d you get this balm anyway?
9-3-2,The gas is still being burned to generate electricity as well.  So CO2 still gets emitted anyways.
9-3-2-1,"The idea is that flaring creates more emissions. Basically that using it in a generator is better than just venting out gas and lighting it on fire, which is what's currently done"
9-3-2-1-1,It could be utilized to generate energy for some useful.Crypto mining is pointlessly increasing co2 emissions.  It doesn’t need to exist
9-3-2-1-1-1,"but you see, gas isnt profitable. Crypto mining is the most eco-friendly *profitable* optionis it the most efficient? Who cares… right?"
9-3-2-1-1-1-1,>Crypto mining is the most eco-friendly   >  >profitable  >  > optionIf you had to name the two things is most is not...
9-3-2-1-1-1-2,The emissions created from crypto mining are reason enough to ban it from use.The planet and everyone on it should be shifting to reduce emissions.
9-3-2-1-1-1-2-1,"They are indeed reducing emissions. Methane is 7x more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and longer lived. So they are indeed reducing their previous emissions by 7x"
9-3-2-1-1-1-2-3,There's about a thousand things that use more energy than Bitcoin mining. Such as the banking industry (3x) or gold mining (3x) or Christmas lights. Bitcoin mining is majority from renewable energy as well so your point doesn't make much sense.
9-3-2-1-1-2,That requires electrical or pipeline infrastructure that doesn't exist
9-3-2-1-1-2-1,"For instance the servers could be processing something different, such as large datasets for research purposes."
9-3-2-1-1-2-1-1,"They could be, but it doesn't sound like any datacentre company is willing to buy the gas off them. One big difference between mining and a datacentre is that a DC requires far more in bandwidth, based on this  you could run a pretty serious operation using starlink but for a DC you'd need multiple redundant lines of 10 GB at a minimum. There's also the fact that a DC would still need grid power in case of failure, whilst it doesn't matter too much if a mining operation goes down for a few days whilst the generator is repaired."
9-3-2-1-1-2-2,"It can be built tho.  The route they are taking is just the most profitable, and it’s being incorrectly spun as a means to reduce emissions."
9-3-2-1-1-2-2-1,"It can, companies are mining Bitcoin where that infrastructure doesn't exist yet.  They're more than happy to sell it to the grid instead if the infrastructure is available.  But in the meanwhile you can bring in a seacan full of mining rigs and use that extra power for *something*.But, yeah, it's for sure spin.  But if the local government is allowing them to vent or flare excess gas and they are voluntarily bringing in generators and mining rigs to make use of it instead, it is reducing emissions."
9-3-2-1-1-2-2-2,So you want to create more emissions to solve your too many emissions problems?
9-3-2-1-1-2-2-3,">That requires electrical or pipeline infrastructure that doesn't exist&#x200B;>It can be built tho. The route they are taking is just the most profitable&#x200B;>It's a private company, doing what is most profitable is their job. If you want regulation then you need to look to the government.Amazing, you're both right! "
9-3-2-1-1-4,"It can’t though. >	The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation?>	Unlike oil, which can be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline, producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away, drillers often burn it off. That’s why you typically see flames rising from oil fields.The problem seems to be bursty production and location of the resources relative to infrastructure. If they could economically capture the gas for sale, presumably they would."
9-3-2-1-1-4-1,"Yes it absolutely could be done, and you know what?  the oil companies would still rake in billions in profits.The it can't be ""economically"" done is some propagandizing bullshit.  It could be done it could be captured but it would come at a cost of a small fraction of the companies profits.  It isn't being done due to their greed."
9-3-2-1-1-4-1-1,"It would cost more and emit more in CO2 emissions to build a pipeline or electrical infrastructure and refine the flare-off product than the flare-off itself.Bitcoin is actually a perfect solution to this because the electricity demand can be moved to the location it is needed instead of needing to build infrastructure to it.  And consuming the electricity, as others have pointed out, is less wasteful and less polluting than the flare itself.  Sorry, you don't know what you are talking about here."
9-3-2-1-1-4-1-2,"If the has pocket had enough gas to make it economical, they would. Most of these pockets they hit while drilling for oil aren't going to be large enough to make their money back if they built pipelines to it."
9-3-2-1-1-5,No crypto doesn't need to exist.  Just a waste.  But that isn't the point.  In the US it either makes money or you dump it the most economical way.  I think it is stupid as well but it is the US.     I read the entire article and this is much better than before.  I guess electricity just sells for to cheap to just flog it off so they need Bitcoin to turn a profit.    They went from 30% flare off or vent to 3-5.  That's something at least
9-3-2-1-2,"That's like saying having your toe smashed with a tack hammer is better than having your toe smashed with a ball peen hammer.Yes it's true, but it's still gonna fucking hurt."
9-3-2-2,"I actually think this kind of makes good sense.Methane (the main part of natural gas) is a very potent greenhouse gas, some 25x more so than CO2 - so capturing it from oil wells (even if you just burn it & convert it to co2) is a significant benefit. The problem is that this is a cost center for an oil producer. It costs money to capture, the pipe work to do it is notoriously leaky and there's not really any incentive to do better (tragedy of the commons and all). If the production of NG were higher then piping it to the market would make sense, but that's almost certainly not commercially viable here.Being able to convert a waste product into hard cash, is going to provide a huge incentive for exxon to actually fucking capture it. Now when there's a leak in their methane capture system at a well, an accountant will notice because fixing that leak will drive revenue (rather than increase cost)."
9-3-2-2-1,"Shhh, being pro-bitcoin outside of a crypto subreddit, no matter how right you are, is dangerous."
9-3-2-2-1-1,I wish people didn't lump every cryptocurrency into the same bucket as Bitcoin.Hopefully that will begin to change once Ethereum (finally) switches to PoS.
9-3-2-2-1-1-1,"I'm not keeping my hopes up for that, unfortunately. Even the most basic technology is hard enough for the average individual to understand, let alone a technology that intersects software, hardware, and economics."
9-3-2-3,"But it's better than emitting whatever's coming out of the ground, which is what happens with leaky wells and other abandoned shit from that industry"
9-3-2-3-1,I agree. It always kind of bums me when an evil corporation gets criticized for being slightly less evil than expected
9-3-2-3-1-1,Motive. They're not being slightly less evil to be slightly less evil. They're doing it because profit happens to coincide with less evil... this time.
9-3-2-3-1-2,"It's so cringe, it seems like they think a company like Exxon/Total would just shut their doors rather than attempt to pivot. Same with the whole ""O&G companies like hydrogen, therefor hydrogen bad"" crowd, yes blue hydrogen sucks ass assuming CCS isn't used, but they're going to want to use their pipelines for \*something\*, transporting eventual green H2 is a fantastic pivot strategy"
9-3-2-3-1-2-1,"But this isn't a pivot. They're producing emissions in order to produce nothing at all, and say that it's to reduce emissions. It's the *only* thing that plan makes! It's the opposite of a pivot."
9-3-2-3-1-2-2,"I assumed they forgot the /s, but if that actually bums them out, well then that bums me out."
9-3-2-4,CO2 is way better than methane.
9-3-3,Read the entire article.  This sounds crazy but the alternative is to flare off the gas or just vent it.   It is the US. If there is no money to be made or it costs  a dime you throw it away.  I don't understand why it cannot be sold as electricity but maybe that is not enough to turn a dime?
9-3-3-1,"I mean I’m not an expert on North Dakota oil and gas but it seems like the article explains it reasonably enough. Natural gas isn’t something that you just pull a chunk out of the ground, there has to be pipeline infrastructure and sometimes there isn’t enough available or in the right place. You can convert it to electricity using a generator locally, but that’s expensive and what’re you going to do with electricity in the middle of a North Dakota oil field, it’s not like there’s a lot of customers nearby. The answer they came up with is “Bitcoin mining”. Better than nothing imo."
9-3-3-2,"Saudi Aramco can power the entire Bitcoin network with the gas they flare drilling for oil.  They can’t get the gas to market profitably, so they burn it on-site. Bitcoin is a voluntary global monetary system that doesn’t require a Navy to enforce its rules.  If you want green energy production to come online rapidly and don’t want to wait years to get infrastructure from production source to grid, build the solar/wind/geothermal farm first and hook up Bitcoin mines to instantly generate the revenue that will pay for infrastructure connection back to grid. Then do this over and over and over until there is so much solar/wind/geo flooding the market that Gas is only used as backup."
9-3-3-3,"True! Ahh, capitalism."
9-3-3-4,"Because you need a lot of infatructure to transport natural gas that doesn't exist in that location.And theres no point spending, say, 500 mil to build the pipes to move it so you can sell it for 400 mil.If it was economical to build the infrastructure to transport it, obviously they would do that, since there would be no reason not to."
9-3-3-4-1,"  yes, that is what the article says.   What I am saying is maybe they do not get enough for the electricity they produce to sell that back into the system and they need the extra from bitcoin mining to turn a profit.   It seems ass backward but  it is way better than just flaring it off or venting."
9-3-4,It's funny with the amount of power crypto uses too
9-3-5,"Bitcoin mining can be powered using the emissions from oil drilling....this is definitely a way to make more money for Exxon, but they are actually reducing their emissions in the process. Literally a win-win for them."
9-4,Exxon is mining Bitcoin????   I never expected to read that
9-4-1,A large holder in bitcoin from the start was JP Morgan. It’s never been clean of special interest.
9-4-1-1,"It’s a scam. Sure, the technology *might* prove useful for a few niche applications, someday, but the currency and investment side has only two uses: money laundering, and separating suckers from their bank accounts."
9-4-1-1-1,You Bitcoin holders and bank account owners are both suckers. I keep my cash in a treasure chest buried on a beach in the Caribbean. It's proven to be more reliable than crypto or banks.
9-4-1-1-1-1,Except it lost 7% of its value just this year
9-4-3,How much u wanna bet some really smart young exec who came up with the idea is also very smartly slashing and stashing fractions of it for personal storage?
9-5,This is one of many reasons I find people thinking crypto will ‘free up currency for the people’ is misjudged.Exxon can come along and mine _way_ more than anyone in their basement.And so can every other big corp if they decide to.
9-5-1,"I'm pretty sure bitcoin has been at the point no one in their basement can really mine it for years now anyway. It was like 5 years ago I saw the GPU farms on 60 minutes, it hasn't gotten easier since."
9-5-2,This is why crypto has been on borrowed time since the first article was written about it online.There will never be a major industry which isn't ultimately swallowed up and dominated by these massive companies... They'll never allow an opportunity for making money to go unexploited.
9-5-2-1,The success of bitcoin has nothing to do with people mining it in their basements. As long as hash rate is spread out across the world the network is secure.
9-5-2-1-1,"The /network/ is secure.The mission of creating a decentralised currency which gives financial power back to individuals? Dead and buried.Bitcoin will go on, but the idea for which it was created is pretty much dead by now; crypto these days is just a gaggle of big money interests and scam projects."
9-5-2-1-1-1,You sound like you have a 3rd grade level knowledge of crypto
9-5-2-1-1-1-1,"Or simply a different perspective to you. Not everyone who disagrees with you is automatically wrong or misinformed.Even the most diehard Crypto fans know that these days there are a worrying number of scams and rugpulls going on, and the lack of any accountability for people who pull them off is tainting the entire industry."
9-5-3,It’s simply creating another form of currency/medium of exchange.  And the reality is that it’s a huge use of resources to mine and utilize crypto currency.Sure the gas is no longer being flared but it’s still being burned down the road… it’s just now used to generate crypto.
9-5-3-1,>it’s just now ~~used~~ ***wasted*** to generate crypto.
9-5-3-1-1,The flare gas is not worth capturing and using to generate electricity for cities since the oil wells are located in super remote regions. It takes more energy to transport any captured gas than the captured gas contains.
9-5-3-1-1-1,Aren’t they capturing it and using it to generate electricity (to run the crypto farm)?
9-5-3-1-1-1-2,Correct other wise it would just be wasted.
9-5-3-1-2,"We are talking about a worldwide network to transport value without a single CEO, government, dictator or bank to have any say on that. Who can’t see the importance and value of that….Rethink this fact and study it!"
9-5-3-2,"Don't conflate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Yes it's a waste of resources to mine and use bitcoin and many other older cryptos, but newer currencies use other tech like proof of stake which drastically cut down on energy consumption."
9-5-3-2-1,Is it less than the energy needed to produce fiat currency?  What is the breakdown for energy use for each type of crypto?
9-5-3-3,It’s the price to pay to have the most secure digital network ever created.
9-5-4,Whilst I agree Exxon also has more money then me so what has changed?
9-5-4-1,"Nothing, that's the point.  Crypto is advertised as being able to change that and it doesn't."
9-5-4-1-1,"the elites just want a money system that's even easier to exploit in a stock market setting, is all I see"
9-5-4-1-1-1,They want a system without all those pesky regulatory bodies telling them what they can and cannot do
9-5-4-1-1-2,"Plus tax free and a lot easier to lander money, and people wonder why it's getting pushed so hard on the masses."
9-5-4-1-1-2-1,This is…factually incorrect. It has been proven time and again it is much harder to launder with crypto. Do you understand that blockchains make it so that every transaction is linked to one another all the way from creation?
9-5-4-1-1-3,"Yeah, I don't see any problem in offering up more power to multinational conglomerates. Buy crypto, bro."
9-5-4-2,"Imagine the climate denialism level of propaganda exxon has been pushing for decades being used to promote bitcoin or nfts so exxon can scam even more people out of money.They'll use their horde of lobbyists, propaganda grifters and connections to ramp this up to another level. Curious what kind of regulation/no regulation they'll be lobbying for that'll work in their favour.More Crypto bros gonna get scammed, as usual."
9-5-4-3,Your fake money is now worth less.
9-5-4-3-1,But we destroyed the environment even more in the process! That has to count for something!?
9-5-4-4,accelerating the death of a habitable planet for nothing
9-5-5,I think the only real value of bitcoin as a currency is that it’s generally deflationary.
9-5-5-1,Doesn't that mean that it is doomed to be an investing asset and never be the primary currency of exchange?
9-5-5-1-1,"Yes. In other words, it's infinitely useless as a currency."
9-5-5-1-2,Gold is a deflationary asset and the dollar used to be backed by it
9-5-5-1-2-1,Research project for you: when was the last time the dollar was backed 1:1 by gold?
9-5-5-1-2-1-1,That wasn't the point I was even arguing the dollar when backed by gold was the primary medium of exchange and an investing asset till we got off the good standard. Now we follow a system that isn't backed by anything but the government which is inherently flawed. Gold standard is better than what we have today and the Bitcoin standard will be better than gold
9-5-5-1-2-1-1-1,"Under the gold standard the issuance of gold:dollars wasn't one to one. People still hoarded gold as an investment vehicle, which entirely fucked up the supply of gold for actual use. Requiring the government to dig in the ground every time they want to issue new currency makes no sense.Bitcoin requires the same meaningless digging in the ground, except it's unregulated. That's so much worse. It's dark money. People like to shit on banks here, but they provide a vital layer of protection and insurance. There's a reason why every ransomware payment is made in crypto."

10-1-1,how do you even log scale a graph that includes positive and negative values?
10-1-1-1,"Instead of showing (price-cost), which can go negative, show log(price/cost). This shows absolute gain/loss as the log of a ratio. Up 10000% becomes +4.0, down 99% becomes -2.0Then label the Y axis with the original ratios instead of the log values."
10-1-1-1-1,This is the kind of comment that keeps me coming back to this sub. Thanks for the tip!
10-1-1-1-1-1,"This is the first step in modelling asset prices (like stocks, fx, commodities). The basis of derivative pricing is that the log returns of stocks are normally distributed at any timescale. That is: Log of (stock price at some point in the future / stock price today) is normally distributed. So it makes sense to plot stochastic assets like crypto as log returns."
10-1-1-1-1-1-1,This guys plots
10-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,I'm plotting so hard right now
10-1-1-1-1-1-2,>The basis of derivative pricing is that the log returns of stocks are normally distributed at any timescale.Which is an assumption that is very frequently wrong.
10-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Indeed! Log returns with normal distributions is usually the first/second model, and beyond that you tailor. Stocks tend to have fat tails, for example, so you might add a jump process to the mix, or make your volatility (the standard deviation of the distribution per unit time) stochastic. There's a whole zoo of models, but most of them start off with the log normal assumption and iterate."
10-1-1-1-1-2,Well fucking make the graph then ya bum
10-1-1-1-1-2-1,This is the kind  of comment that keeps me coming back to this sub. Thanks for the tip!
10-1-1-1-3,And then the commodity price goes negative and your plotting breaks \^^
10-1-1-4,"someone mentioned symlog without explaining it. It means symmetric log. You basically choose a range around zero (usually [-1,1]) make that linear. above that is log as normal, below that is -log.It's not the right choice hear though since you need an explanation of symlog to make it clear (imo) so it is rarely the right choice unless you need to show sign but the values have huge variations in magnitude. Do manipulating the data so that the values are positive is better here."
10-1-1-5,"You could also just fuck with the tick marks themselves. Such that evenly space gaps for -10, -1 ,0 ,1,10."
10-1-1-5-1,so... a log transformation?
10-1-1-5-1-1,Log10 converts 0.1 to -1 so a log transformation limits at 0. If you want negative and positive inputs you can't use logs directly.
10-1-1-5-1-1-1,"sure, I just don't know what ""fuck with the tick marks"" could mean here without doing a log transformation"
10-1-1-5-1-1-1-1,"A log transformation is take the y or y axis tick marks positions data and shove it through a log transformation. The problem with this for current data set is Y<=0 is a null value due to log10(0.1)=-1 and it limits at y= 0. I'm proposing a similar transformation to a log transformation but is an entirely different transformation. I'm prosing just squashing the Y axis in an exponential way, this is generally easier to set up then alternatives plotting wise."
10-1-2,"Given that the axis is labeled “price change” and “percentage change”, OP was  not attempting to present this in an accurate and forthright manner."
10-1-3,"My concern there is that it wouldn't show the massive increases and decreases, which could make it look like I'm trying to hide something. Though I agree that it makes it harder to read the points close to zero. It's a tradeoff. I tried coloring the dots but that cluttered the chart."
10-1-3-1,"It’ll absolutely show the massive increases, trust me."
10-1-3-2,"If the viewer understands log plots, the huge increases and decreases will be very obvious. Also, log plots are much more appropriate for a time series plot that spans multiple orders of magnitude like this. Especially when trying to assess gains and losses relative to a specific trade price. For example, if the chart had the y axis as log2: you could easily see where someone might have gained 2x or dropped 50% regardless of whether you are looking at 2k or 20k."
10-1-3-2-1,">If the viewer understands log plots, the huge increases and decreases will be very obvious.I think this is important. While log scale may show more detail, if the audience doesn't understand it, then the information is useless to them."
10-1-3-2-1-1,"Exactly, there’s always constructive feedback and discussion on what can be improved or done differently on this sub, but it always comes down Ti what you’re trying to communicate and who the audience is. There’s no one plot that will cover all bases."
10-1-3-2-1-2,"True, but this technically applies to all plots. I wish more people understood how various plots work, and how to recognize poor or willfully deceptive choices in data presentation."
10-1-3-3,"I concur - I appreciate your graph as it reveals what a snake oil operation bitcoin was from the start. Reminds me of the early United States, when each bank would print their own notes and con-men would invent their own currency, allowing it to rise and crash with stupendous force."
10-1-3-3-1,Your analogy makes no sense. You fundamentally misunderstand BTC
10-1-3-3-1-1,"You're right. With crypto the con men skip the whole ""bank"" part and go right to the streets. No middlemen."
10-1-3-3-1-2,"I strongly encourage you to read a bit about the early currency history of the United States - there are very good reasons why one single, federal denominated currency was finally issued during the Civil War. Price stability matters - boom & bust cycles like this are not a force for stability, unless you advocate taxpayers bailing out crypto-oligarchs every bust cycle."
10-1-3-3-2,Right.. Thats my whole thought.. This is why you dont buy all in at the high! It still baffles me that people do this.. These are the same people that tell me I'm an idiot for buying at 18K and then get excited when it drops to 17K and buy more and then get ecstatic when I get a chance to buy in a lot at 16K! Although I'm still holding on a pretty good nest egg for 13K.. We'll see if it gets there.
10-1-3-3-3,"And then remember when they made a centralized government with a unified currency and banned all individual currencies so that they could control the currency?Then remember when the government stopped governing except to ban necessary surgeries like abortions and allowed suspicious people to mint their own online currencies?

10-1-5,There's a reason the graph was designed this way just like there is a reason that the designer chose this particular week when btc was hitting a new at the time unbelievable all time high 5 years ago.
10-2,Why not just use the actual price of Bitcoin over time?
10-2-1,"Most or over 50% of current owners are holding at a loss now so this isn't a horrible take. Or this was the case at $15,700 anyway."
10-2-1-1,So most or over 50% of current btc owners purchased their btc either precisely 60 months ago or since January 2021?
10-2-1-1-1,"Lot of these data sets cut the wallets that haven't moved coins in x years. Which you don't know if those guys lost the hard drive in 2011, have been dead ass serious about there cold storage wallet, or don't know the tax implications and at this point are too afraid to ask."
10-2-1-1-1-1,"Lol true that. I wouldn't be too surprised if 50% of all individual holders are new to the scene, but I would be very surprised if 50% of all btc is in new holders hands."
10-2-1-1-1-1-1,I would be surprised if 50% of BTC was even held collectively by a mass of individuals and not a single corporate outfit.
10-2-1-1-1-2,Or died.
10-2-1-1-1-2-1,That's one of the craziest things to me. How can you have a currency system where at any point a large amount of that money can be effectively deleted because someone with a big wallet died and never left their password. How does anyone know what coins are and aren't in circulation?
10-2-1-1-1-2-1-1,Gotta love decentralized finance huh?
10-2-1-1-1-2-1-2,"That was always part of the design, along with the upper limit on the total number of coins that can be mined. Scarcity is irrelevant for digital assets as it's trivial to just divide up the satoshis and add more decimal places."
10-2-1-1-1-2-1-4,bro havent you heard of bonkchain? its made by tying together doges. could totally solve this and world hunger
10-2-1-3,"Lol, that's not at all how this math works, you don't know the number of bitcoin owners from this chart."
10-2-1-4,"Any random fluctuating stock/asset, half the people would be up and half would be down.This statistic is not an indictment. It just shows BTC is random."
10-2-1-4-1,That's not true at all. If 90% of holders of any asset bought at the peak  that's not 50%.  No one is trying to indict anything here.
10-2-1-4-1-1,"You're an idiot, stfu and open a math or statistics or finance book."
10-2-1-4-1-1-1,"Ok so hear me out.  An asset is climbing, it reaches its peak, an all time high.  Right at that peak are you telling me 50% of owners  are in the hole and only 50% are up?"
10-2-1-5,"for an interested newbie, do you have some internet resources that they can refer to so they can begin learning about blockchain, cryptocurrency and investing in it etc etc?!"
10-2-1-5-1,I'm happy to give you some links when I'm back at work in a few weeks. What's driving your interest? It's a huge space with lots of detail.
10-2-1-5-1-1,"I am primarily interested in the cryptocurrency market and how stocks are traded there. How can anyone (like me) start investing too? I am currently pursuing CSE engineering, and I took up specialisation in blockchain technology because it fascinated me. So, I'd eventually study various fields related to it, but for now, I'd like to start somewhere, and I'd like to start with investing and stock market trading using cryptocurrency!"
10-2-2,"Looking at OP's submission history is pretty hilarious, they obviously have a strong bias against bitcoin with the amount of negative bitcoin posts they've made. This cherry picking of data is just another attempt at pushing their own narrative."
10-2-2-1,"Hard to see ""negative growth over 5 years"" as cherry picking data. If they had said ""over 4 1/3 years"", that would be cherry picking.By way of comparison, the 5 year return of the S&P 500, even after COVID and the recent downturn, is 54%."
10-2-2-1-1,"Looking at the full graph of bitcoin to usd conversion, the 5 year loss works because exactly 5 years ago there was a relatively small surge in bitcoin price. It will shortly switch back once the 2018 spike goes back down"
10-2-2-1-1-1,*Just a few more years until Bitcoin is taken seriously.*
10-2-2-1-2,"Picking a 5 year time frame is kind of cherry picking. ""if I bought x at the all time high I'd be in the negative right now!"""
10-2-2-1-2-1,"People are misunderstanding this graph. Each point reflects the net gain or loss you'd have made if you'd bought bitcoin 5 years before *that point*. So there is no real ""starting point"". The peaks on the graph represent 5-year-periods of net gain."
10-2-2-1-2-1-1,Something is not adding up then. Bitcoin was at 67k sometime in 2020 or was it 2021? Thats 3 times higher than the previous max price.
10-2-2-1-2-1-1-1,"Just from a cursory look at the price history on the google chart, March 12, 2021 hits $61,280 USD, where the point 5 years ish prior is March 11, 2016 at $410 USD. (61280-410)/410 * 100% ~= 15,000% change, which corresponds to part of the 2021 hump on OPs graph. As some other commenters mention a log y axis would prob be better, but the data seems fine. You might just be misinterpreting it."
10-2-2-1-2-2,"A lot of index funds are measured 1, 3, 5 and 10 year returns (Vanguard also has month end, 3 month, YTD, and since inception).  5 years isn’t cherry picking as it’s a pretty standard investment period for longer term investments.  Though to be thorough they could have included the others as well."
10-2-2-1-4,"Ah yes, it is totally normal to select the only week from 2009 to 2020, literally the only week during that time period, where BTC was over the current price?That doesn't seem a LITTLE odd to you?"
10-2-2-1-5,It is because in about 4 months this chart will look very different. He's cherry picking an exact day/week it peaked and using a chart that's inherently 5 years in the past.
10-2-2-2,Reality has a strong bias against Bitcoin
10-2-2-2-1,"Bitcoin has spent a longer time UNDER the current price point, than it has above. But sure, if you cherrypick time frames, everything can be a bad investment."
10-2-2-2-1-1,You do see that the graph shows every posible time of 5y return right?
10-2-2-2-1-1-1,"Bitcoin has been around for 14 years and the graph start at an exact point 5 years ago where there was a price surge, bitcoin has indeed spent more of its time below the current price than above so at most price points it a net positive, so this start date and timeframe are just cherry picked to create a negative return outcome. Had OP picked a price dip 5 years ago, or most points 6, 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 or 14 years before it'd be a net positive."
10-2-2-2-1-1-1-1,"Please also go the other way bruv. 1,2,3,4,5 give a very diffrent picture. *Especially* 1 year returns right now. It's -65%Bitcoin is a highly speculative volatile asset. Nothing more."
10-2-2-2-1-1-1-2,"It’s extremely common to view stock returns in year to date, last twelve months, or last 3/5 years timeframes, because, for instance:1. Most of the investors have not bought the thing when it launched2. The chosen timeframe might have some key phenomenon which impact you want to focus on3. The timeframe does *not* have some key phenomenon which might impact the dataIt’s a perfectly valid thing to say that 5-year returns of something are negative. You *can* counter that by saying that “yeah but the ten year returns are not!” but that’s besides the point.But! Just because 5-year returns are negative, is doesn’t make something a bad investment. Analysing returns always needs to include the context."
10-2-2-2-1-1-1-3,"Or even 4 or 3. The graph also is pretty useless, since it isn’t logarithmic and every realistic return looks like a flat line. (Say between -100% and 1000%)"
10-2-2-2-2,Yet somehow it still survives.
10-2-2-2-2-1,"Same way Amway, Herbalife, LuLuRoe, Arbonne, etc. are all still in business..."
10-2-2-2-2-2,there will always be another sucker holding the bag. literally dumbfucks made it their call to arms to hold the bag
10-2-2-3,>This cherry picking of dataHow's that exactly?
10-2-2-3-1,Because he's picked a peak value as the starting date. It's the only date between 2011 and 2020 where if you'd bought bitcoin you'd currently be down. Its pretty obvious if you just look at the price graph.
10-2-2-3-1-1,"Well, not the only date, but basically the only week.  It was that high for about 3-5 days."
10-2-2-4,Im making a post on the actual price of bitcoin because this is a stupid misleading graph
10-2-2-5,When Bitcoin hits $100k in a couple of years I'm betting this guy ain't posting much
10-2-3,It’s hardly dataisbeautiful worthy as it is. A straight graph of price would be even more laughably appropriate
10-2-4,"I'm interested in showing the effect of long term holding. That used to show jaw dropping returns, but not so much at the moment."
10-2-4-1,"Obviously, you chose a peak value as a starting point."
10-2-4-1-1,"the idea is that for the first time, holding bitcoin for 5 years has resulted in a net loss. previously anyone that held for a maximum of 4 years would have been in profit."
10-2-4-1-1-1,"The point is that in a couple weeks, that would no longer be the case again, because OP waited until ""5 years ago"" was a peak period."
10-2-4-1-1-1-1,"In a couple weeks, it will likely be even worse, or not much better. It's silly to think that these losses will be erased that quickly even by the most bullish estimates."
10-2-4-1-1-1-2,All of you pointing this are missing the fact that the peak is relevant because that's when many people chose to invest for the first time due to the fast growth rate at the time.
10-2-4-1-1-1-2-1,"I must disagree; that's not a fact, but an opinion. Some people fomo in at peaks, others feel that they missed the train and back away, and there's no way to know what proportion of them existed for a particular peak 5 years ago. Even if I fully accept your premise, why should this particular peak be the one to be considered?"
10-2-4-1-2,I think you misunderstood this graph. It's not using the starting point as a reference like most financial graphs.
10-2-4-1-2-1,"It starting point is 5 years ago, which happens to be a peak of December 2017."
10-2-4-1-2-1-1,"No. It's starting point is effectively 10 years ago. The first point shows you that if you bought bitcoin in 2012 and sold in 2017, you'd have made a very large profit. And so on. There is no cherry picking, it's just not the most intuitive graph."
10-2-4-1-2-1-1-1,"No. Thats what it says it is doing,  but it cant be. If you look at jan 21 your 5 year return would have been 100x...."
10-2-4-1-2-1-2,"So how is it misleading? I remember at the time people saying that even if you bought at the peak and it crashes, you can just wait a couple years, maybe 5 tops and you'll be back in the black. We can now see that wasn't true. For most of bitcoins history even if you bought right before a crash, you would still have incredible returns if you held for 5 years, but as of now that's finally not true, and more broadly speaking bitcoin has settled into more ""reasonable"" returns. That's what the graph shows and what OP put in the title, what's misleading?"
10-2-4-1-2-1-2-1,"> I remember at the time people saying that even if you bought at the peak and it crashes, you can just wait a couple years, maybe 5 tops and you'll be back in the black. We can now see that wasn't trueErr it is true though. It surpassed the peak from five years ago within five years.So people who bought at that peak were in the black, they're just in the red again (assuming they held)"
10-2-4-1-2-1-2-2,"Bitcoin has had 3 bull runs in it's history, peaking in 2013, 2017, and 2021, and after each bull run it's value has fallen 80-90%. If all you knew about btc was that 5 years ago it cost more than it does on this specific day, you would consider it a huge failure. But if someone told you that if you purchased it 4 years ago it would be worth 400%+ today and that was all you knew about it then you would consider btc to be a huge success. Or if you purchased it 6 years ago it would be worth ~1500% today. Would you consider that single data point misleading if you chose 4 or 6 years ago as your comparison rather than the tippy top of a huge bull run 5 years ago?In general, a 5 year comparison is extremely stupid to make as btc has been in a 4 year cycle since it was developed. If this graph were on a 4 year timeline it would be closer to meaning something. Even if you make your purchasing point 5 years and one month or 4 years and 11 months ago, you'd still be very profitable today."
10-2-4-1-2-1-2-3,If you bought at 5 years old peak you're now about +30% in USD.
10-2-4-1-2-1-2-4,It’s misleading because he’s personally invested and feels like he’s being attacked.
10-2-4-1-2-1-3,"I don’t think that is the meaning of this graph.I think the x axis is the end of a hypothetical 5-year ending period and the y axis is the change is value from starting at 5 years before the date on the x axis.So, the “start” of the chart has no special meaning.  The data at any point wouldn’t change if you extended the x axis forward or backward (except forward we have no data and backward can only go to date of BTC creation + 5 years."
10-2-4-1-3,The entire point is that he chose 5 years of starting points to show the effect of long term holding…
10-2-4-1-4,5 years ago wasn’t BTC’s peak value.
10-2-4-1-4-1,A peak value
10-2-4-1-4-1-1,"Well no, because we see values above 0% right away. If it was a peak, we would see the value dip before it rose again."
10-2-4-1-4-1-1-2,"That happened, it's a 2 second job to Google it and look, and it's maybe the most common knowledge for anyone with even a passing interest in the subject."
10-2-4-1-4-2,Oh is that so? Go and actually look what was 5 years ago.
10-2-4-1-4-2-1,I just did - BTC was at 12.8k 5 years ago. It was 64K in 2021 though
10-2-4-1-4-2-1-2,December 2017 was a peak value point. It went to a high of 17k before losing about 85% of it's value after which it regained 4 years later to a new peak value of 69k. Pick any point surrounding December 2017 to buy BTC and you would still be quite profitable.
10-2-4-1-4-2-1-3,How do you call it when it was $12.8k 5 years ago and $7k 4 years 11 months and 5 years 1 months ago?
10-2-4-2,The comparison table of Bitcoin vs gold vs the S&P 500 on  is a much better way to visualize returns based on # of years of holding.
10-2-4-2-1,That's a really interesting site. Though I'm not sure that the data really makes the case for Bitcoin anymore...
10-2-4-2-1-1,"price doesn't necessarily say anything about the protocol itself. its value proposition is the same. it is still just as secure. if you live in a country with an unstable economy/authoritarian regime, bitcoin is a godsend."
10-2-4-2-1-1-1,"But in that case why not bch or monero?Seems like for actual use bitcoin isn’t great, but for speculation it when’s out."
10-2-4-2-1-1-1-1,Bitcoin is the most secure store of value. There are other coins for anonymity and speed etc
10-2-4-2-1-2,I think it's rather obvious you only see it as an investment scam lol.
10-2-4-2-1-3,I think the case is.. don't put all your eggs in one basket.. Diversify your portfolio based on your level of acceptable risk. People who dont buy bitcoin now are like the ones who whined about how it was a scam in 2019 and then cried people got lucky when those that did buy sold at a substantial profit. Now they're whining again when people are buying BACK in ready to buy again when it once again soars.
10-2-4-2-1-3-1,"I think at this point it's pretty clear that BTC is primarily a speculative investment. It's not functioning as a currency. Buying BTC is essentially a form of gambling, with no fundamental basis, so very few investors should consider it acceptable risk. The problem is ""advocates"" that want to pretend it's basically guaranteed 10x in 10 years and market it as such to people who are less informed. That is pretty much the definition of a scam."
10-2-4-2-1-3-1-1,"It's functioning fine as a currency. There are countries where Bitcoin is being adopted as a currency and you can use it to pay at stores, restaurants, etc."
10-2-4-2-1-3-1-2,"So you see no need for a politically neutral reserve asset that can be used as pristine collateral with no counter party risk and an asset that can be securely stored, transported instantly, and one who’s entire supply and transactional history can be individually audited and verified?Gold has fulfilled that role for hundreds of years and is the foundation of all our currencies, even to this day, and bitcoin is a major improvement on all of gold’s monetary functions…but it’s probably scam."
10-2-4-2-1-3-2,Bitcoin works for the same reason NFTs work and a whole slew of other predictive buying: It's all about not being the last person holding it while also trading it for the highest price possible.
10-2-4-3,Breaking news: if you buy the top and sell the bottom then you won't be successful in investing
10-2-4-4,Long term? Why not 10 years than?
10-2-4-5,Short term is 5 years and under typically for investments.
10-2-5,Word. This data is not beautiful at all. /r/mildlyinfuriating
10-3,This is a roundabout way of saying that the price of bitcoin is lower today than 12/16/2017. But if you had bought any time between 12/18/2017 and \~Nov 2020 you'd still be in the green today. A simple price chart will show this more clearly.
10-3-1,"This graph shows much more than you describe. It shows whether a person who held for 5 years would be up or down on any given date, not just today."
10-3-1-1,If they bought in once and sold on that day.
10-3-2,"I wanted to emphasize the staggeringly large returns that early buyers/miners experienced, the modest returns after that, and today's negative number. That last one is admittedly hard to see. A log scale could have made it clearer at the expense of minimizing the first point."
10-3-2-1,Anyone involved in a ponzi scheme does well if they're in early.
10-3-2-1-2,You either have no fucking clue what a Ponzi scheme is or you have no idea a what Bitcoin is.
10-4,"A bit misleading. December 2017 was the peak of bitcoin's first run-up, so 5 years ago today was a very bad time to buy. You'd be positive if you bought at any other point in time before November 2020"
10-4-1,First run up? Huh? Bitcoin used to be worth under a penny.
10-4-1-1,"I missed the run up to $1, but I was there for the run up to $8 and the run up to $30. Yet somehow I avoided making millions :("
10-4-1-1-2,"Had some crypto in coin base (like eth, nothing valued near BTC) and I left the account and forgot about it. Have my login info but it now has a 2fa attached to it that I never set up, but the password is the same. Either someone stole it and they're dumb enough to not change the password, or coin base stole it...wonder which one it is /sEdit - binance, not Coinbase"
10-4-1-1-3,"You’ll be saying the same thing in 2040, 2050, 2060. That is unless you have some now…"
10-4-2,"I concur. Extremely misleading, but an entertaining graph."
10-4-3,IIRC that was right after they mentioned it on Big Bang Theory. I know because I sold all I had for a tidy profit at that time.
10-4-4,"Yeah, I bought $160 BTC in 2016 and it's worth ~$2,000 today."
10-4-5,"November 2020 was over 2 years ago, it's really not that misleading."
10-5,Data is beautiful. This chart is not. That y axis needs some serious work
11,"Crypto has never existed through a global recession before. All bets are off, and we might be about to see the first *true* crypto crash - and it might knock the wind out of even the hardest hodlers.I’m seeing far too much chatter from people who are a.) sure we are entering a 2 year bear market and others who are b.) sure this is just a dip in an extended cycle."
11-1,"I already count everything i have in crypto as lost, so bring it the fuck on, let it burn."
11-1-2,It's certainly a good strategy to detach yourself emotionally when you drop into the negative. Can't lose something that is already lost *taps forehead*
11-1-2-1,"Bruh I joined last year in March, close to the crash and bought near the top. I came to make quick money because crypto was so hot, but I soon realised the reality of investing. I'm down 50% and I don't give a shit rn.You come to make a quick buck and end up becoming a long time investor. It's been the reality for many holders like me so we'll fucking HODL cause what do you have to lose anyway?"
11-1-2-1-1,"Yep. Same. I'm just gonna hold for years, regardless of what happens. Maybe in 10 years my investments turned into some gains."
11-1-2-1-1-1,... or it could be zero
11-1-2-1-1-1-1,"It could. But that would change absolutely nothing about my life. Sure it would hurt to lose the money but like I said, it wouldn't change anything."
11-1-2-1-1-2,"Same here. Crypto has been a place to ""play"" with some money.I haven't looked at my holdings for a couple months and I don't plan on it for years. Just forgetting about it."
11-1-2-1-1-3,not maybe...it will.   Its not a quick buck but a long grind.
11-1-2-1-1-3-1,"Crypto is a long game, play safely and reap rewards in time"
11-1-2-1-2,"""What do you have to lose anyway""Your remaining 50%"
11-1-2-1-2-1,ITT: new investors who think they are “long term” by ignoring principles of sunk cost. How long did it take for you guys to be up 50%?
11-1-2-1-3,Sounds like you’re rationalizing inability to accept sink cost.
11-1-2-1-5,"I entered in May last year, so I went a few months watching my investment's value disappear. When I entered I had already made up my mind I was in it for the long haul. Can't agree more. I haven't invested money that I need to live from, so I will HODL because my mindset hasn't changed on why I invested, what I invested in and the value I think it will achieve in the future."
11-1-2-2,I’ve never actually seen positive so it doesn’t really hurt
11-1-2-3,"I own currency. I own exactly what I did a month ago, a little more actually."
11-1-2-5,"the strategy is to educate the fuck out of yourself. the USD is going to fail in our lifetime, the printing is too ridiculous. the world needs a unit of currency that isn't tied to some JPOW a-hole with a money printer. countries are forced to buy USD/CAD/YUAN/EURO to issue their own currency, they're not going to accept this power being centralized. BTC is the ONLY alternative out there for a global system and it works. once it's big enough, it can't be manipulated and the majority of the volatility will subside. the only way you will hodl through a nuclear crypto winter is by understanding the inevitability of it. this isn't speculation anymore, there will 100% be a shift away from fiat to cyrpto-based currencies in our lifetime, and BTC is by far the best bet for the coin. sleep tight and hodl on, crypto is entering the age of scarcity, i DGAF what happens the next 2-4 years. BTC is here and permanent. it survived mt. gox, it's going to survive a recession."
11-1-2-5-1,I think like this as well. I am not as deep into the matter as you are but can you explain to me why BTC for example can't be manipulated once it's big enough? What about whales. Someone who owns so much BTC that he can manipulate the price is extremely powerful and dangerous? Or how do you see this?
11-1-2-5-1-1,"It can't be manipulated to the effect it is today, as many ""whales"" will divest. The Winklevoss twins are in their 40s, they're the biggest known holders. I doubt we'll see them keep 90+% of their wealth in crypto their whole lives. Over time, BTC will become more distributed, and you can already see that BTC is far less volatile than it was last halving, which was far less volatile than the previous one. Like the stock market, there will always be manipulation, but it's harder to do when it's 10+ trillion dollars."
11-1-3,"Same, even with the stock market I feel the same"
11-1-3-1,I do the same.  Once I invest that money is gone.
11-1-3-1-2,"That's how I feel when I buy a lottery ticket, not when I'm investing."
11-1-3-1-2-2,Same thing these days
11-1-3-1-3,That's not investing then. That's speculating. I'd highly recommend reading The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham (the guy who mentored Warren Buffet). It's a good basic primer on safe investing.
11-1-3-1-3-1,Investing in crypto is speculating.
11-1-3-1-4,"That doesn’t make sense. It’s gone forever? You never hope to use it to raise your standard of living, or retirement?"
11-1-3-1-4-1,"No, it’s gone until I reach my goal."
11-1-4,"Yep. This is also my ouook, as soon as I press that buy button it's money that I will NEVER see back. And if by some miracle, I do, I use it to buy even more crypto because that's essentially fake money now. (Lol. You get what I'm saying)"
11-1-4-2,Just some numbers on the screen
11-1-5,....SO on brand for a hodler.
11-2,"I dont need the money i invested, although i would be sad if i lost it. But i will not sell. Like i said, i dont need the money and i hate working. If there is a 0.01% chance of me to retire early, that's outweighs the 99.99% chance of it all going to zero. And it's not even close."
11-2-1,"I'll be sad too, because against the rationality at the end of the day I am overinvested, but my life still won't end, or go down the drain if this investment goes to nothing"
11-2-1-1,"What if you take a pause for a couple months. The money you usually invest save it, wouldn't that ""average down"" your overinvesment ratio with your capital till you are not over invested?"
11-2-1-1-1,"maybe, but I look at it as a habit of going to the gym - once you start skipping, you eventually give up on the idea altogetherI've got into thinking about personal finances, and how I need to form a certain amount of capital while I am capable of working, and thus far trying to stick to the plan - with temporary corrections, as I got started wrongalmost done covering cc debt, just two months left, then forming a 3 months financial pillow, and after that should be on track to diversification, with long term bonds and crypto, maybe etfs at some pointjust controlling the amounts spent, and averaging only on a fixed set of assets, proportionally"
11-2-1-1-1-1,"Except now it's not so much ""going to gym"" as it is ""smoking crack""."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1,The thing about crack is it's very moreish.
11-2-1-2,"It won't end, but you can lose years of progress with a single market crash. That's why we invest what we can afford to lose"
11-2-1-2-1,Risk vs reward
11-2-2,"Same as you, everything I've invested is considered gone already.Don't get me wrong, I'd be devastated if it went to zero but I'd be no worse off."
11-2-2-1,"Exactly, i considered it lost the moment i've invested. If it goes to zero i'll cry a couple of days in the shower and then move on with my life."
11-2-2-1-1,"As someone who’s lost a lot of money in the past, you will never stop thinking about it. 10 years from now you’ll be looking at a car or something pricy and just think ‘fuck…’"
11-2-2-1-1-1,Let the sheltered live their lives. These people have no idea what hard times are
11-2-2-1-2,That’s not an investment then that’s a gamble. An investment is supposed to have return
11-2-2-1-2-1,Yes and i'll wait for that return. Im not saying i wont take profits. But this thread isnt about taking profits  its about selling because of a crash. And im not interested in selling at a loss.
11-2-2-2,Me too! My wife would roast me to hell but life would go on as usual. We’re not going to zero but could BTC see the teens again? I think it’s possible
11-2-3,"I'm sorry, but this mentality is literally the same mentality as someone who plays the lottery lol. This ""there are astronomically small chances of me winning here and a much higher chance of me losing it all, but there's still a chance so I'll take it"" just doesn't make much sense to me"
11-2-3-1,They call the lottery a 'tax on stupid people' for a reason.
11-2-3-2,So you're saying there's a chance..
11-2-4,"If an asset goes 90% down it needs 1000% to break even. If you understand this simple math, you know what to do... but for some strange reason 99.9999999% people on this sub - dosent."
11-2-4-1,While that's true you also need to remember that the lower a market cap goes the less money it then takes for it to rebound so there is a cancelling out effect.
11-2-4-2,"So what? That's the sort of maths that sounds significant, but isn't really"
11-2-4-2-1,"This. It's pretty sensationalist when someone says ""it takes more percentage wise to recover when an asset falls by this percentage."" It's like gerrymandering but for finance "
11-2-4-2-2,care to elaborate?
11-2-4-2-2-1,I believe what they’re saying is that it’s less about the percent and more about market cap. $1 liquidated is the same $1 to recover.
11-2-4-2-2-1-1,"Yep. I made a post about it a while ago. If I knew got to find and link it, I will, although you don't really need to read it, it's not that revolutionary. I just posted at the time when I had a realisation about it myself, and a bunch of people agreed. So yeah, even with smaller numbers, people always say oh, if something drops 50% then it had to increase by 100% or double, to get back to the same point. Which is true in terms of percentage, but the number of units at a given price is exactly the same. Sure, you'll make a lot more money if you buy after a 90% drop but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's any harder to get back to that price, market conditions permitting."
11-2-4-3,More like fake percentage math - sounds simple but is just being twisted for false arguments.If an asset goes down $1 it needs to go up $1 to break even. The actual value is what people assign to it. Percentages make things look skewed but they aren't.
11-2-4-3-1,"This doesn’t make any sense. That “$1 to break even” could represent a 1,000,000% increase in price. Perfect example: Luna was at $140 at one point, but if it goes up by just one dollar I’ll be a trillionaire. Percentages don’t skew, they are truth."
11-2-4-3-1-1,"Rise and fall percentages do look imbalanced.Let say starting at 10$ if its down 10% then its down 1$. So its now valued at 9$.For it to ""recover"" back the 1$ , 9$ needs to rise 11.11111% for it to go back to 10$.But it both just rise and fall for 1$."
11-2-4-4,"+1000% is literally what BTC did every bear market recovery. If anything can go up 10x, it’s bitcoin at the bottom of the bear market."
11-2-4-5,Lol 1000% is nothing for crypto. The markets it’s taking share from are huge. And honestly it’s barely started wether people believe that or not.
11-2-5,But what if you had a higher chance of retiring early by investing / DCA-ing into more traditional assets like stocks or real estate. Would you still proceed with this same plan with crypto?
11-3,So you saying superb buying opportunities amirite?
11-3-1,Perfect time to continue to DCa
11-3-1-1,"Yup dca is always the best strat in a crash, but like this guy be saying. People lose their jobs and whatnot. It’s a privilege to be able to invest in a crash."
11-3-1-1-1,"Yup, that’s why the savvy rich get richer from crashes. The world goes on sale for those with assets"
11-3-2,This is what DCA was meant for
11-3-3,"Even better for me if it stays low for a while, because I just don't have a ton of spare money right now to invest"
11-4,"If people think this is a ""dip"" in an extended cycle then I don't know what to say, we've been in a bear market for 8 months, how on earth can people still debate this."
11-4-1,If we just keep debating for months on end the bear market will end and we will be in the bull market before we have to accept it’s been a bear market the entire time
11-4-1-1,That’s exactly what happened last time when BTC was at 3K. Everyone here was too scared to touch it because they thought crypto was dead or at least going to 1K btc.
11-4-2,"Basically there are people who think this is a bear market (correct) arguing with people who believe crypto's macro trend measured on a multi-year basis is positive (also correct).Whether crypto is up or down is largely a function of what you're using as your start date.  Ultimately, I think the real interesting question is this:  In 2030, will crypto be a bigger or smaller asset class than it is today?  Is it going to zero, or going to 10x?  Today's price vs. 6 months ago price is irrelevant to that question.  I love crypto, and even I'm open to both as potential outcomes as relates to crypto: the asset class."
11-4-3,8 months? ETH and BTC both hit ATH's 6 months ago.
11-4-4,Because crypto doesn’t produce any cash flow nor dividend? You can’t value the price at any given moment because it produces nothing? You don’t own anything except a medium of exchange that people pretend is an investable asset? Because it’s basically a giant game of pump and dump based on virtually zero tangible information about the underlying asset and purely based on random technical price movement? Those are just a few.
11-4-4-1,"Its a bear market, it is that simple."
11-4-5,"We’ve been in a bear market for 8 months but that doesn’t mean we are about to go lower. We are about to be in a recession, you think crypto is going to keep going sideways in a recession? That would be amazing but people who need $ will sell and the price will get lower. I will continue to hold and dca"
11-5,So you are saying better discounts are possible? Shut up and take my fiat
11-5-1,Wait for the 99% discount
11-5-1-1,Unless its Luna.
11-5-1-3,Some of my coins are already at this discount
11-5-2,Time to mine more fiat *puts on McDonald’s hat*
11-5-2-1,"Sir, this is a Wendy's..."
11-5-2-1-1,Dammit Kevin!
11-5-3,Do you have a FIAT?
11-5-3-1,Where can I buy FIAT token?
11-5-3-1-1,"At the McDonalds checkout, costs a few hours of your time."
11-5-3-1-2,Usdt is on there somewhere.... jk please no one buy this scam.
11-5-3-1-2-1,It’s true though.
11-5-3-2,If you only eat ramen..
11-5-4,"Everyone is worried crypto will go to zero, but my real concern is that fiat will."
11-5-4-1,"I’m less worried about the numbers, and more just about the general trend toward feudalism."
11-5-4-1-1,That’s the real worry
11-5-4-1-2,Swearing fealty to your lord is tight!
11-5-4-2,"Theres no government backing for bitcoin. Odds are bitcoin would before fiat. I don't like it, but it's true"
12,Bitcoin under 20k
12-1,Welcome everyone from r/all! --> POWER TO THE PLAYERS 
12-1-1,ETH under $1k
12-1-2,"This is forum sliding, and IRRELEVANT to GME"
12-1-2-1,LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACKTHIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR STOCK. Where is the quality control bot? I came into the comments specifically to downvote the bot comment. Why isn’t it on this post?
12-2,I can’t believe going all in on GME last year is saving me from the shit we’re seeing now
12-2-1,It saved me. Would have blown my entire wad on crypto
12-2-1-1,I got such heavy bags on LRC though lol. Ouch.
12-2-1-1-1,Only got 300 but thought I bought the dip then it kept dipping lol. I'll stick to GME in future
12-2-1-1-1-1,"I'm waiting for Tether to collapse before buying into crypto, but not until after GME moons.Edit: but obviously, I'll continue to buy and DRS GME even after MOASS."
12-2-1-1-1-1-1,I bought some lrc and this is my plan.
12-2-1-1-1-1-2,This is my plan. I’m salivating at some of these crypto prices.  Definitely ready for GME to explode.
12-2-1-1-1-1-3,Short tether on margin.
12-2-1-1-1-1-3-1,"I'll pass on infinite risk, thank you very much. But going long on an undervalued stock with a stellar balance sheet which is transitioning into tech with focus on web3, count me in!"
12-2-1-1-1-1-4,"Honestly thought it would be what people would turn too, but gold rules all In a depression"
12-2-1-1-1-1-4-1,It's possible that gold is also in a bubble...
12-2-1-1-1-2,"yah, I have less than 200 in LRC and ETH combined.  Figured they might do well when Gamestop launches the marketplace."
12-2-1-1-1-3,"I completely hear ya but we're still early. Right now is a great time to load up imo...if Loopring gets a cut for every transaction on the marketplace, they're gonna rise significantly"
12-2-1-1-1-4,"Same-ish. I bought a few hundred LRC and IMX. IMX hasn't completely crapped the bed from where I bought in, but my LRC bags hurt.I don't plan on selling either any time in the near future, because both have actual use cases so I'm sure they'll rebound eventually. But I am now aware that I am apparently much worse at picking entry points for crypto than I am with GME."
12-2-1-1-1-5,"Hooboy, I dropped a bit into LRC when I opened my Gamestop Wallet--checked it today and ouch! I figure it'll recover though, the whole financial world is bleeding out right now."
12-2-1-1-2,Same but at least it’s not a shit coin
12-2-1-1-2-1,"Aye, true, true"
12-2-1-1-2-1-1,"I mean, we knew this crypto winter was coming…these massive sell-offs were predicted from the beginning. I don’t think I ever really expected BTC under $20k, or ETH under $1000, but I also don’t think this is the bottom.One thing that’s been reassuring is LRC has been gaining ranking spots on CoinMarketCap while everything’s falling, and the magnitude of its drops have been getting less drastic as the top coins have been falling."
12-2-1-1-2-2,Is it not?
12-2-1-1-2-3,"Oh youll be fine haha, this is nothing wait for the 100k > 20k bear market in a few years or the 1M > 100k one later"
12-2-1-1-3,Yep
12-2-1-1-4,"i wouldnt say LRC are bags.  Its just a longer play ( if your trying to make money from them as an investment). i think once people figure out what loopring is and how it works. the price will climb. your not wrong, just early.I figured i should buy some LRC just incase. Plus its what i use to send people NFTS for free and what not. So i have them more for utility at this point. Price doesnt matter to much to me right now because its so early. Heck 5 years from now LRC could be 5$ or 500$ a coin. Only person who might know is DFV,  becuase he is a time travler lol"
12-2-1-1-4-1,"What is the play. What are the lrc tokens you are buying needed for though?Not trying to troll or anything, genuinely curious why I would buy it over ethereum"
12-2-1-1-4-1-1,"LRC is used to pay gas on the Loopring network, similar to how ETH is used to pay gas on the Ethereum network. Loopring is a Layer-2 solution, which basically means it's a chain built on top of Ethereum. Why use it? It has *much* cheaper fees while being able to do all of the same things and maintaining an acceptable amount of security. There are other L2s of course but LRC is partnered with GME so everyone here likes it more than the other L2s. You would want to buy it over Ethereum for investment purposes because the potential gains would be much higher, given the lesser current adoption and therefore a greater amount of future adoption, and the fact that it's much smaller cap so there's more potential in the market cap multiplying. That also does mean it carries more risk than Ethereum, which already carries quite a bit of risk in and of itself."
12-2-1-1-4-1-1-3,"Im not 100% sure on this, bur they are deflationary aswell. You burn part of them for transactions (or something, i forgot) and there will be fewer and fewer of them over longer period of time. Again, im not 100% sure on this, someone with more knowledge correct me if im wrong; also if you invest significant $$ do your research."
12-2-1-1-4-1-2,"I use them for Minting and gas fees to send people NFTs.  Im  using them now because ETH has dropped 37% over the last 7 days  and LRC has only dropped 29%. So i feel like when i buy the coins they hold the value a little better than ETH right now. ( to me personally, i could be dead wrong lol) I dont have a lot of money so when i can actually afford to put in the 100$, i buy LRC and use it for that reason."
12-2-1-1-4-1-3,They're used as a utility coin. You can easily go and read all about it in their blogs on their website. The value of the coin comes from the utility behind it and the underlying technology or coding loopring has built.
12-2-1-1-4-1-3-1,"I think Gamestop is just one use case of what loopring wants to do. If Gamestop is able to host other creators NFTs, big brand names and the like, others will want to do the same with their own wallets and their own markets unoffiliated with their competitors. If Gamestop succeeds, loopring can use that to spread out to other spaces, which will bring more utility to their coin."
12-2-1-1-4-1-3-2,"Correct, I think a lot of people don't get this part. It's a protocol, so they could easily expand past GME in the future with other companies. With that said, I still don't think we've seen the big bang yet with what they can do with their protocol"
12-2-1-1-4-2,"Loopring is a huge step forward but as it is a layer 2 solution alone it is only a step, not a leap. What is needed is a layer 1 that can live up to Looprings promise and Eth ain't it."
12-2-1-1-4-2-1,just read this morning daniel wang ( the creator of loopring) was working on a project to bring Dapps from L1 to L2.  Is that what your talking about?
12-2-1-1-4-2-1-1,"That is cool! But no, I am talking about a need to move away from Eth altogether.I work in crypto and although there are many Eth maxis, I hold the firm belief that Eth is doomed to fail due to its governance issues.My work is building a complete new PoW ecosystem, that runs fully on cell phones and IoT devices, with no miner or staking class. Every user looks after their own data, no third parties are involved and something that Loopring would be most welcome on - but we won't be in mainnet until later this year.So I hope that the current set up is not the final form for Loopring and they move away from Eth to a blockchain that will be more stable in the long run. I would love if that were the one I work for, but I would be equally ecstatic if they were able to build their own sovereign layer 1!"
12-2-1-1-4-3,"This is how I see it too, and I bought a big chunk in Oct/Nov of 2021 when it was over $3  I thought it would go higher eventually then, and I still do. Silly me not factoring in the crash we all saw coming honestly. Between that and the time Web 3 will need to establish itself im not worried. I averaged down a bit and kept buying GME, it will all work out in the end!"
12-2-1-1-4-4,"""It's just a longer play""That's bagholder talk.  If you were up 50%, even if you planned on holding long, you wouldn't be saying that.I'm a bagholder too.  Loading up the bags since $100 buys you 300 LRC.  But still, bagholder."
12-2-1-1-4-4-1,"Im using the coins, i prefer them cheaper lol. im not holding them to make money on them. thats the diffrence. i know they will go up sooner or later. If the price was to high right now i wouldnt be able to do what im doing.does that make sense? im awful at explaining myself lol"
12-2-1-1-4-5,Cryptospace already knows what it is and how it works though. Pretty sure you don’t even need to ever have lrc to even use zkrollups either so the lrc token is iirc pointless.
12-2-1-1-4-5-1,"With the 100 i put in  before memorial day weekend to activate mine. I was able to activate 2 more (my wife and sisters) wallets, and mint and give out about 700+ NFTs on the sub. I was messing around trying to figure out how to mint an NFT.I made my cat avi guy and asked if anyone wanted it and i ran out of the 100 i made in like an hour. So i minted another 100, then those ran out lol and So on until i ran out. Now with that new Powell video out about the fed wanting a digital currency, my first thought was fuck that. Then it hit me"" be your own bank""  Im not really holding them to make money i guess. I have them to use them. I seen all those empty Gamestop wallets and thought i dont need that 100$ in coins. These empty wallets need a DRS CAT in them lol."
12-2-1-1-5,Same :D except my cost basis is way above what it is now so nice and easy to average down
12-2-1-1-5-1,"I was gonna average down, but thought it might be throwing good money after bad. So now I just buy more GME :)"
12-2-1-1-5-1-2,I should probably do the same..
12-2-1-1-5-1-2-1,depends on your time horizon. crypto bear market for next 2 years in all likelihood. so i DRS
12-2-2,Dude thank to GME I sleep like a baby. I don't have to worry about inflation (13.9% here) and my country shit currency (I'm literally 15% up just from our currency devaluation). GME position is basicaly my bank acount and I'm 100% in.
12-2-2-1,"Lmao same. I bought GME (GS2C) last year a lot during march-august, when 1€ was around 1.2$. Now 1€ is nearly 1$, but i got to buy more for the same amount lol."
12-2-3,"Good to you my friend, GME probably saved soo many apes from doing bad with criypto."
12-2-4,Sold my sp500 last year for gme. I thought I was crazy at the time but it paid off lol
12-2-5,"Same, sold all my BTC at 58k and went all in GME around 145 a little later. Working out pretty ok so far."
12-3,Everyone thought last Monday was going to be bloody Monday but it's going to be every Monday for the next 6 months lol
12-3-1,Not this Monday though - markets closed
12-3-1-1,crypto never closes..
12-3-1-1-1,"Oh it’s trying to close! No wait is that the hedgies? Screw it, Ken your a right bastard, hodl, drs, and enjoy the ride… where’s my ramen?"
12-3-1-1-2,"and perhaps people will learn how to short, and then btfd with the dry powder on the sidelines(short the pumps from 53)"
12-3-1-1-2-1,53?
12-3-1-1-2-1-1,"53k is when ***I*** turned bearish and started to short the rallies .. again, this is just me.closing a few positions at 17k and then see where the majority of the markets go13k-15k could be a good long-term position .. imho"
12-3-1-2,"Oh no, we'll just have to have a bloody Tuesday then "
12-3-1-3,Why closed
12-3-1-3-1,Black Monday

12-3-2,"People expect bitcoin to shoot up, it's kinda of hard if there is an energy crisis. Bitcoin needs energy to live, the higher price of energy the less likely bitcoin will survive."
12-3-2-1,I also mean the entire stock market at large
12-3-2-1-1,I sell servers to fortune 100 trading companies. The sheer amount of power needed to run their companies is astronomical. It really makes me laugh at the bitcoin “needing energy” comment
12-3-2-1-1-1,"The ""BTC is bad for the environment"" bullshit is unadulterated FUD stemming from a ""study"" where the author over-extrapolated from the available data."
12-3-2-1-1-1-1,"Do you have any understanding of how bitcoin actually works?An insane amount of compute power is used in the network, this has an associated huge power cost with associated environmental impact."
12-3-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Yes, yes I do. Probably better than you lolEven your comment hints at a  between ***energy*** (""power"") and electricity. And I was talking about the study that was published in Nature."
12-3-2-1-1-2,"I'm wasn't making a comparison. I'm sure other companies that rely on huge power consumption will struggle to shoot back up in terms of stock value as making profits will be hard.The only difference is, bitcoin is decentralized, it can continue to live as long as someone is active. Companies will pull the plug if company loses too much"
12-3-2-1-1-2-1,"No, because companies have more to worry about application wise than just trading systems"
12-3-2-1-1-2-1-1,"That's fine. I'm sure you are correct, how ever I was focused mostly on bit coin, because that's the only stock I chose to invested in and wont speak for others stocks. Thanks for the education though. When bitcoin hit 60k, I took all my money out and started my repair business. I dont plan to buy bitcoin until I see economy start to heal or hits below 5k since I still believe in bitcoin system. I dont invest in other stocks, only real estate and my own repair business."
12-3-3,Controlled demolition. Not gonna lie Ive been impressed with their execution thus far. But we havent seen major rolling liquidation yet. Thats when the real fun starts

13-1-1-1-1-1-1,Now he just has to hope BTC is still worth something in 10 years 
13-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,Suggest selling before jail.
13-1-1-1-1-1-2,Thinking in terms of money and prioritizing it over time is the stupidest thing I continue to read on a daily basis.
13-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Seriously, especially when that time is spent in jail. It's like these people have no concept of how long *10 years* is to spend in a prison cell. You could get stabbed in prison. It's not something anyone should want to commit to to walk away with some millions."
13-1-1-1-1-1-2-3,"We already sell our time every day working in a slave-wage economy. Even working 2080 hours a year (40 per week) at 20 per hour, pretending taxes don't exist is 41,600 in a year. To get 10 million, that's 240 years of work...again assuming no taxes. But since we're talking 10 years, it's 416,000 dollars.Going to jail is the equivalent of ""working"" a 24/7 job, or 8760  hours in a year. Or 87,600 hours in 10 years. Which works out to 114/hour. Or nearly 6x what our hypothetical 20/hour person is makingWages have stagnated to the point that most people would **absolutely** sell 10 years of their life to have financial independence and security for the remainder. And you get to avoid that whole corporate rat race as an added bonus."
13-1-1-1-1-1-2-4,yet that is what most of the world does every day...you cant eat time
13-1-1-1-1-1-4,Is bitcoin going to still have any value in 10 years?
13-1-1-1-1-2,"I mean, it sounds like he was a script kiddie and had no clue what he was really doing and they tracked him down by IP address.They probably know *exactly* how much he stole from the exchange.It said he exploited a shopping cart bug."
13-1-1-1-1-2-1,"It sounds like he had the fortune split up into multiple wallets already. At some point, even if they knew the exact amount, there is plausible deniability related to him not having every penny of it still, or even having lost some of it to a dead hard drive or lost password.They would have to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the knows exactly where the remaining BTC is and that he has the ability to unlock it."
13-1-1-1-1-3,"Except it's Bitcoin, there's a ledger for where it moved."
13-1-1-1-1-3-1,"It wouldn't matter where it goes if your anonymous wallet is in the middle of two transactions. Might be able to discern what was purchased, but not who owns the wallet in between."
13-1-1-1-2,"The simple answer is that you would have had to have been crazy to invest in Bitcoin before it took off.That's it. That's the reason.He was crazy, he got lucky, but he still was crazy.Simple as that."
13-1-1-1-2-1,"FBI googled bitcoin on the blockchain, and discovered it is an open decentralized public ledger. well that was simply crazily easy."
13-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Yeah, bitcoin's one of the least anonymous possible methods of buying things, short of just using a debit card lmao"
13-1-1-1-2-1-1-1,"I mean, not really. Yeah, if you fund your wallet with money straight from your own bank then obviously it's not anonymous. If your wallet starts as anonymous though, and it's only used for digital transactions, it's a lot harder to trace who owns it."
13-1-1-1-2-1-1-5,That's not really true. All the ledger records is transfers between bitcoin addresses. Linking a person to those addresses can be very hard indeed. Particularly in the wild west Silk Road days when there were lots of exchanges that required no ID to purchase bitcoin and there were lots of bitcoin tumblers.
13-1-1-1-2-3,"the only reason the silkroad ever worked was because there was cryptocurrencies.If you used credit cards and shit for transactions, it wouldve been caught deadly fast. and everyone who took part in the transactions there wouldve been caught too.If you say, oh they couldve used a different type of currency, what kind?"
13-1-1-1-2-3-1,Dude. He stole from drug dealers. That's crazy.He buried his stolen money in the ground. That's crazy.He stayed inside the United States after commiting several felonies when he had the time and means to leave. That's crazy.He stole a crazy money from criminals and then stayed in town. That's crazy.You are focusing on the wrong part.
13-1-1-1-2-4,I remember years ago seeing it for sale for $0.06.  Might have been silk road.  I don't recall.  Was back when I first learned of TOR and played around with it a bit.
13-1-1-1-3,Right!? All that to get fukn popped in Georgia.
13-1-1-1-5,The problem in this case is that because of how blockchains work once it is know that a specific wallet is linked with criminal activity. Any subsequent transaction with it can be flaged and a forensic accountant just needs to whatch for any transactions there are illicite services to try launder crypto currency by pooling an redistributeing it. But it still imposes risks.
13-1-1-2,"ITs hard to sell or even move 3 billion. They knew the wallets, laundry services will do small amounts but large arent going to work.he should have fucked off for sure, but it would be harder for him to live off this stuff than you think. They knew the wallets involved. going on most exchanges would have gotten him busted. His options were mostly illegal and if you arent already a cartel, you are going to find it hard to move that much money and launder it.(hey he could just move it to another wallet, plausible deniability, not so much when its 3 billion dollars)"
13-1-1-2-1,"In my mind, move internationally, you're already aware of the dark web so start some random dark web businesses and slowly ""wash"" the money for the rest of your life"
13-1-1-2-1-1,Or just buy monero
13-1-1-2-1-1-1,Arstechnica article on this specifically mentions that the IRS was able to seize monero he had converted as well
13-1-1-2-2,"It wasn’t this sophisticated back when he stole it. Up until the Silk Road crackdown, a lot of people assumed that shit was untraceable. When he took it, it also wasn’t worth nearly this much. Getting out of the country would probably have gone through half of it on the spot. I probably would have tried to get out of it a couple years back when it was super inflated and there were exchange’s everywhere. Book a flight out and start trickling the money out through half a dozen sources and start swapping until you can reasonably get some of it into cash to live forever on an island somewhere. Will never get to the billion range but you can probably grind out millions where it’s hard enough to trace back to you."
13-1-2,"He still hears the ~~heartbeats~~ mouseclicks of his victims, so he tried to bury it in the floorboards to silence it, how tragic"
13-1-2-1,r/unexpectedPoe
13-1-2-1-1,"“Somehow, bitcoin returned.”"
13-1-2-1-1-1,The telltale flash drive
13-1-3,"What a fucking rookie move. Obviously they are gonna find the popcorn tin in a safe under the floor suspicious, given the safe and the floorboards. Put the same tin in your cabinet next to the popcorn, and they would have never looked twice ... Hiding in plain sight ... AMATEUR!"
13-1-3-1,Click on the link and you’ll get more context:“Officers say they found the Bitcoin dotted around his home on hard drives and other storage devices in an underfloor safe and on a tiny computer hidden inside a popcorn tin in a bathroom closet.”
13-1-3-1-1,"but why.. in the bathroom? wtf is wrong with that guy... ""nobody's gonna suspect anything if I put this popcorn can next to my toothbrush"""
13-1-3-1-1-1,I imagine the raspberry Pi sitting in the popcorn tin was a pretty big red flag.
13-1-3-1-1-2,"Those decorative metal popcorn tins are great storage bins. He could’ve been using it to store towels, or as a trash can even, and had it hidden in there."
13-1-3-3,I know this is a joke but when federal search warrants are executed they basically destroy everything. I have a feeling all the containers in the house either were or would have been dumped out.
13-1-3-3-1,They also use dogs to sniff out electronic devices.
13-1-3-3-1-1,Then hide the money in a microSD card and hide the card in an old school VCR. That's what I do.
13-2,"There’s so much unclaimed bitcoin out there. I’m amazed that they managed to recover this, but it’s a huge find."
13-2-1,"In 2017, there was a little under 4 million (out of 21 million theoretically possible) that were forever lost."
13-2-1-1,"It'll *eventually* be entirely lost -- at least, enough of it will be lost that people will stop giving a crap about it.  People will lose their wallets or take the passwords to their grave.  Then it'll just remain as nothing more than a value stand-in for black market sheisters, like no-name non-historical artwork."
13-2-1-1-1,"Well, MY giant stone is actually underwater, but we all know it's there, so it still has value.  I own it, after all."
13-2-1-1-1-1,That's how it works in Yap
13-2-1-1-2,"Two thoughts come to mind. 1. It'll be impossible for all Bitcoin to be destoryed prior to 2140 (before our lifetimes) because new Bitcoin will be introduced in the mining process.2. As the supply shinks, people will just use smaller denominations of Bitcoin, and use different units, to reference such amounts. For example, 1 Bitcoin, would just be divided into 100,000,000 parts. Just like how you have cents, or millimetres, or nanoseconds etc."
13-2-1-1-3,"yeah, in like 155 years"
13-2-1-1-4,I question whether or not this is even a crime. Who were the victims and how bad were their losses? I don't understand why the Federal government is trying to recover what is essentially stolen electronic monopoly money. Is the government going after casinos to help gamblers who blew their retirement savings in Vegas?
13-2-2,"something something blockchain is an open ledger? Boss , I found out what's wrong with the lawnmower, I fixed it!what was it?it was outta gas."
13-2-3,It sucks they recovered it. The feds made false charges to take down Silk Road the last time when dread pirate roberts was arrested
13-3,"Government going to ""hold onto"" the bitcoin?"
13-3-2,The FBI already seized everyone's balance on Silk Road. It's not like they're gonna restore this to the people who were stolen from---their identities are probably encrypted anyway. This was just a straight payday for them.
13-3-2-1,"Got themselves a nice, new black budget since the overwhelming majority of Congress doesn't know how *any* of that shit works."
13-3-2-1-1,"At the time of it's theftthe bitcoin was worth 100 million, so we will return 100 million to the treasury to be dispersed to anyone with a legitimate claim.Ok, and what about the remaining 3.26 billion?As we said... we're returning the 100 million to the treasury."
13-3-2-1-2,"> new black budgetYes, that 50k bitcoin is worth a whole 500 trillion.. err 23 cents, no wait 300 billion, wait no..."
13-3-2-1-2-1,If you time it right you can arm an entire insurgency.
13-3-2-1-2-1-1,Or buy a whole bag of taffy!
13-3-2-1-2-3,That was funny in 2015.
13-3-2-1-2-3-1,Fucking lol you also post in star citizen. Name me a better combo than crypto cultists and people dropping infinite money on a game that will never come out.I'm betting I can find you fluffing Elon in your post history too.
13-3-2-1-2-3-1-2,"I don't really give a fuck about crypto, and your take on SC is pretty outdated too."
13-3-2-1-2-3-1-3,"I don't understand where all of that came from? That joke was raging in 2016, it's not that offensive to point out that it's outdated. If it was at least factual, maybe it would still be slightly funny, but why do you get so hostile over a simple comment?"
13-3-2-1-2-3-2,"Still is, too!"
13-3-2-1-2-3-4,"It's funny now, too."
13-3-2-1-3,"> Got themselves a nice, new black budget since the overwhelming majority of Congress doesn't know how any of that shit works.You know the FBI is Executive branch, right?"
13-3-2-1-3-1,"Yes, thank you for asking."
13-3-2-1-3-1-1,No problem. You can go back and edit your original post whenever you like so that it isn't blatantly ignorant.
13-3-2-2,"Yes but like, do they liquidate it? Do they hold it as Bitcoin? What happens now?"
13-3-2-2-2,"i don't know what they do in this specific case, but here in germany the government is selling the bitcoin public after the case is closed / done. or atleast did so in previous cases where they got bitcoins from such marketplaces."
13-3-2-2-3,"Obviously, they transfer it to an exchange, sell it all at once and crash the price of bitcoin."
13-3-2-2-4,"In the past, the American government (fbi i think it was) sold confiscated bitcoin in giant blocks of coins by auction."
13-3-2-2-5,But you can track where any individual coin is right? So if the feds were to do anything with it someone in a tinfoil hat would be able to tell. Right?
13-3-2-3,They auction them off for cheap.
13-3-2-3-1,"Cheap, eh?  I bid $5."
13-3-2-3-1-1,Lol. Yeah they liquidate them. When I first bought btc my first coin cost $5.8 per coin. Wish I didn't spend them on stupid shit.
13-3-3,"the official government term is ""hodl"""
13-3-4,Most likely have some block trade with one or more larger institutional investors domiciled in the US. Throwing all of them on an exchange could nuke the system
13-3-5,They’re busy DECENTRALIZING it.
13-4,"damn some real dummies in the criminal community, how was this not turned into lambos and clubs and hookers and blow by now???/s sort of"
13-4-1,They didn’t look up money laundering in the dictionary I guess. It’s A LOT of money to launder and any assets like cars or clubs will have a paper trail to be seized. This is a good write up on another couple billion in Bitcoin.
13-4-1-1,"Great write up, I was half commenting tongue in cheek but I had assumed there were ways to launder bitcoin by swapping out to other currencies then back. I guess not if the amounts are large enought to attract attention.  Does the IRS care where you got your bitcoin as long as you pay taxes on the profit??"
13-4-1-1-1,There are drug dealers that will have accountants report their drug profits. It is often better to get in trouble for the charge than for the tax evasion. Government takes tax evasion seriously.
13-4-1-1-1-1,"There isn’t a line on the tax return for “drug dealing”.It is something like untaxed income, which covers a boatload of things."
13-4-1-1-1-1-1,There's a line for illl gotten gains
13-4-1-1-2,"There used to be Tornado Cash, which was a service that literally laundered crypto for people, but it got shut down (or at least made illegal to access for US citizen), for being a blatant crypto laundry service"
13-4-3,Hard to explain to the IRS tho
13-4-4,$3.36 \*billion\*. If he started with $3.37 billion that's still $10 million he he could have blown on lambos and hookers and blow. Most people would have difficulty spending that sort of money.
13-5,Good thing Bitcoin is so decentralizzed from government control.
13-5-1,"One would have to assume the guy wrote down or stored in a text file on a drive his private keys and wallet addresses and hid them across his house like an idiot, and that's what the authorities found.  Otherwise yes, there wouldn't have been anything for the authorities to seize."
13-5-1-1,"I dunno. The NSA has done some crazy shit, especially relating to en/decryption and reverse engineering. Wouldn't surprise me at all if they had *some* way to get peoples key, but didn't tell anyone. And it's likely that the guy was using a hardware wallet, which is what they found in the house. Sure, on paper it's *nearly* impossible to brute force 256 bit encryption, given it's got a sufficient algorithm. But thats mainly given the tech we are aware and familiar with. And I'd be willing to bet money that if *anyone* is using quantum computing (or other advanced tech) for anything related to encryption, the NSA is already *all* over it."
13-5-1-1-1,"> if they had some way to get peoples key, but didn't tell anyoneThat would be ""break any modern encryption, including access to your bank account"" tech. If they had it, someone would leak it eventually, then all bets would be off for *any* kind of secure data transfer on the modern internet."
13-5-1-1-1-1,"The NSA had the tech to decompile compiled code for reverse engineering purposes, for *years*. And it only became publicly known and available recently, and only because it was deprecated. Ghidra, if you're interested. There are absolutely secrets kept within that organization."
13-5-1-1-1-1-2,"Bro I was decompiling and deobfuscating code back in like 2004, you're kind of speaking out of your element here"
13-5-1-1-1-1-2-1,"It's hard for me to wrap my head around someone that's been doing this for so long, but starts their comment off with ""bro"". For some reason ""man"" and ""dude"" seem fine, but ""bro""... I dunno. I guess it just feels weird, is all I'm saying. You do you, to each their own obviously. But we've gotta, at the absolute least, both be in our 30s. I dunno."
13-5-2,How did they 'seize it from his home' if it's digital? It''s not like there was a giant pirate chest of gold coins with a funny looking B on it.
13-5-2-2,they found the private keys somehow.
13-5-2-2-1,"This is the answer.  Dude probably had digital images or copies of his private keys stored with the drives, or close by.  Once they get your private keys, it's game over.  They don't even need the physical media anymore."
13-5-2-2-1-1,Gotta split up the private keys and hide them randomly like geocaches. In places only you’d remember. Like horcruxes!
13-5-2-2-1-1-1,I heard some guy put his private key in a custom made crossword puzzle he printed out and put on his desk. I wonder how long it lasted until something got spilled on it or it was thrown out.
13-5-2-3,I believe he gave up the keys to reduce his sentence.  That's usually how it works.
13-5-2-3-1,Let’s see the papers
13-5-2-3-2,Why would he still be hiding the wallets then?
13-5-2-3-2-1,"Wallets?  Once you give up your keys, the wallet becomes irrelevant."
13-5-2-3-2-1-1,Don't you need to know what the keys open?  If what you were saying is true they didn't need to raid his home in the first place.
13-5-2-3-2-1-1-1,"The private keys are what's needed to access the bitcoin.  They can be entered into any wallet, hardware or software, in order to transact.  Wallets are typically protected by a PIN, but in any case it's the keys they were after.They take the form of a 12- or 24-word seed phrase, often written on paper and hidden away.  So that's probably what this guy had to give up."
13-5-2-4,Could of had the keys written down like a dummy
13-5-2-4-1,"It's the fbi they have real high end PCs. They have had over 10 years to do a brute force approach. Or it was written down in a document. Or Ross U, gave them the key for possibly getting his sentence reduced at some point. Who really knows. They probably paid a company several million to hack it too. There are billions of reasons why they would."
13-5-2-4-1-1,"Here's some napkin math: it'd take all 2 billion computers on the planet, doing 1 billion operations per second, about 5 trillion years to brute force an ECDSA key. Nothing short of an algorithmic flaw, mathematical/engineering breakthrough, or backdoor is enough to get through modern encryption in a reasonable amount of time today."
13-5-2-4-1-1-1,">1 billion operations per secondSo do you mean collectively or individually? Because we have single machines that are in the exaflop range. Or, 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.Which knocks the duration down. Also, most modern encryption has attack vectors that can be exploited. Of course, that assumes they give a shit about any of it."
13-5-2-4-1-1-1-1,"On the order of scale of modern encryption, collectively or individually wouldn't even matter all that much. Many modern encryption methodologies would take longer than the remainder of ""time"" as we know it to break a robust randomly chosen code set."
13-5-2-4-1-2,">high end PCs. Lol.  If bitcoin could be hacked with a high-end PC, it wouldn't even be a thing."
13-5-2-4-1-2-1,"When I mean hacked I mean the computer they might of stores the key on, or if they had a zip file that had a picture of the private keys. Something like that,.not brute forcing a 64  character key"
13-5-2-4-1-2-1-1,"Consider polishing your writing skills and not pretending to know the anything about crypto.  Private keys aren't safe in digital form, so they're normally written on paper and well hidden.  A hardware wallet protects them with a PIN and password, and the paper copy is there as a backup.  This guy was coerced into revealing them."
13-5-2-4-1-3,you can’t hack at in 10 years even with the best supercomputers
13-5-2-4-1-3-1,"It really depends on what encryption they used on the USBs where they held their keys, their devices could be surprisingly unsecure."
13-5-2-4-1-3-1-1,"No one puts their private keys on a “usb stick” lol. Especially with that much coin, it was likely multi-sig on steel plates geographically separated. They gave it up for a reduced sentence."
13-5-2-4-1-4,it's not physically possible to brute force private keys
13-5-2-4-1-4-1,Talking about hacking computers to get into zip files or icloud shit where you wrote down the private key or took a picture..
13-5-3,It is though. This guy stored it improperly.Edit: I’m baffled this comment has 600 upvotes. Peoples level of education in this space is non existent I see.
13-5-3-2,"They still seem to think it can be seized via the network.  I guess if you own bitcoin, you can be assured by this level of ignorance that adoption is still early."
13-5-3-2-1,"Exactly. They think a guy writing down the seed phrase and hiding it, or storing it on a computer and it getting stolen is the network being hacked. A person has the option to memorize and have no confiscatable object that get their funds stolen. A person can shoot you and take an object. A person can’t shoot you and take bitcoin because hey have that option."
13-5-3-2-1-1,"You don't even need to memorize 12 words, just a passphrase that you invent will do.  As long as it stays in your head, you're golden.  That's the level of certainty people aren't seeing yet."
13-5-3-3,Crypto bro?
13-5-3-3-1,Nope I hate crypto. I’m only a proponent of bitcoin.
13-5-3-3-1-1,"So, Yes."
13-5-3-3-1-1-1,Not really. Big difference between bitcoin and crypto.
13-5-5,"Why does a dumb, misspelled comment like this get upvotes?"
14,"""Why didn't I buy at $30k?"""
14-1,I only buy high and sell low
14-1-1,This guy fucks
14-1-2,This is not the way.
14-1-2-1,Wdym it is the way
14-1-2-1-1,You can still buy high right now and sell @ approx $14k
14-1-2-1-1-1,Why not sell @ $3.50 to maximize losses? 
14-1-2-1-1-1-1,Because it won’t go that low 
14-1-3,When they say BIG BRAIN they mean babypho
14-1-4,ONE OF US
14-1-5,This is the best strategy!
14-2,"Listen buddy, I’m doing you a favor.Because as soon as I buy at $30K it’s going down to $10"
14-2-1,Promise?
14-2-1-1,Promise
14-2-1-1-1,This is a sacrifice I am willing to have you take
14-2-1-1-1-2,If the amount of of money I put in bitcoin goes down to zero does that mean I lose my investment for good or can it reappear in the price of bitcoin rises again?
14-2-1-1-2,Can you buy like just one so I can afford a few after the dip?
14-2-2,Your account died for our sins!
14-2-2-1,"What are the things we did in the past that we are deserving these kind heart men,Hard to find any but finally i met someone who is willing to sacrifice himself."
14-2-3,"Limit order set at $10, do it!"
14-2-4,"Listen buddy, thanks for making this sub copetarded"
14-2-5,Take one for the team. Buy at 30k so it can drop to $10. Then I’ll make sure to buy you some more coins. 
14-4,Interest rates are rising. Markets crashing. Wars going on. Oil reaping. That's why people scared to buy anything. But that is exactly when you buy for super long term.
14-4-1,"""super long time"" might not have to be more than 3-4 years."
14-4-1-1,Or it might have to be 3-4 years just to *break even*That’s what happened with some stocks after 08 crash
14-4-2,Be greedy when others are fearful.
14-4-2-1,I almost sold my car last week when it was in the 26s. I still emptied my checking account and took a loan against some other bitcoin to buy as much as I could.I absolutely would have sold my car if it hit 20k.
14-4-2-1-1,You...took out a loan to buy Bitcoin?
14-4-2-1-1-1,Against bitcoin I already own. Same as doing stock on margin.
14-4-2-1-1-1-1,I don't understand either of those things unfortunately. Thank you for replying though
14-4-2-1-2,"Even if it goes up %200 percent egh maybe, There are better and faster ways to turn 20k into 60k. That’s only making $500 a week for 2 years. Not many people have 20,000 cash laying around. Be smart and collect residential income for years to come . Good luck"
14-4-2-1-2-1,/r/restofthefuckingowl
14-4-2-1-2-1-2,Haha dork
14-4-2-1-2-2,Some examples of better and faster ways? Asking seriously
14-4-2-1-2-2-1,"Ok yes. Like I said before. If you had 10k to 20k you can do multiple things to collect residual income or putting your money to work. I’ll give you 3 examples. 1. Start subleasing rentals units. I have 3 to 5 units every year collecting me rent. 2. Lease a property and turn that into (your own AirBNB Business). You will be able to Double the monthly rent each  Month. 3. Purchase or Finance a few Mobile homes or fix them up and rent them out.  Bitcoin is great, but unless it goes up it won’t make you money year after year. I personally do all of these plus other things.  I Don’t want to confuse you, but I also buy boat slips and boat dockage to run boat clubs and jet ski rentals. Once you get everything set up you then sell the Business to someone else ex. It’s all about delegating activities so you can make money. But again not many people have access to 10k to 25k . Please excuse my grammar I’m driving in car"
14-4-2-1-3,its better to sell a car instead of applying for loan
14-4-2-2,"yeah, BTC bear certs are printing right now"
14-4-3,"My fear isn't buying now for those reasons, it's because it could go down even more then I'm out of cash to take advantage."
14-5,"People don't want to buy at 30k, 10k or even 1k. In reality they simply don't want to buy at market prices, but at a significantly lower price. So if the price is 60k they want to buy at 30k, but if the price is 30k they want to buy at 20k or 10k. That's how it works. When they actually do buy, it's just FOMO."
14-5-1,My buy orders are set to 100k because that's what makes the market price. You guys need to do better.
14-5-2,"I just don't want to buy it because it's a 0 sum speculation market that totally fails as a viable currency mainly because its ""investors"" do not understand what it is - so much so that they literally reinvented the bank so that they could exchange a currency designed specifically to not rely on banks.It's also the most environmentally catastrophic currency in the history of humanity, and the value is inflated by a conglomerate that could easily launch a 51% attack at any time. Buying bitcoin is the equivalent of dedicating your will to a techbro hedge fund manager, handing him a gun, and daring him to shoot you.Ya'll dumb as hell."
14-5-2-2,"Easily launch a 51% attack eh lol you would need the largest pools out there to team up and unanimously agree to change the protocol to earn more coins without the rest of the Bitcoin world noticing. Or someone can just casually buy enough ASICS to account for 51% of the hash rate which is literally impossible and not worth the risk of the plan failing and wasting a ton of resources when they could simply just mine the Bitcoin legitimately with all that hash power in the first place in that hypothetical scenarioAlso of all things to complain about consuming energy people are so concerned with Bitcoin despite it being our current best option for hard money which we desperately need when we as humans consume so much energy with insignificant things like Christmas lights, game consoles, TV, leaving lights on, baseboard heating etc etc. priorities man"
14-5-2-2-1,"you mean the three pools at almost exactly 51%, where two of them are subsidiaries of the same group, and the third has a vested interest to do so?  And yeah, I think there are much better ways to use the world's energy reserves vs divesting morons of their fiat currencies."
14-5-2-2-1-1,The risk for the pools to do that is incredibly huge and not worth it by a LONG shot as it would get picked up by the community in a second. The world energy reserves?? That doesn’t even make sense we don’t store energy it gets produce as demand requires or in the case of renewables like wind and solar it’s produced dependant on environmental conditions. We don’t have a shortage of available energy we have an excess with no where productive to put it until now with BTC mining
14-5-2-2-1-1-1,"World energy reserves = fossil fuels underground. Pretend Earth is a giant nonrechargeable battery - because it is (with the notable exception of solar). Guess what kind of energy is used by the vast majority of miners.You also seem to have a basic misunderstanding of what a 51% attack is. It doesn't matter what the community picks up on. I also don't think it's productive to argue about the morality of those orgs - the point is that they could, and there is no regulation or body that could stop them."
14-5-2-2-1-1-1-1,"Actually BTC mining is far less than half fossil fuel according to the BTC mining counsel and continues to chase renewables as they’re generally cheaper not to mention the fracking sites where miners are used, even so the world doesn’t depend solely on fossil fuels theres nuclear, hydro, wind, solar etc. we will be fine don’t fully buy into the fossil fuel hysteriaThe community is everything with BTC if news breaks on a 51% attack it’s game over for BTC as a whole and nobody wins there"
14-5-2-3,
14-5-3,I just buy it and use it right away then it doesn't matter what price it is.Fuck investing I'm to poor to fuck around with that shit lol
15,"Joe Biden Leads ‘Critical’ Call For Game-Changing, Global Bitcoin And Crypto Rules After Shock FTX Collapse"
15-2,SBF just gave them the justification they have been waiting for. The regulations will be far reaching and beyond centralized crypto exchanges. SBF is such a douche I hope they put him in prison forever.
15-2-1,"He just presented it in a silver platter, the fucker is a bane of crypto."
15-2-1-1,He did them a massive favour.
15-2-1-1-1,And gave them a bunch of money while doing it
15-2-1-1-1-1,And now they’re putting him in a good light in return. I really should kiss some rich people asses.
15-2-1-1-1-2,They’ll name a stadium in the Bahamas after him now
15-2-1-1-1-3,Precisely
15-2-1-1-2,"Never let a crisis get to waste, governance 101"
15-2-1-1-2-1,If everyone unite and doesn’t comply. Government would have no power
15-2-1-1-2-2,"""Liberals"""
15-2-1-1-2-2-1,Fucking liberals trying to fix things instead of just ignoring it.
15-2-1-1-2-2-1-1,"Well, it looks like the liberals got their 10%, so no harm, no foul."
15-2-1-1-2-2-1-2,Go back to meltdown propaganda bot. No fixing happening here.
15-2-1-1-3,"Now they will ""regulate"" us to hell and back"
15-2-1-1-3-2,SBF only proved why it is neccesary. You guys are all on some copium here.
15-2-1-1-3-2-1,"SBF was running a centralized, traditional finance operation. The same thing banks do. It can't prove anything about crypto because it wasn't crypto.Regulation will make it easier for entities like FTX to gain power and control. It will make competition difficult or impossible, it will prop these bad actors up instead of letting them fail, and it will be abjectly bad for consumers. Regulations are designed to help the rich get richer and if you can't see it you're a bloody fool."
15-2-1-1-3-2-1-1,Yah right. How dare their be regulations like fire exits and they like. I should be able to lock my workers in a factory while they are making shirts
15-2-1-1-3-2-2,"Why is it necessary? Anyone with their own keys still has all their crypto. The crimes he committed are already crimes. Anyone saying ""yeah we totally need more regulation you guys"" is a wuss"
15-2-1-1-3-2-2-1,"Regulation in a functioning society is used to prevent crime and theft. To prevent people from losing their money due to factors outside of their control. Crypto is currently unregulated, allowing for the creation of many rugpull scams and ponzi schemes. Or do you really think that the future of economics will be the wild west of crypto that we have right now? How do you want to achieve mass adoption when the chance of your money evaporating is so damn high?"
15-2-1-1-3-3,Fantastic. I hope all the scams are the first to go.
15-2-1-1-3-4,Exactly honestly who cares what Sam did. He was just a Capitalist who let other idiot Capitalists give money to him. We can't have the government regulating him and us.
15-2-1-1-4,"All part of the plan, notice sbf isn't even in custody yet??"
15-2-1-1-4-1,Because its unregulated there is no laws. You want to lock people up because you fell for the bull. Amway is legal in 50 states
15-2-1-1-4-1-1,"Unregulated or not, I’m sure some laws were broken when they were using customer’s crypto funds as FTX/Alameda’s own piggy bank.While I’m no fan of MLM companies, comparing amway to the financial fuckery that that fat fuck SBf and his dbag friends committed aren’t even remotely related."
15-2-1-1-4-1-1-1,"Coinbase was approached to bail FTX out. Coinbase reviewed the books. CEO od Coinbase came out and that SBF broke many laws, is absolutely a criminal, should be in jail... and suggested that the media's handling of the situation (being soft on SBF) was inexcusable.So from someone who saw FTX books... you are correct. Laws were broken."
15-2-1-1-4-2,"What laws has he broken?This is what happens when you put money in unregulated things. It's like kick-start backing, you're just listening to somebodies promises in the hope you get what they promise.It's always been a gamble, for every person who made money, somebody lost that money."
15-2-1-1-5,"Agreed. I feel like it was all by design. Also, he bought his free get out of jail card w/ his millions in political donations. I doubt he’ll face any kind of criminal charges from the DOJ To many politicians have been bought including the SEC Chairman.. ugh "
15-2-1-1-5-1,This was definitely orchestrated or manufactured as some might say.
15-2-1-1-5-1-1,"He was figurehead in a sense, to a degree. There had to be teams of scammers setting this whole thing up to, as you say, orchestrated. Those scammers got rich and disappeared."
15-2-1-1-5-1-2,I think he was a CIA Patsy
15-2-1-1-5-2,When does any financial Wall Street type fuckery ever get criminally charged. 2008 was a perfect example of these assholes getting away with thievery.
15-2-1-2,I wouldn't be surprised if it was set up by banks and governments
15-2-1-2-1,"Let’s be fair, it was only a matter of time before greedy assholes fucked the crypto space and us over. There have been lots before, SBF just did it bigger and better!"
15-2-1-2-1-1,"Can you name a legit person in crypto?Because everyone is here to buy a new lambo. Everybody is greedy, people brought bitcoin at 60k thinking it was only going up. People didn't sell at 60k for the same reason. Greed.People today are still going all in on bitcoin because they think it'll go back up to where it was.Everyone here is greedy."
15-2-1-2-2,"Totally made up conspiracy…Some big bank orchestrated the Terra collapse, 3AC / Voyager / Celsius contagion. FTX was advised on how to best kick the can to centralize control of the industry. Then regulators step in and find ways to move control of the crypto global financial markets back into control of the banks. Now, I made all that up.  It’s very easy to connect dots when all the people involved are so tightly intertwined in their quest for money and power."
15-2-1-2-2-1,In all fairness didn’t  it cost someone around $2 billion to pull that off?
15-2-1-2-2-1-1,Yes. And it’s the exact type of thing one of the big banks would want to do. It also could have been a hedge fund trading with lots of leverage.
15-2-1-2-2-3,>tightly intertwined in their quest for money and power.So sociopaths will sociopath.
15-2-1-2-2-4,Or.. asshole scams market for what could have been personal gain.If you are in it for the tech you understand regulation is needed.  Desperately.
15-2-1-2-2-4-2,I am in for the tech and money because I think the tech is extremely valuable. The infrastructure is already there to build great things.I agree with you though. Regulation is needed for mainstream adoption of the technology.
15-2-1-2-3,With all the stuff coming out I’d say this explanation has gone from a “maybe” to a “likely”.
15-2-1-2-3-1,"Or its just an unregulated market woth tons of people throwing money at it because they see so many coins making huge returns and everyone screaming about missing out. This is pretty much how every market that has regulations got them. Someone got greedy and scammed a shit load of people out of their mo money and screwed up the markets.It doesn't have to be some conspiracy theory every time, normally it's just greed and stupidity."
15-2-1-2-3-1-1,"Don't you think it's weird that the biggest scammer in the space, whose internal books were evidence of incredible crimes, was the one cozying up to politicians and asking for regulations?Don't you think it's weird that same guy, on the revelation of his crimes, got handled with kid gloves by the same media that tears everyone else in the space to shreds?"
15-2-1-2-3-1-1-2,">Don't you think it's weird that the biggest scammer in the space, whose internal books were evidence of incredible crimes, was the one cozying up to politicians and asking for regulations?That's how the cronyocracy rolls.   He wanted to make sure the regs would not apply to him by buying politicians."
15-2-1-2-3-1-1-3,"So you think it’s some Illuminati group that controls all banks and media. Yeah… sounds legit. Also, SBF has been torn apart by the media. Do you read the news?"
15-2-1-2-3-1-2,Best post in a long time. This is big money without regulation folks.
15-2-1-2-3-1-3,"Agreed, but have you seen the trail of funds on this thing? Is it not strange that he’s chilling at home with hardly a care in the world? Not odd that most major media outlets have been silent on it? I hate leaning towards conspiracy but this if rife with all the right players."
15-2-1-2-3-1-3-1,"Ya he's not chilling at home without a care in the world. There's really no way he's not going to jail and he must know it by now.They haven't been silent. Go to the business or tech sections of major media groups and you will find front page articles about this. This is still relatively recent, there's not a ton of I formation besides confusing financial info it's no wonder wonder it's not on the news desk TV segments yet."
15-2-1-2-3-1-4,"You’re right, nothing to see here. The rich and powerful never conspire to keep themselves rich and powerful. Move along - I pray people like you are just bots, or I weep for the future of our species"
15-2-1-2-3-1-5,"Regulated markets do not result in a protected  market from the greedy asshats that break the rules, exploit it and destroy millions of lives in the processes.Regulated market is just an euphemism for fixing the game, making it a big boys club and only few can benefit from it.Regulation did not stop the 2000 crash, the 2008 crash, and won't stop the 2023 crash. It didn't stop Elon pumping and dumping stocks as much as shitcoin, and wanking off in the face of SEC who gave him some miniscule fines for market manipulation. It did not stop the market makers from killing the buy button a couple of years ago. Talk to me about regulated money when a single hedge fund manager or high level banker goes to prison for stealing from the poor. But this is bs, the world has never agreed to anything that matters, who is gonna listen to a Methuselah trying to tell them how to handle something he can't comprehend."
15-2-1-2-4,Same what i was thinking...
15-2-1-2-5,"I know right, he was a trad finance/democrat insider that was pals with the SEC that just came out of nowhere with the MSM giving him nonstop puff pieces and him pushing the regulation himself.  And then “whoops I stole all your monies” despite there really no reason for him to do it - I am pretty sure he could have like Alameda die and let FTX live and nothing bad would have happened.  FTX was likely hugely profitable on its own, seems like it was done on purpose."
15-2-1-3,I think we were crazy to every think the government writing every get involved.Sucks for sure but uncle Sam is always there to pounce on our freedoms
15-2-1-3-1,Government would not be involved if there is not a lot of money so that taken get it
15-2-1-4,"Tin hat time, we know he had connections with Bill Clinton, maybe some people gave him the idea and the motivation to do what he did wink wink. Probably not but it’s very suspicious"
15-2-1-5,"Yup, if we get rid of all the scammers crypto will be great."
15-2-1-5-1,Thats not gonna happen without regulation...and even then it wouldn't eliminate all of them.
15-2-1-5-1-1,You're telling me crypto doesn't change human nature? Blasphemy.
15-2-1-5-1-2,That is why the rules and regulation in any market is very much necessary
15-2-1-5-1-3,"Regulators are scammers themselves.  Just different thugs with bigger baseball bat.  All saint Gary, that this reddit preached as crypto friend in government, was literally picking winners with FTX.  It's good to be friend with regulator who does only hand subpoenas to your competitors and gives you a pass.  While others are scared shitless to even start making any crypto project inside US, SBF  got to #2 in like span of 2 years full yolo.  Regulators are not friends.  Also don't start with ""but if we get good regulators in place""  Not gonna happen, system is designed to not allow anyone like that get into any relevant power.  So maybe we should stop asking for regulation and try to regulate ourselves, even if it means we will have 95% of scammers running around.  This fiasco is already proving NYK-NYC and after this flush, sector is getting cleansed from all bad actors."
15-2-1-5-1-3-1,"Its really great you're equating regulators with regulations, thats such a disingenuous and bad faith argument.Regulations have done a lot of good in America. Just because things aren't perfect doesn't mean regulations are bad. So get off your conspiracy theory laden high horse.And the sector isn't getting cleansed of its bad actors from this fiasco, there's a million more laying in wait. Crypto has had a decade to regulate itself and its in worse shape than ever...you had your chance."
15-2-1-5-1-3-2,"Regulators are likely to promise government backed insurance, and then completely forget about something crucial, and so when something massive goes insolvent the government would have to pay. Then, it is just that same story over and over again."
15-2-1-5-2,This!!
15-2-2,Him and the other 65 people who did this exact same thing previously. It’s like it will keep happening or something.
15-2-2-1,It's almost as if capitalism doesn't work without regulation because consumers are not rational actors and won't just choose the company that won't screw them over.
15-2-3,And how will DeFi be regulated? It's literally impossible.
15-2-3-1,Shut off fiat on-ramps so that the average person can’t get new liquidity into the ecosystem. Simple as
15-2-3-1-1,What's the justification for something like this? The exchanges are the things that need to be stopped from abusing customer funds and using the collateral to make risky loans or trades
15-2-3-1-1-1,"The majority of people is incapable of using DeFi due its complexity. They dont need to do anything with DeFi. If CEXes dance to their tune, they will be more than happy."
15-2-3-1-1-2,Justification = greed & maintenance of the status quo where the overlords leech any and all value the working class creates
15-2-3-1-2,Miners could sell direct to consumers like the old days ? The exchange is just a middle man.
15-2-3-1-2-1,Mass adoption is impossible if that is the case.  Ease of use and navigable medium of exchange are extremely important for retail investors.
15-2-3-1-3,What does this mean? ELI5 please
15-2-3-1-3-1,Stop you from turning your money into crypto.
15-2-3-1-4,Yep and then target money laundering laws to suggest money into these jurisdictions/industries are either outright against the law or are naturally suggesting criminal intent.
15-2-3-2,"As you can see with the tornado cash and blacklisting of addresses, it's actually pretty straightforward. Defi doesn't exist in a vacuum; there are many other points at which you could regulate what comes and goes."
15-2-4,">I hope they put him in prison forever. If you don't want any regulation, for what?"
15-2-4-1,His hair cut
15-2-4-2,"If there are no regulations, how will they put him in prison forever?"
15-2-5,Do you think we don’t need regulations after all this lol?
15-2-5-1,I just don't trust people that don't know how email works to regulate crypto.
15-2-5-1-1,If you dont want it to be regulated then you cant cry when scams happen or rugs get pulled either. If you want the wild west of currency you gotta take the good and the bad
15-2-5-1-1-1,"I'd like to hope that most of us crying over the potential regulations are also the same ones who only have our money on exchanges for the small amount of time it takes to buy an asset, quickly withdrawing it to our wallets so that we *aren't* the ones who cry when a scam or rug happens."
15-2-5-1-1-1-1,"Thats fair, and Im sure the majority of people on this sub do exactly that, but theres billions of dollars getting scammed away constantly so something has to change. Either better education, or regulate the shit out of exchanges so people actually want to keep their crypto in a cold wallet"
15-2-5-1-1-1-2,"100%  Learn people, Buy on CEX and get it out of there ASAP and into your personal wallets. CEX should only be used for Buying->Moving, not for Storing/Using it like a bank"
15-2-5-1-1-2,Your terms are acceptable
15-2-5-2,"The government barely regulates centralized exchanges. They regulate retail to ""protect"" retail, by limiting the ability of the retail trader. Not the exchange."
15-2-5-3,"So you want banks controlling crypto? Because that's a terrible idea, at least in Canada. Our bank fees are already ridiculous."
15-2-5-4,No I don't want regulations why do you think I went through all the trouble to not buy stocks?But notice they never ask crypto traders what our wants or needs are they just go ahead and decide that.**What I want is some wild west cowboy shit and yes I accept the risks that come with that.** Bankers are just mad people aren't parking their savings there anymore and the world governments just see an opportunity to tax the shit out of us they don't care about the safety of your investment get real.Regulations yeah totally because bankers and hedge funds totally don't just do whatever they want with zero consequences.  Instead of sending bankers to prison in the 08 crash we literally just gave the bankers more money instead. Talk about justice.
15-2-5-5,"Of course we do, unfortunately the loudest  people in crypto are the libertarian muh freedumb types that don’t understand that without regulation SBF and the ICO phase will happen again and again and again and crypto will lose every time.  For crypto to grow, regulation is a must"
15-2-5-5-1,"People are just skeptical that regulation is going to be what's needed, as opposed to a hammer to just shut the whole thing down. Every CEX and stablecoin should be tightly regulated, safety is so much more important than anything else in those spaces. Programs like gemini earn, heavily promoted by a CEX even though ""technically separate"" and extremely risky should also be banned IMO - if you want to get yourself in trouble with a ponzi you should at least have to go looking for it yourself."
15-2-5-5-2,"If crypto is just banks with extra steps, what's the point."
15-3,"AFAIK this is quite a nothing-burger of a story. It's bullets 31 and 35 from the g20 report at  They specifically refer to stable coins in 35, and in general want to be able to share asset information for pursuing tax avoiders. There's probably more to it but I was expecting something more tangible rather than ambiguous ""we think we'll do something""."
15-3-2,Yeah this article has a whole lot of nothing in it . Forbes isn’t a credible source . This article is written by a contributor not a journalist on Forbes payroll . Anyone can be a “Forbes contributor “
15-3-3,But can’t I just come in here and be outraged without having any facts?!
15-3-4,"This is reddit, you think your facts will stop a great headline and a bunch of bots?"
15-3-5,"Yep, all those articles try to make it look like Biden had this on top of his agenda. He probably doesn't care or know what exactly this is about."
15-4,It’s not crypto that’s at fault it’s the Exchanges that need regulation
15-4-1,The article even specifically said that Bitcoin‘s 70% “crash” caused FTX to collapse No. FTX caused FTX to collapse.
15-4-1-1,Either these writers are stupid or paid. There’s no other reason for them to put it like that.
15-4-1-1-1,Both
15-4-1-1-2,"Just want to slap them for real man, we want to do that."
15-4-1-2,The trouble is SBF was involved with the government and SEC so they need a scapegoat blame Bitcoin. Not only does exchanges need regulation but the government and the SEC
15-4-1-5,Ponzis continue until you run out of new buyers so the price crash caused the collapse
15-4-1-5-1,"A fair point. But I’d call that price crash the catalyst, not the problem"
15-4-1-5-1-1,True enough
15-4-2,"One thing is sure, people need to understand that treating CEXs like banks is bad and giving them too much power, power crypto tried to take back"
15-4-2-1,Exchanges are for trading and selling crypto. Your wealth stays in your wallet
15-4-2-1-1,Yes but most people still keep their crypto in exchanges and treat crypto like stocks
15-4-2-1-1-1,That’s their personal choice. Myself I trade buy and sell on a Exchange and the rest stays in my wallet
15-4-2-1-2,Which is why crypto will never succeed as actual currency lol
15-4-2-1-3,"Which is why crypto either needs to end or be regulated.It's worthless without safe places to exchange it and no where is really safe, they all have had issues.The buy/bust cycle will also continue in much bigger waves than the stock market as well because actual wealth is in it now.Anyone that actually got wealthy on crypto needs to transition to a safer investment. Crypto is basically gambling at this point except it's not even safe to cash out if you win."
15-4-2-1-3-1,DeFi is safe to exchange at. What are you talking about?Its Fiat to Crypto that is sketchy please don't confuse the two. CeFi is evil probably needs regulation. DeFi is a series of smart contracts. The smart contract IS the regulation.
15-4-2-1-4,Exactly. Well put.
15-4-2-2,And people need to understand they shouldn’t use a CEX that refuses to conduct a proof of reserve including liability auditing.
15-4-2-2-1,"Or, hear me out, pass regulations that require CEXs to have those in place"
15-4-2-2-1-1,"Or, here me out, let adults choose which exchange they want to use. We already have laws that protect against fraud. FTX broke the law by violating their terms of service and trading customer funds. Regulatory regimes are immortal and always grow larger. Existing industry giants push them to create larger and larger barriers of entry into the market, and we end up with oligopoly. That’s why we have like 6 tech giants that run the majority of the internet. I don’t want that for the crypto industry."
15-4-2-2-1-1-1,"You can choose your exchange. But the exchanges should still be regulated. Just like you can choose your bank, but they still have regulations. Regulations designed to either prevent or catch this type of fraud before it gets to the point where billions are gone in the blink of an eye. Unless you just want crypto to have its own '08 crisis ever year or so all in the name of not regulating exchanges."
15-4-2-2-1-1-1-1,"Crypto exchanges are not banks. Nobody should be storing their wealth there, so they don’t need the same regulations. What’s your answer to my concerns of oligopoly created by regulatory regimes?"
15-4-2-3,CEXs should be regulated and private wallets not
15-4-3,What does the article say? Very click-baity title that has me really curious but the article is locked behind a pay-wall lol
15-4-4,"Whether we like it or not, there are some regulations needed for crypto. There have been lots of outright scams, rugpulls, dev teams lying about supply etc. to warrant some regulation about coins and tokens themselves."
15-4-5,Or just use 1inch or uniswap
15-4-5-1,Off cause but we are talking about regulations. And I believe crypto is the innocent party.
15-4-5-2,1inch is banned in the US for some reason
15-5,"Regulation of crypto exchanges to protect users is eminently reasonable. But we also need protection from overreaching regulations that want to ""protect"" users from crypto..."
15-5-1,"They should just regulate CEXs and stable coins where actual financial promises are made to consumers.1) we will protect your funds2) the money we say we have we do actually haveI honestly wouldn’t care if we had a full blown digital dollar that acted as a stable coin. So long as, and this is the big caveat, those regulations don’t bleed into actual decentralized products. We shouldn’t be regulating the tech. We should be regulating people who claim to have guarantees. If I can eventually onboard from my digital dollar bank straight to a blockchain and back off I’m good. I don’t mind capital gains taxes moving to and from crypto/fiat so long as it’s reasonable.Fact is we need reasonable governance because Wild West chaos isn’t cutting it for global adoption"
15-5-1-1,> We shouldn’t be regulating the tech. We should be regulating people who claim to have guarantees. This. This one right here.This is the whole point of decentralized technology.
15-5-1-1-1,Unfortunately I highly doubt that is going to happen seeing as how the tornado cash dev is in jail while major scammers are running free.
15-5-1-1-2,"I mean it makes sense. CEXs are private companies eith a goal of making money. They should all be regulated, but are private wallets left alone"
15-5-1-1-2-1,"CEXs can be public companies too, e.g. Coinbase."
15-5-1-1-3,"We shouldn’t be regulating the “decentralized” tech.I know that’s what we are all basically saying, but just calling it out specifically."
15-5-1-2,"Well said.Regulate people’s greed, not technology. That only leads to hurting innovation."
15-5-1-2-1,Yeah but regulating people's greed and addictions won't work out that great I'm affraid
15-5-1-2-1-1,"Lol yeah. I know we can’t *actually* do that, but we can have laws set in place to prevent things like FTX from happening. Or at least protect consumers somewhat."
15-5-1-2-2,That worked so well in the traditional monetary system..../s
15-5-1-2-2-1,"I mean, it really did.  Since the great depression we haven't seen banks collapsing and losing everyone's money.  It used to be a relatively common occurrence like it is in crypto now.  Same goes with regulations on publicly traded companies.  Now and again there are major securities fraud cases, but nothing like we saw 100 years ago in the US or in less developed markets now.   Crypto shouldn't be immune from laws and regulations when it comes to fraud and gross mismanagement.  There's nothing wrong with risky assets that everyone knows are risky, but there is something wrong when people and companies are selling something as safe when it's actually not."
15-5-1-2-2-1-1,I guess you were young in 00 and 08 lol
15-5-1-2-2-2,"This is the challenge. History has shown that regulation will ultimately be used to control what should not be controlled, and abuse what is found to be profitable. Regulation is not inherently altruistic, it depends on regulators that are human, generally underpaid/undervalued, and responsible for writing rules that slow other humans from making obscene amounts of money at the expense of others. For example, it's an open secret among established industries that steep regulations are hugely beneficial as weapons to discourage competition by encouraging regulatory requirements that are easier for the incumbent to maintain than for new competition to establish. Regulate CEXs and stable coins? Sounds neat on paper, but allowing the financial regulators that oversee our banking systems anywhere near crypto is a double-edged sword."
15-5-1-3,"Agreed. We have regulations in traditional finance and it protects consumers somewhat. Nevertheless, we *still* see rampant fraud. The effects are simply mitigated due to government bailouts and central bank trickery. This gives the illusion that TradFi is a more honest game.Crypto goes through periodic cleansing and lots of innocents get hurt. Silver lining is that we don't kick can down the road. Cuaterize the wound and move on."
15-5-1-4,What a long winded way to say crypyo needs actual banking and exchanges similar to you know all currency and assets.Crypto is and was never going to work because that's the end game and it's no different than just using currency. There's even different currencies with different values.The effort put towards regulating crypto should just be towards actually regulating what we already have. Crypto already has capital gains taxes it's just infested with fake exchanges that don't bother doing the work like a stock exchange does.Hell the only benefits of crypto you want to give away but this shit has a purpose? It has none other than what's already taken care of with regular currency.
15-5-1-5,The fuck is this? A reasonable take? On r/cryptocurrency ?
15-5-2,All these games between the CEX-entities are really terrifying…for us as retailers but even more in terms of sane risk management.
15-5-2-1,"Risk management?!! Sir, this is r/CC"
15-5-2-1-1,"Others merely adopted the risk, we were born in it, molded by it"
15-5-2-2,"Agreed. Especially when they start to hold margin accounts and huge 'collateralized' loans with each other. They can lend/margin that money around in a circle and turn 1m in any actual money into a billion. It's insane.Just like what the investment banks did in '08, which is ultimately what got us to crypto. It's all a step in the wrong direction, the opposite of what crypto was meant to do/prevent.It's especially crazy because the collateral is toxic."
15-5-2-3,I really would be happy if they regulate CEX and influencers 
15-5-2-3-1,It would be interesting to see where the line starts to cross from free speech to defrauding consumers
15-5-4,It’s easy. Regulate CEX and things the average user engages with. Don’t regular dexes and defi. I’ll take on that risk myself
15-5-5,I fear they will just use it as an excuse to limit our rights but won't do anything about corruption in big finance. Why would they bite the hand that feeds them?
15-5-5-1,"This right here. They don't give a single fuck about you and I. SBF was a huge Democrat donor. Now all of a sudden it's ""we need regulate!""No they just want control and power."
15-5-5-2,Agreed. Regulators protect the interests of the governments and not the average joe
16,"Bitcoin drops below $35,000 over the weekend, extending Friday’s losses"
16-1,Bitcoin down but my Pokémon cards and GameCube games are up up up
16-1-2,"Collectibles have shown to be a much better investment than any real investment ive come across, lol."
16-1-2-1,"Yeah, wanna buy some beanie babies? ...please."
16-1-2-1-1,"Fuck outta here with your beanie babies, I'm tryin to sell my Pogs here!!!"
16-1-2-1-1-1,Remember Alf? He’s back…in Pog form.
16-1-2-1-1-1-1,You sold my soul for some pogs?!
16-1-2-1-1-1-1-1,“In the Garden of Eden” by I. Ron Butterfly
16-1-2-1-2,"Problem with these is they were marketed as collectibles from the start. People bought them to collect and preserved them, so none of them are rare.Pokemon cards for example were purchased by/for kids, who abused them and were rough with them and traded them. As they got older they lost them or parents gave them away too. That makes the original sets super hard to come by in great condition. You see that with old comic books too.Odds are if something is made as a collectible or marketed at collectors, it’s not something collectors will want years from now with some very limited exceptions."
16-1-2-2,"I had a legitimately impressive Pokemon collection when I was 12 (1st edition Charizard/Blastoise/Venosaur holographic, Mew, etc) and my mom one day told me she gave them to her friend to give to her kid because I didn't ""play with them anymore""I randomly send her links to sales of those cards with a ""yeah I had this one too"""
16-1-2-2-1,"For what it's worth, if it helps your soul a little bit. You likely would have only gotten a fraction of the value that some of these cards are going for.Like some of the crazy 1st Ed. Charizards you see going for crazy money, those are Perfect Mint condition cards. I looked into getting some of my 1st edition foils potentially graded and after some searching, learned that its highly unlikely to be worth it. A lot of foils that came out of the wrapper back then weren't even Perfect 10/Mint condition, simply because the printing was never always perfect -- only sometimes."
16-1-2-2-1-1,You happen to see the cost of the grade lmao? Shit is a racket.
16-1-2-2-1-1-1,That one methhead on Pawn Stars is running a lovely Pokemon card grading scam right now. Listing a bunch of graded cards at 5-20x value because they have his custom sig on it.Fuckin ridiculous how everything falls into giant scam territory eventually.
16-1-2-2-1-1-2,"Based on coin grading, which is a racket… but necessary when you want rich people who aren’t coin experts to buy your expensive coins."
16-1-2-2-1-2,"Fyi a large portion of the stratosphere auctions aren't selling because they are mint like you think. They're being wash traded. If you want I can sell you one at 2/3rd price of the highest auction. Anytime the offer is actually put out no one seems to want is suddenly, how odd."
16-1-2-2-1-3,Thats the thing. It's about the CONDITION AND GRADE of the pokemon card. I sold my entire collection for about 1500 and had 2 charizards (non first edition) and they were each around 250.Grading takes a while right now still due to covid increasing the interest but unless you got some special fucking mega ultra rare pokemon card that's like 9.5 graded don't think you are winning the lottery
16-1-2-2-1-4,Yeah I got a card centering tool a while back to check on my cards that might be valuable. You don't realize how uncentered a card is until you actually see the lines to compare it to. There's some sets of baseball cards where the PSA 9.5/10 cards are worth a lot just because of how shit the printer was and almost none of them exist.Card grading typically isn't that bad. Part of why it's really bad right now because with COVID it seemed like everyone dug out their old card collections and started going through them. They are only offering the high tier services right now. Eventually the supply with catch up with the demand so just wait it out and get it graded in a year or two is what I say.
16-1-2-2-1-5,"I think there’s like one PSA 10 charizard in the world.A lot goes into it beyond the grading when it comes to collecting, some “first editions” are the first editions of later base sets and not the true first edition of that Pokemon on a card, for example."
16-1-2-3,"The collectible market is largely a façade though of certain people trading each other things at inflated prices. You're not likely to be able to sell your own at those prices, especially 20 years from now when the hype dies down."
16-1-2-3-1,Karl Jobst did a video on the current scam being done on the retro video game market by some of the same people who ran the scam on the baseball card and comic book markets.It's a grading service that has no real standards and can be bribed to give better grades.  They buy and sell things to themselves at 100x inflated prices and then get news services to do stories about it so they cab pretend they are worth a lot and then completely control the inflated market.
16-1-2-4,"Legit. Seriously. If you buy 1 of every lego set starting this year. You can start selling them off after 3-5 years for at least a 250/300% return. Start wars even more. I’ve been doing it for 10 years as supplemental income and I easily rake in about $5-10k a year extra for minimal effort selling on kijiji. Now, if you take this a step further, notice trends. Last 5 years has been the “architecture” series and “ideas” series. I spent nearly $4k on buying them. I’ll sit on these for 8-10 years. When I know most have been sold or lost to the ether, I’ll start selling them. But it’s a long game thing, but it’s fun and my way of “playing” the stock markets:)  I refuse to do this with the special editions, as I know few are made and want others to get those ones instead."
16-1-2-4-1,This is strangely brilliant and wholesome for a nefarious Lego scam 
16-1-2-4-1-1,It’s not a scam. I’m just holding on to lego for people that don’t know they want it yet. Nostalgia is a powerful drug!!
16-1-2-4-2,This is the best thing I have stumbled across in my morning wake-up Reddit browsing in ages. I feel wholly fulfilled by Reddit and am now ready to start my shower process for the day a full 45 minutes early.
16-1-2-5,I've got an old beanie baby collection that is my nest egg.
16-1-3,Pokemon and GameCube have intrinsic value.  Crypto

16-2-2-1,I’m waiting for that first idiot to make crypto options....irs gonna be a massacre 
16-2-2-1-1,The whole story of bitcoin is an object lesson in why finance got regulated in the first place.It's the south china sea all over.
16-2-2-1-1-1,those idiots can't even decide if it's currency or securities. ha.
16-2-2-1-1-1-1,"That’s because it is neither! It is worthless math crap, that is harming the actual world…"
16-2-2-1-1-1-1-2,I got into crypto as a serious investor in the beginning (BTC) and after some moderately-good returns I cashed out and switched to small-time investments into ETH. Much easier on the environment and I get to pretend I'm a mathxpert.
16-2-2-1-1-2,Did you mean the South Sea bubble? That was for South America not China. Well really it was for the UK who created a trade monopoly but forgot to ask the south americans.

16-2-2-1-4,"It exists, and it's exactly as volatile and moronic as you might imagine."
16-2-2-1-4-1,Figured as much
16-2-4,People were making this joke when it was $400
16-2-4-1,I panic spent rather a lot of BTC when it hit $10 because it was clearly stupid and would never hit that high again.I think about that a lot at 3AM staring at the used Xbox 360 I bought with some of it.
16-2-4-2,It might be valuable but currency needs to be stable and liquid.Bitcoin is neither of those things.Someone could design a crypto system that isn’t slow and doesn’t fluctuate wildly. We don’t have that now though.
16-2-4-3,> (..) when it was $400Cryptodudes saying this without a hint of selfawarewolves makes this just hilarious.Oh yea.. cryptocurrency is so stable.. perfect for a currency.
16-2-5,It's gone but not as fast as the 1000 you put in:NetflixPayPalSpotify BabaetcBitcoin is safer than stocks. We are very disappointed in you. Boring!!
16-2-5-2,"S&P down 15% YTD, Bitcoin down 25% YTD.It's a more volatile and risky investment than stocks, so it's not surprising it's gone down more. Went up more previously. There's a chance it might go through the roof in 10 years. There's a risk it'll be worth literally nothing in 10 years.It's definitely not 'safer' than stocks."
16-3,I guess I'd better dump all of my actual human-style money into Bitcoin while prices are low. And then buy a bunch of NFTs with that Bitcoin.Then I can just coast through life on the absolute intrinsic value of my folder full of jpegs.Ahhhhh....
16-3-1,No you invest in Dogecoin.Cryptos come and go but Dogecoin is a meme and memes last forever.

16-3-2,"Just like the only people who benefited from the Gold Rush were the hotel owners and tool sellers, the only people who are really benefiting from this Crypto bs are the platforms selling them.I had to recently pay a Russian contractor who's doing some work for me via ETH since no other forms of payment are viable atm. For the $2,000 or so ETH I paid him, I had to pay $100 in platform fees. It cost $ to buy the ETH, and then it cost $ to send the damn thing. Like how the fuck is this a viable currency if it literally costs so much to buy and use it?"
16-3-2-1,">Like how the fuck is this a viable currency if it literally costs so much to buy and use it?It's not a viable currency.If all other evidence didn't prove it to you, the fact that they forked etherium should.  Imagine if the US forked USD.  Like, seriously, try and imagine that happening to a real currency in the modern era."
16-3-2-1-1,whats forking
16-3-2-1-1-1,"Essentially, if there is a discrepancy in the block chain the only functional work around is to build a new chain off the back of the older one, creating a new coin and new ledger. Holders than have to choose which side to go with. There have been 100 or so forks just on bitcoin and 74 of those still exist.It'd be like if during the 08 recession the US started issuing dollars backed by a gold standard, but let everyone choose for themselves which they wanted to spend or accept. Pick correctly!"
16-3-2-1-1-2,"It basically means creating a new version of a thing, like making a fork in a road. The old version continues to exist as well as the new version, so in a way you end up with two parallel versions of that things. It's normal in software development, but now (since cryptocurrencies are technically just software) there are ""forks"" of various coins. Which makes little sense as you can probably imagine."
16-3-2-1-1-3,"Patching basically. New code replacing old code. Ethereum tried to do this silly organizational thing, bad things happened and they decided they'd rather go back in time before the bad thing happened because money and immutable is a *really* dumb idea. Imagine a bug that wiped out your whole economy and trying to herd cats to pretend that it never existed so that you all don't go down in flames."
16-3-2-1-2,"**Vitalik:** Code is law, blockchains are immutable**DAO:** Thanks for the money suckers**Vitalik:** We must roll back transactions to protect peopleWhenever someone touts the superiority of code-enforced contracts, I refer to Ethereum Classic, the only blockchain upon which that principle is followed."
16-3-2-1-3,The existence of forking also debunks the claims that crypto is truly decentralized.
16-3-2-2,"I think you demonstrated the primary use case - you can use it as cash when governments won't let you use banks to do what you want, at least without arresting you for it. Reasons people use crypto include evading international sanctions and money laundering. Turns out those are popular things, though usually illegal."
16-3-4,I tried the whole mining thing but gave up because I had not a very good clue what I was doing to begin with. My miners wouldn't mine period.
16-3-4-1,"Honestly, I was shocked how easy and straight forward it is. Download a program, set up an account and hit run. Obvs there are more complicated methods, and if you wanna be as efficient as possible it's more complicated, but getting a miner running couldn't be easier.Only did it for a month or two though. The electricity costs in my area meant that I was barely making a profit, and more importantly on an ethical level I just couldn't justify that stupid waste of energy"
16-3-4-1-1,"I was going to say: what were the gains? I've heard power consumption, memory load, and wear can be a big negative. Also I dropped my cellphone number into some fucking service line and for like a good 3 weeks I was getting the most scammy calls from UK phone numbers."
16-3-4-1-1-1,back in the day (2009 or 2010?) I mined 0.75 bitcointhen I traded it for a $75 amazon gift card because Bitcoin dropped from $150 to $100
16-3-4-1-1-1-1,So you actually got something? That is more than most people are going to get out.
16-3-4-1-1-2,the people i knew who mined back in the day leeched off of their school's computer lab or work computers
16-3-4-1-1-2-1,"That is the best efficiency if you asked me. My work place that was out in the middle of nowhere cornfields, still had the best internet. Just pop the computer in a far cabinet in the room and lock it under password. Hhaha!"
16-4,"It's hilarious how BTC is supposed to be independent of government regulation, but it's chasing the Fed."
16-4-1,"It seems pretty correlated to the stock market right now too. When it kept dropping over the weekend, I was thinking it doesn't look good for stocks on Monday. Now stock futures are down bad."
16-4-2,Someone once pointed out how the 'value' or 'worth' of Bitcoin is measured in real world US Dollars. And how people fixate on that exchange rate almost entirely. Looking at it from that perspective helped me realize it's all a pump and dump.
16-4-2-1,"It's fundamental to how crypto currencies work.  They are not tied to a market that rises or falls.  Its only avenue for growth is people putting more money in it.  And when it becomes worth enough, people yank their money out.  The pump and dump as mentioned.We watch it happen over and over with each new hit crypto.  How much did ole Musky boy make by pumping Doge and then fucking off with his winnings?Literally, HOW can it be anything other than a pump and dump scam under these conditions?"
16-4-2-1-1,"Yeah. Crypto is only not a pump n dump when it's actually being used to buy and sell things.Until btc is on Amazon and Walmart, it ain't going anywhere legitimately."
16-5,The GPUs are returning.Nature is healing.
17,Chinese Bitcoin mine being packed up after ban

17-1-1,"ASIC machines, has lots of microchips designed to only solve mathematical calculations in order to mine for cryptocurrency (mostly bitcoin), they verify transactions and are paid in crypto for it. Not connected to each other but to the same network"
17-1-2,"They're specialized hardware purpose-designed for a few relevant algorithms that are controlled by some remote master.Consider them akin to self-contained highly-specific GPUs with custom firmware, their own PSU, some integrated memory, a CPU handling a control interface & an integrated NIC (I'm not quite certain they're being controlled over an IP network, but in any case close-enough a description).They're not quite GPUs, of course, nor is there any guarantee they're using PCIe as an internal communication bus. Purpose-specific computing hardware throws in a lot of other options. For example ."
17-2,At first I thought those were the portable containment devices they used in Ghostbusters.
17-2-1,Me too!!! 
17-3,I hope the people in charge of this go completely bankrupt.
17-3-1,"Knowing China and knowing how much all this costs I'm guessing the owner or investor were/are well off government officials. Most of my Chinese friends are poor, only people I ever met with any real money were connected to the government in some form."
17-3-2,"You are insane, everyone is just trying to make living one way or another and has families, wishing anyone bankruptcy is insane"
17-3-2-1,Fuck corpos.
17-3-3,Yeah sue the bitcoin CEO 
17-3-3-1,The owner of the mine dumbass.
17-3-3-2,"If they do that, he has to turn bitcoin off!"
17-3-3-2-1,
17-4,A single one of those units has a power consumption of 1.3kW.
17-4-1,Let's do the math how much ATM uses while they just sit idly. I'll let you figure out they're about the same power consumption...what now?
17-4-1-1,"The power usage of an ATM can vary depending on the specific model and features of the machine. However, on average, an ATM uses around 500-800 watts per hour. This is roughly equivalent to the power usage of a small home appliance such as a microwave. Some older ATMs or those with additional features, such as check scanning or coin dispensing, may use more power, while newer, more energy-efficient models may use less."
17-5,man. It actually hurt the fucking planet
17-5-1,Yeah what a colossal waste of energy and resources
17-5-2,Crypto was such a stupid experiment.
17-5-2-1,Still is
17-5-2-1-1,Nah. She’s dead.
17-5-2-2,crypto is still here btw
17-5-2-2-1,^ This is what happens when you say something factual about crypto on Reddit. Lmfao
17-5-2-2-1-1,"What happens when you miss the point of the comment you're replying to. Court of public opinion has shifted HEAVILY against crypto. Obviously, crypto still exists, but the experiment is over."
17-5-2-2-1-1-2,So the experiment is over because the court of public opinion has shifted heavily against crypto? What was the experiment in the first place?
17-5-2-2-1-1-2-1,Yes because that is how the market works. The experiment was does block chain based decentralized currency provide a useful alternative to state backed currency.
17-5-2-2-1-1-3,Just means it's the end of the bubble. Crypto for many is a way to make quick money. The moment it starts getting valued again is when sentiment turns.
17-5-2-2-1-1-3-1,"So crypto is just gambling with extra steps. The money isn't made out of thin air. Some people win, some people lose. That's the law of capitalism, baby."

17-5-2-2-2,No shit
17-5-3,"cool, now do fiat currencies and the destruction it has caused"
17-5-3-1,"Fiat has caused less destruction than gold and silver have caused. Throughout much of recorded history militaries put enslaved populations to work for the sole purpose of mining so they could pay their soldiers in specie, that hasn’t happened with fiat. Not having these minerals because of sheer scarcity also meant that most people were dirt poor, which is why movements like bimetallism were so popular as recently as the 19th century. This commotion over fiat makes very little sense, why should capital be limited to an arbitrary commodity like gold or silver? That benefits no one except those that can access a resource which is inconsistent in supply and easily hoarded, much more so than fiat."
17-5-3-1-1,"literally all fiat currencies eventually collapse after a given time and the wealth destruction it has caused is insane, only the british pound sterling and USD is one of the longest lasting as of right now"
17-5-3-2,the thing about fiat currency is that you can actually use them to purchase goods and services

So it's like putting space heaters outside, not even heating something usefull.It was going on such a large scale that it had a significant impact on the world's electricity consumption. Pretty much going to waste."
17-5-5-1-1-1-1,Then you may be shocked to find out that close to 2/3rds of the electricity produced is lost before it even reaches your meter.
17-5-5-1-1-1-1-1,I know. It's also problem that need to be worked on. Decentralisation of it's production and storage will help.
17-5-5-1-1-3,"More energy use means more energy production, and a lot of the time more energy production means more pollution due to many places not using clean sources of energy. Its not that complex, its just the transitive property"
17-5-5-1-1-4,"> as we all know, there is clean energy as well.> Doubt China is using clean energyWas going to respond and point out the problems with your logic, but you seem to have already done it for me."
17-5-5-1-1-5,"There is no such thing as clean energy, only less dirty energy. Wind requires turbine blades that are largely unrecyclable, PV solar uses large quantities of rare metals for the panels, hydro needs gigantic dams that cause major disruptions to delicate river ecosystems. It's better to use these energy sources than coal, but it is still a toll on the Earth that shouldn't be spent on frivolous nonsense like crypto."
17-5-5-2,"\-generation of heat that is wasted\-heavy load for electric grid. Or use of generators running on fossil fuel.\-production of tons of e-junk, that is often useless for anything else"
17-5-5-2-1,It's better now we are back to just regular wastage levels.
17-5-5-2-1-1,E-waste will always be made. But reducing senselessly wasted resources is good.

18,Everyone said they would love to buy their Crypto 80% more down. Now that it happened they are paralyzed out of fear instead.A throwback to maybe Oct/Nov of last year where Bitcoin was having its height of the run and everything seemed primed for 100k EOY. People were happy and euphoric. The only complaint and the big one was to have bought more.
18-1,I'm not paralyzed.. just broke
18-1-1,Financially paralyzed it is then
18-1-1-1,"You're what we call, new poor."

18-1-3-2,"Food won't make you money, go buy"
18-1-4,Invested in the last ten dips and it kept dipping . I'm out of money now

18-1-4-1-2,This is what I will say every day as I commute in. Mining Fiat.   Fucking genius
18-1-4-1-3,Let's go 8-5 here I come
18-1-4-2,"There are 2 kinds of bear market posts:- Your favourite crypto is 80% down, why aren't you buying not now? Fundamentals haven't changed.- Don't try to catch a falling knife. If it's 80% down, doesn't mean it can't fall another 80%.Just refer one kind of post to the other ."
18-1-4-2-1,I have £70 in alt-coins. Cashed up the rest I had in 'good' coins. I invested small amounts for 18 months and had a nice amount then the crash knocked out about 50% so I thought fuck this I'm out. I'll start buying small amounts again now it's this low *just incase* but only small amounts.I had 0.25 BC years ago when it was £200 then cashed in when it hit £1000 now I have FOMO.
18-1-4-2-1-1,"StrangeYou say you have FOMO but you sold all your ""good"" coins?At least this is what I get from your reply"
18-1-4-2-1-1-1,Yes. I don't have exactly have loads of money so cut my losses. The market fell even further so now I'm FOMO-ing incase it rebounds.
18-1-4-2-1-2,I have 0.29 btc. Used to have more.Taking this opportunity to reaccumulate.
18-1-4-2-3,"while the falling knife thing can be applicable to pretty much anything, its usually said more towards the shitcoins than the ""top projects""."
18-1-4-2-4,Accurate as fuck
18-1-4-3,"Ahem, yes, let me just amend my earlier statement to what I meant to say, which is: I'll buy when it's 80% down from 80% down."
18-1-4-5,You invested for 10 days... I'm not surprised you're scared.
18-1-4-5-1,Running out of money is scary. Running out of money when market is down is super scary.
18-1-4-5-1-1,Imagine having money to run out

18-2-2-2,Me too. I throw in everything during the bullrun from Februar till October… learned my lesson I guess ;(
18-2-3,It’s not -80% down either.
18-2-3-1,"You right, down 90%"
18-2-3-1-1,I'm getting sweaty all of a sudden
18-2-3-1-1-1,Here's a towel
18-2-3-1-1-1-1,"Thanks, this towel will make a great rope."
18-2-3-1-1-1-1-1,Do you think it fits 2?
18-2-3-1-2,its 70% down don't create FUD. Just a normal dip nothing to be worried about
18-2-3-1-2-1,Gotta love a currency that can suddenly be worth 70% less in a year's time.
18-2-3-1-2-2,70% down shouldn't be normal
18-2-4,Yeah same here
18-3,More like paycheck is eaten up by inflation and dont have money to spend on crypro
18-3-1,I hear that. Got a 6% raise this year and was excited... then inflation blew past that with ease. Now it feels like I got a pay-*cut* instead.
18-3-1-1,Got a 2% raise this year. The news was given to me by my director who is earning half a million a year + other benefits. He also asked for feedback on whether I was expecting this epic raise this year and what are my goals for my next year. That 5 minute call pissed me off so much.. Total impact on my income is around $180 a month. Feeling rich.
18-3-1-1-1,"For anyone looking to math out the above, OP likely makes ~$135k a year pre-tax.But yeah I agree, treating 2% like it’s revolutionary is silly.Edit: if the $180 is pre-tax it’s more like $108k/yr."
18-3-1-1-1-1,"I wish I earned 135k a year. I wish, I wish."
18-3-1-1-1-1-1,"I just took 2% = $2160 ($180 a month raise * 12 months), so yearly pay would be $108k if the $180 was the pre-tax raise, or about $130k if it was your take home amount after tax. Maybe my math is wrong somewhere."
18-3-1-1-1-3,What this results in after tax? Genuinely curious. Approximation is fine.
18-3-1-1-1-3-1,"Likely right around $90-100k. Depends how much they contribute to a 401k, pay for health insurance, whether they pay state income taxes (not all states have income tax) etc."
18-3-1-1-1-3-1-1,"So by the official inflation numbers he should've got a raise over ~$8600/yr after taxes to stay even, by the real likely current inflation ~20-25k. That's an extra BTC, and frankly by what people buy most (gas/food) most of us are likely seeing 40% since ~2020. If a black Monday type event happens that is going to steam roll a lot of usPreEdit: Heavily drinking currently my math is likely wrong but someone will correct it I'm sure, it doesn't need to be exact you get the point"
18-3-1-2,"I feel this in my soul, it seems every time I makeMore money hourly it feels like I’m making no progress, possibly even losing some. Used to use $20 to get my tank to 3/4, I put almost 40 in yesterday and got half a tank :l grocery bills have gone from $100 a week to almost 300, and every bit of money I had in crypto and the stock market is basically in the red(minus gme, which is my only green rn)"
18-3-1-2-1,>$100 to almost 300What the fuck are you buying? What the shit are you spending $1200 on at the grocery store a month?
18-3-1-2-1-1,"It’s not always 300, but I eat keto and have a 3 yo. It’s probably closer to 7-800 a month in groceries"
18-3-1-2-1-1-2,Still… I eat a whole chicken breast every day for lunch and eat 1/2lb of ground turkey for dinner. And my grocery bills have not exceeded $300 per month. I understand children are expensive for we spend $300 maybe $350 for two very active adults that burn 1500-2000 calories during the weekday. You may need to start revisiting what and where you buy my man. Because that’s really excessive for an adult and a child.
18-3-1-2-2,40$ for 'half a tank'?  We pay €2.4/liter here. That's 9.5$ a gallon...
18-3-1-2-2-1,And you have fantastic public transportation.  It's almost non-existent here.
18-3-1-2-2-1-1,"""fantastic"" is quite an overstatement.   Yes, we have public transportation, but for example when I used to go to college, it would take <20 minutes by car.   It would take 45+ minutes by bus, not including the time to walk to a bus station, waiting for the bus, often having to take the next one because the first one was either late, full, or simply didn't show up and the fact I'd be at school 30 minutes before my next class.  So class at 8.30 ment leaving at home at 8.10 if going by car, but leaving at 7 when taking a bus."
18-3-1-4,"Pay raises are shit yall. Start pushing for new positions and new jobs. It's easier said than done but not only is it necessary, the more people that push for their worth the more money everyone makes."
18-3-1-4-1,"Until the recession and layoffs come, then high wage and low seniority might bite you in the ass. Your method could pay off nicely, but it does come with risks, as does everything."
18-3-2,"Fuel is up almost 100%, disposable income is almost non-existent rn"
18-3-2-2,Bro how much are you spending on gas that doubling that would ruin your budget.
18-3-2-2-1,In america the most sold car for the last several decades is a Ford F-150. Folks are also super into having a 3/2 with a yard and most can’t afford that so they commute into the city for work. You factor in an hour commute and a gas guzzling monster like a truck or a suv you end up with these issues.
18-3-2-2-1-1,Who the fuck commutes an hour
18-3-2-2-1-1-1,ALOT of people. Most of people who work Washington DC lives in VA. NJ to NYC is like a 45 min commute. People that live in ATL deal with that every day. An hour commute is super common these days.
18-3-2-3,>Fuel is up almost 100%Holy crap! Where do you live?
18-3-2-3-1,"Pretty much any country that isn't exporting oil right now. First COVID messed up supply, then Russia, and now prices are +80% or more compared to 2018."
18-3-4,Time to walk or ride everywhere.These 80km drives in cold and wet are gonna be fun 
18-3-5,This!
18-4,"I assume people think that it might dip even further so they're waiting for the best possible opportunity to buyPersonally, I DCA small amounts weekly to eliminate the stress"
18-4-1,I can't even time getting my kids into the car right. Why the heck would I try and time crypto?DCA is the way.
18-4-1-1,Time in the car > timing the car. When will people learn smh
18-4-1-1-1,Not with these gas prices.
18-4-1-1-1-1,punny
18-4-1-1-2,First thing I learned with kids
18-4-1-1-2-1,"Biggest thing is when you put them in their car seat, you absolutely have to savor that 5 seconds of free time you get while walking around the car.  I live for that shit."
18-4-1-2,"> Why the heck would I try and time crypto?Well, in my case, I'm so fuckin poor I can't exactly afford to chip away at things slowly. Like, DCA is absolutely the best idea conceptually. But also I've already lost so much on this the last year I can't afford another dip even if I DCA. So I'm either out and hold what I already have, or get super lucky and actually time near a bottom."
18-4-1-2-1,">I'm so fuckin poorGet out, ffs.  Stop gambling your whole future on crypto."
18-4-1-3,I on the other hand am Nostradamus himself and will time the bottom to within 10 cents. Different vibes for different people
18-4-1-4,As long as it eventually goes back up.  This idea by the community that DCA is some guaranteed strategy is head scratching.
18-4-1-4-1,"Well I mean it is. In the past year, one of my alts has been up $8k twice but I didn't sell both times because I thought it might rise more. Now it's down 75%.Another was down 90% I only chucked $10 into that, threw another $20 into it, now it's only down 40%.DCA means you'll recover your position faster or even profit faster."
18-4-1-5,"Most underrated comment.The only thing I can time is when to sit in the toilet for a dump, and even then, I don't always get it right"
18-4-1-5-1,I shit my pants one time on an elevator so no timing the toilet for me
18-4-1-5-1-1,"Why did you shit your pants on an elevator? Was it a particularly fast elevator? Did the cable snap like in the films, and then it stopped suddenly 1 inch from the floor because it had another cable? I'm intrigued now."
18-4-1-5-1-1-1,I went out on a date to a hibachi place and it didn't sit well with me . It was a date with my current wife so yeah lol . It was the elevator to my apartment btw.
18-4-2,"Exactly, even if now isn't the bottom of the bottom, it's definitely low enough for me to start averaging down.This time in a few years I'll just be happy that I started at some point around now, I won't care about specific dates..."
18-4-2-2,"Yep, I get paid on Wednesday so imma buy on Wednesday and then go backwoods camping for a week. Pure blissful wilderness and I'm not going to think a bit about my investments because my phone doesn't get service out there anyways."
18-4-3,That's the mistake to chase the bottom and has never ended well.DCA or buying at a price that seems cheap to you is smarter. Don't try to time the markets.
18-4-3-1,So you think catching the falling knife is better? Lol
18-4-3-2,> buying at a price that seems cheap to you is smarter. Don't try to time the markets.Buying at a time that seems cheap to you is literally timing the market.
18-4-3-2-1,"Is it? I thought timing the market meant buying at the bottom and selling at the top, and that’s very hard to do.This price does feel cheap to me, so I’ve been buying for the last 3 days. I might go much lower still, and I’ll buy more with what I can spare if it does."
18-4-3-2-1-1,What if the price never rebounds? There will never be another corona virus stimulus again and regulations might come down hard.
18-4-3-2-1-1-1,"Then you will fail to time the market. You’re free to believe what you want. I believe crypto has gotten too big to fail. Sure many projects will die, and who the hell knows when the bear market will end, but I feel confident that it will eventually turn around"
18-4-3-2-1-2,How can the price feel cheap when it's arbitrary? What metric are you using to say that it's cheap?
18-4-3-2-1-2-1,Do you think bitcoin will return to 65k and higher? Would you prefer to buy at 65k or 23k?Sure it might go lower still but that doesn’t mean these prices are not cheap as well.
18-4-3-2-1-2-1-1,"That doesn't explain how it's cheap. It's certainly cheaper now than it was a month ago but on an absolute basis, how can one declare it to be cheap when there's no intrinsic value to make that determination?"
18-4-4,That's exactly my case.I'm from a third world country (yadda yadda) and DCA isn't an option so I have to pick my buys *really* carefully.I'm just waiting for it to dip more.
18-4-4-3,DCA is always an option if you have the ability to buy on an exchange.
18-4-4-3-1,"Did I mentioned that cryptocurrency is illegal in my country ? So no, no transfer of fiat from my bank to an exchange. I have to do a lot of gymnastics to buy any amount of crypto."
18-4-4-3-1-1,"No you didn’t, but you can always put it into DAI or USDC and use an exchange that doesn’t to KYC or a DEX to break up your buys over a timeframe."
18-4-5,"This is my strategy too, if people much smarter and wealthier then me can't time the market, I do not even have to try. I'll just dca and hope for the best."
18-5,"Most people have been “buying the dip” all the way down and are now running out of dry powder, or are already out."
18-5-1,This
19,"Bitcoin finally decouples from the stock market!Guys, this is the moment we have been waiting for - Bitcoin has finally decoupled from the stock market!While the stock market has been pumping for five days straight, Bitcoin completely ignores it and continues to dump further down.I've waited for this moment since 2017 and it has finally arrived! We did it, congratz to everyone who HODLed long enough to witness this historic moment. No more price movement following the stock market, from now on we just dump no matter what, what a blessing to be part of this community and the crypto space! God bless us all."
19-1,I’m just going to pretend like I’m on a real rollercoaster and close my eyes until this is all over.
19-1-1,"It works because in both cases, I wanna throw up."
19-1-3,"Roller coaster   stops at zero ground,  you should jump off wen pump"
19-1-3-1,This guy trades
19-1-3-1-1,"Is that the right word? “Trades?” This guy. Now I have an image in my head of myself jumping off of a literal roller coaster, and there’s just no need for that."
19-1-3-1-2,spoken like a pro
19-1-3-2,Eyes open when we go back up the hill
19-1-4,You should just enjoy the ride man. You're gonna pat yourself in the back when bull market hits.
19-1-4-1,I truely believe this. 
19-1-4-1-1,"I'd really like to be entitled to say ""I was there during the 20/21/22 or whatever year itll take until the bull market."
19-2,"It is half-decoupling guys. When stocks goes up, bitcoin goes down. When stocks down, bitcoin goes down even more."
19-2-1,Altcoins were acting like this back in 2019.
19-3,"I'm just here like ""yeah, it's almost time to buy"""
19-3-1,">almostIt's words like that that will make you say ""I should have bought the dip when I had the chance"" in the future lol"
19-3-1-1,"People told me this in November, December, January, February, March, April, now May....I'm confident with my assessment. Even if I miss this dip and buy in at double the current price I'm still better off than if I'd bought at all the dips this sub told me to. I trust my instincts more than I trust the sentiment of this sub.The doom and gloom and total loss of hope in the last week was my buy signal. Im now prepared to buy but still waiting for further drops. I don't need to make a quick buck on a little spike.Still holding my btc, never sold. And definitely glad I didn't DCA over the past 6 months."
19-3-1-1-1,"All signs point to the market continuing its bear run for the next few months at least. Although I don't think people should sell as all hope is not lost, I think the market will go down further than this."
19-3-1-1-1-1,"Oh man, the party has hardly started."
19-3-1-1-1-2,I think it's gonna be a slow bleed down another 30% or so over the next months
19-3-1-1-1-3,That seems contradictory. If the market will go down further than this then you should sell and buy back later.
19-3-1-1-1-3-1,"No it's ego insurance. They're either correct or they make money, if they sell out to take advantage of the drop they're predicting then there is a chance of being wrong and losing money at the same time."
19-3-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Actually I do agree I think selling now and buying back at a lower price is probably a good strategy, I think the chances of a sustained rally in the short term are very low, the issue as always is timing the market and picking the right time to do it."
19-3-1-1-2,"I have the same impression as you. The mood is set, but it didn't have an effect. We saw 24k for a bit, we'll test that again.The stock market will pump first, crypto will capitulate and then accumulate before starting to react.I shouldn't have doubted myself last may, when we I thought we were going to 20k again. We didn't go due to manipulation from USDT amd exchanges. But here we are. Like clockwork."
19-3-1-1-3,This one invests
19-3-1-1-5,Did you buy yet?
19-3-1-1-5-1,Nope lol.
19-3-1-1-5-1-1,Hahaha damn what's the price target you're waiting for?
19-3-1-1-5-1-1-1,"I don't think I'm in a rush. I see no indicators that markets will go green any time this year. I'm just reminding myself of that when I'm struggling with fomo. I will probably have plenty of time to buy as btc chugs along at bottom. When people start thinking it will never recover at all, that's when I'm in."
19-3-1-2,Nah just buy now. And then buy again lower. That's what I did for the past six months.
19-3-1-2-1,To be fair how much more would you have been able to buy if you had just waited until now to buy instead?
19-3-1-2-1-1,Yeah but how bad would you feel if we were at 80k and didn't DCA
19-3-1-2-1-1-1,"I’m following your strategy too, it’s difficult putting money in each week and seeing my total value keep dropping regardless but I keep telling myself this is how money is actually made (as opposed to buying on the way up). Fingers crossed in a few years it pays off"
19-3-1-2-1-1-1-2,Buy some lottery tickets while you're at it. Same thing.
19-3-1-2-1-1-1-3,"Probably you should keep a fixed ammount in ,not add continously.Use the rest to buy stocks."
19-3-1-2-1-1-2,Do you expect 80k coming soon?
19-3-1-2-1-1-2-1,Yeah unless by soon you mean within 10 minutes of drooling at charts
19-3-1-2-1-1-2-2,Should be 100k by the end of the year
19-3-1-2-1-1-3,We aren't lol
19-3-1-4,This is why you should always be DCAing.
19-3-1-4-1,"DCAing *both ways*. DCA in when it's low, DCA out when it's high."
19-3-1-4-1-1,This is the way
19-3-1-4-1-1-1,If you wanna get taxed to hell
19-3-2,Almost? I saw bullish rsi divergence
19-4,Is this the flippening we've all been waiting for? /s
19-4-1,"It's definitely *a* flippening, just maybe not *the* flippening"

19-4-1-1-1,All that’s left to do is beatus the meatus
19-4-1-1-2,"No.  I've seen that.  I liked it this one, less so."

19-5-1-2-1-1-1,"People will move to ETC probably so ETH will take a dip with the merge.Also there are still question marks about PoS and if it can offer the same guarantess and a fair deal as PoW.There have been a few concerning arguments about PoS as a mechanism as PoW assured consensus by embedding it's chain of trust in hardware ,or hardware compute power.In PoS if someone holds loads of ETH a 31% attack is feasible and PoS is much more unpredictable and harder to analyze and check for security holes.Read this "
19-5-1-2-2,$0.00000000?
19-5-1-2-2-1,Can't go any lower then that! I'll buy a ton at that price.
19-5-1-3,Hooray! 
19-5-1-4,ETH is leading the decoupling.
19-5-1-5,Woohoo! To the Earth’s core!
19-5-2,!
19-5-2-1,Oh man that's a hilarious gif.  Dude looks like he just snorted a Scarface level of coke and then got told he's just won an all expenses paid trip to Majorca.
19-5-2-1-1,What a great description lol.
19-5-4,"As someone who started buying near the all-time high, I am down a lot.. gonna keep DCAing"
19-5-4-1,"This is the way. Seriously. I tell everyone, don't try to time it. Just dollar cost average into crypto with your spare money, and do that for 4 years. Literally, just do it for 4 years. And then look back and see how you did -- and I think you will be pleased."
19-5-4-1-1,1.4 years down.LETS FUCKING GO
19-5-4-3,"I started like you years ago. Everything is good now. Don’t panic, zoom out and DYOR."
19-5-4-4,"I started sometime like January 5th of this year?  Lol, so not quite at the all time high, but man I wish I'd waited a few more months lmao.  At least I bought a bit at a time and rode the rollercoaster down the dip lol, buying some at different levels, so while I bought some at high prices, I've also bought some at steadily lower prices.  I'll be buying more as time goes on.  Just gotta be selective in this market and figure out what crypto's are smart buys and which ones will fold.  If we buy the right stuff, this is a great buying opportunity while this slump/recession lasts."
19-5-4-4-1,I'll definitely be sticking to BTC and ETH. Maybe some algo as well
20,Will This Be the First Country Bankrupted by Crypto? It’s been a year since El Salvador adopted bitcoin as currency — things are not going well.
20-1,My heart goes out to the people but the rest is hilarious
20-1-1,My heart goes out to the people who are too ignorant of monetary economics to realize that Bitcoin will inevitably grow until it consumes all other currencies and dominates the global economy.But everyone will buy Bitcoin at the price they deserve.
20-1-1-1,I say let every man suffer the consequences of their actions. There’s no point in trying to make people see common sense.
20-1-1-2,"Does it take watching more than one ""Buy Bitcoin"" YouTube videos to stop being ""too ignorant"" and to ""realize"" that?"
20-1-1-2-1,It takes thinking for yourself and studying monetary history so it might be beyond your reach.  Sorry =/
20-1-1-2-1-1,"What do your Beanie Babies coins have to do with ""monetary history""?"
20-1-1-2-1-1-1,It warms my heart to know people like you who mock Bitcoin while failing to understand money with your smug ignorance will be the very last people to use Bitcoin as money.You will buy it at the price you deserve.Have fun staying poor
20-1-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Perhaps if you keep repeating that, it will somehow become true?No. It won't. Bitcoin is unsuitable as currency, by design. It is slow, volatile, unable to scale. It is immutable and transparent and thus unusable: no one wants their purchases to be advertised to the world forever, let alone people in power.You can choose to wait for it to become mainstream and replace all the currencies in the world. Make sure to get seated though, or you might stand until you die. I'm sure you already lost a lot and your only hope is for it to get back up.Have fun betting on a born dead horse."
20-1-1-2-1-1-2,Exactly. You are right. Everything is beanie babies and trading cards. The true financial system is the barter system.  It got out of hand while a man and a group of men wanted to become rich and have slaves. Ahh. How we forgotten history.   The BTC thing is good it the disciples are forcing it so the whole coiners can become rich.   They are so invested they only now need it to scale.  All greed
20-2,Pardon my ignorance but I remeber El Savador only put less than 10% of their investment into crypto. The rest went to bond and precious metals.
20-2-1,"I believe the issue is due more to their overall position. They sought a loan of $1.3b from the IMF last year but couldn't get it because of the bitcoin law. They're deeply in debt and spiralling, so not being able to secure those extra funds as well as seeing 60% of their investment in btc being wiped off leaves them in a less stable position than ever. And yet the president keeps doubling down and insisting that bitcoin will save them."
20-2-1-1,He’s a wallstreetsbets moderator?
20-2-1-1-1,No... More like r/bitcoin
20-2-1-1-1-1,I'm not seeing the difference
20-2-1-1-1-1-2,"Wsb is genuinely not dumb enough to blindly fall for crypto scams. Which is not to say they won't gamble away all their money on them, just they they are aware that is what they are doing. No pretense of ""oh no this is totally a valid and safe investment in the future"""
20-2-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Totally. WSB is yolo gambling, Blockchain is FOMO Greater Fools"
20-2-1-1-1-1-3,I mean I guess they are both filled with individuals of questionable intelligence but at least wall Street bets admits their incompetence.
20-2-1-1-1-1-4,"WSB call themselves retards, not gullible idiots. They are not stupid enough to actually believe the shit you can sometimes see in crypto subs all the while thinking they are misunderstood geniuses."
20-2-1-1-2,You’ll all be sorry when El Salvador’s got the highest GDP in the world in 5 years! hodl hodl hodl! pump pump pump! /s
20-2-1-2,He’s tucked his tail between his legs recently but you’re right. Nayib is a complete idiot who’s easily swayed by Bitcoin bros who lowkey wanted to use El Salvador as a pump and dump scheme. It worked and now he’s not as loud about crypto as he once was.
20-2-1-3,Maybe Bitcoin investors should replace the IMF if those investors dont like IMF lending standards.
20-2-1-3-1,You’re pretending those crypto funds want double the risk.There’s always money in monkey ETF art.
20-2-1-3-1-1,You’re getting your scams mixed up. An ETF is a fund traded on the stock exchange used by hedge funds and other institutional investors to manipulate stocks within the fund. The monkey art are NFTs used to launder money and avoid taxes
20-2-1-3-1-1-1,No no no… You’re thinking of the banana stand.There’s always money in the banana stand.
20-2-1-3-1-1-1-1,"I mean, it’s one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars?"
20-2-1-3-1-2,"Well, the IMF shouldnt absorb the risk on behalf of those same Bitcoin investors."
20-2-1-3-1-3,You don’t even know what an ETF is yet you use the word confidently. You are a clown.
20-2-1-3-2,Bitcoin hate is so funny.
20-2-1-3-2-1,"Thr only thing i dislke about it is the climate change impact, other than that, go ahead and trade your tulips."
20-2-1-3-2-1-1,"Fair enough. But read your post again. Joking that Bitcoin holders should come to save El Salvador is nonsensical and it implies BTC is shit, compared to the sound economy of the IMF. I am no specialist on El Salvador economy but I’m ready to bet it’s a fucked up country with a fucked up economy, high crime rates and surely lots of corruption. Tell me just how does that come to individual BTC investors to help them? Should the tulips investors have come to save say Belgium if they had purchased tulips? You wrote a hate post and later denied it. Face it."
20-2-1-3-2-1-1-1,"The IMF is there to backstop global trade and currencies, not bailout bitcoin investors even if they are nationalized bitcoin investors. If El Salvador wants to operate on Bitcoin then they should turn to bitcoin for help during these times. Make your bed and lie in it, story as old as time.Oh, and IMF help always comes with strings for reform of the underlying currencies (see Argentinian bailouts). El Salvador cant abide by those reform requirements because they dont control the currency. It is an inherent problem."
20-2-1-4,maybe he is doubling down because bitcoin was the best performing asset in the last . I understand we all have our subjective opinions but an asset which is a inflation hedge in the macro is really needed in these dire times.
20-2-1-5,So they are like every other country.
20-2-2,Sure but 10% is a very large amount when it comes to an entire country.
20-2-2-1,Most individuals would consider 10% of their money in cryptocurrency as tremendously risky.
20-2-2-1-1,I'm more a 0% kind of guy.
20-2-2-1-1-1,I’m a 100% kind of guy.
20-2-2-1-1-1-1,How does this year feel for you?You buying groceries with bitcoin these days?
20-2-2-1-1-1-1-1,"God, terrible for me. I made +150% on my initial investment over a few months, and then when the crypto crash happened lost all the way down to 25% my initial investment. Finally said fuck it and pulled out my remaining money and saying fuck crypto for good."
20-2-2-1-1-1-1-3,Just going to leave this here for future reference...
20-2-2-1-1-1-1-4,"Let's just say I didn't wanna pull out cause I lost A LOT... but I did anyways...And HOLY FUCK thank God that I did!There will be no bounce back l, gentlemen.                The cake is a lie."
20-2-2-1-1-1-1-5,I do. But more with altcoins than with btc itself.
20-2-2-1-1-1-2,Are you happy then that your buying power is 50% of what it was at the end of last year?
20-2-2-1-1-1-2-1,Are you happy that the US Dollars purchasing power has dropped 14% since the pandemic occurred and has dropped 42% since the year 2000?
20-2-2-1-1-1-2-2,"It’s 400-500% higher then it was in 2018-2019 for bitcoin. And it’s 1000% of what it was in 2018-2019 in ethereums case. Despite what may be a common meme, crypto is more of a long term game then a get rich Lambo on the moon game."
20-2-2-1-2,"Hehe, I'm in danger."
20-2-2-1-2-1,I’m in a solid 30% danger
20-2-2-1-2-1-1,"Don't worry, because that could drop to 10% any day now."
20-2-2-1-2-1-1-1,That’s when I triple down
20-2-2-1-2-1-2,30% of nothing isn’t much so don’t worry
20-2-2-1-3,10 percent of my money is..... like 150 bucks
20-2-2-1-3-1,You need fewer avocado toasts and lattes.
20-2-2-1-3-1-1,Lol I was going to say I found the millennial but you said it better.
20-2-2-1-4,Only if you are a completely risk averse pussy.
20-2-2-5,Sure but that large amount happens to still only be... 10%
20-2-2-5-1,Losing 5 percent of a country's entire reserves is bad. And it makes people less likely to invest in your country since you made such a bad call dumping so much into crypto.
20-2-2-5-2,That they’ve lost 57% on.so they turned 10% into 4%
20-2-2-5-3,"Yea the International Monetary Fund is probably wrong on this one. Send em a message and set em straight, it's only 10%"
20-2-3,Yeah but that wouldn't make for such a nice headline
20-2-3-1,"Did you read the article? The country is in an extremely precarious situation, economically."
20-2-3-1-1,"But not mainly, if even barely because of crypto."
20-2-3-1-1-1,"More than barely.""Yes I'm on the verge of bankruptcy and may not be able to pay my rent this month. And yes I put 10% of my last paycheck into Bitcoin, which just lost over 60% of its value, why do you ask?"""
20-2-3-1-1-2,People like to hate crypto on Reddit.
20-2-3-1-1-2-1,"You say hate like it's an irrational thing, but criticizing a non regulated currency that is manipulated by rich investors and promises to only ever go up is a pretty reasonable position."
20-2-3-1-1-2-1-1,It only goes up?...
20-2-3-1-1-2-2,Because it's a scam.
20-2-3-1-1-2-2-1,It's a scam for those that are dumb
20-2-3-3,Nor a sensational one.
20-2-3-3-1,"Crypto deniers and wall street bros get a hard on at the chance of this bad PR for Bitcoin. May not be as nice for you, but it's definitely great for them"
20-2-4,"Also, it’s pretty easy for a virtually already bankrupt company to go bankrupt, regardless of the investment. Poor monetary policy and bad governance likely plays a 100x bigger role"
20-2-4-1,"Focusing on Bitcoin as a national policy IS bad governance,.. so, yes?But also, Bitcoin is too volatile to be a functional currency.  It’s fundamentally a commodity.  Similar to, but much worse than, gold."
20-2-4-1-2,"Not a fan of bitcoin, but how is it worse than gold?Edit: thanks everyone for the explanations, and big thanks to downvoting someone trying to learn"
20-2-4-1-2-1,Gold is probably no where near as volatile as bitcoin is.
20-2-4-1-2-2,"Gold is a tangible thing, and has uses in the physical world so will always have some base level of demand.  Bitcoin is not."
20-2-4-1-2-2-1,Aluminum used to cost more than gold.
20-2-4-1-2-2-1-1,"Before the current electrochemical refining processes were invented to convert raw aluminum ores into metallic aluminum, aluminum was rarer then gold, and therefore more valuable. There are other metals and elements that are more valuable than gold per gram, namely rhodium, iridium, and palladium.  Some of the lanthanides and actinides are also way up there too."
20-2-4-1-2-2-2,"Gold is also more difficult to obtain, and more difficult to exchange for goods and services.  It is easier to counterfeit, though.Are your emails tangible? Do they have value?"
20-2-4-1-2-4,"Because Gold exists in the real world, it's tangible. It's also one of the most conductive metals on the planet I believe and so outside of how cool it looks, it will jave a function in tons of high value electronics."
20-2-4-1-2-5,Gold doesn’t drop 80% of its value in a day. Many cryptocurrencies do
20-2-5,losing access to IMF funds is the bigger deal for them
20-3,">When Bukele announced plans for Bitcoin City, he was also evoking the legend of the fabled “Bitcoin Citadel.” In 2013, reddit user Luka Magnotta published a post claiming that he was a time traveler from the future. In this future, there are no central banks, bitcoin maximalists and early adopters live like kings in walled cities. Everyone else toils on the margins of a collapsed society. What was intended to be a cautionary tale for crypto’s future has become an idealized vision for some crypto enthusiasts. For El Salvador though, a small, powerful elite juxtaposed against a mass of disenfranchised people struggling to survive is the story of the country at any point in its history. 	Dan Olson was right, hardcore crypto investors don't want to rid the world of the oppressing boot of centralised power, they just want to be the boot."
20-3-1,Weird to see Luka Magnotta casually mentioned as “Reddit user” with no mention of murder lmfao
20-3-1-1,Lol right? I had to go back and reread the name to be sure thats who they were talking about. Why is time-travelling bitcoin wizard actually less crazy than the rest of the shit he did 
20-3-1-2,"Is it the same guy, or some neckbeard using an edgy handle or reddit? Seeing that name was a bit disturbing, I live two blocks from the building where he murdered Jun Lin on Decarie.> In 2013, reddit user Luka Magnotta published a post claiming that he was a time traveler from the futureYeah, unless the psycho was posting on reddit from prison, it was an edgy neckbeard, cause he was incarcerated in summer 2012 and on trial in 2013."
20-3-1-2-1,"I had to look more into this and you’re right, it’s someone called “Luka_Magnotta” lol. Dan Olson (or whoever) has probably never been on Reddit or heard of the guy and made an easy but hilarious mistake."
20-3-1-3,this timeline has to be a fucking joke.
20-3-2,"""This go around I'll be the landlord and you'll be the serf!""Literally Libertarianism in a nutshell."
20-3-2-1,That doesn't sound like libertarianism to me.
20-3-2-1-1,"Libertarianism - at least right-leaning flavors of it - tend to be entirely okay with strong hierarchies, as long as they're not state-driven.Replace 'serf' with 'wage slave' and it's pretty accurate. There's a reason why anarcho-capitalism (which is basically libertarian ideas taken to their extreme) often gets criticised as neo-feudalism.It's not okay to force people to work by threat of punishment, but it's okay to set up an extremely imbalanced system where all bargaining power rests with the employer, and then provide the workers the option to work on the employer's premises - or starve. Coercion is seen as okay as long as it isn't physical in nature.The workers in the right-libertarian system are not serfs and are allowed to move, but the vast majority of them are nevertheless incapable of bettering their lot in life because they have no bargaining power."
20-3-2-1-1-1,"At least Russian serfs got tons of cheap vodka from the state monopoly, ancap city serfs probably get like…K2 mislabeled as weed or something"
20-3-2-1-2,Libertarianism isn't real. It's an idiotic fantasy whose only possible outcome is full on feudalism.
20-3-2-1-3,"Maybe not in SimCity, but in the real world it’s spot on."
20-3-2-2,Proto-fascists?
20-3-2-3,"Libertarianism has many different definitions in the modern day. None accept serfdom, slavery, or any other form of non-consensual... anything."
20-3-3,"That was the plan all along lol. You can see it's just ""bros"" manipulating the market to make quick money and screwing over small investors. It's a money laundering system mixed with a scam under the guise of freedom and helping the little man become independent."
20-3-3-1,Yeah it needs to be more like the stock market where the little guys can’t be screwed over
20-3-3-1-1,Stock markets just as bad. Only they don't act like its some revolution.
20-3-5,"That’s an over broad generalization. Many crypto enthusiasts are building public goods, decentralized permissionless financial tools that disempower authoritarians. Gitcoin, Proof of Humanity, Uniswap, and Aave are just a few examples of this."
20-3-5-1,"That's why I said investors, they don't develop anything or care about any potential advantage to humanity, but nevertheless their money dictates to a great degree the direction of the ""industry"""
20-4,They could fund the country on Pupusas and be much better off.
20-4-1,Pupusas are so fucking dank. Infinitely more dank than Bitcoin.
20-5,Once you read Confessions of an Economic Hitman you never look at any of these stories the same because you realize what’s happening. Everyone should read that book
20-5-1,"Yeah, not going to lie, the fact the IMF doesn't recommend what they are doing doesn't mean much. Not that they can't be giving sound advice, but it would be like expecting the bank to tell you to stop using them, they obviously believe that you should use them..."
21,Studies show mining Bitcoin is 3.5 times more expensive than digging up actual gold
21-1,"Yes, but how are people like you and me going to know where to mine actual gold?"
21-1-1,"I spent two days hauling dirt from a former mining stream in NorCal, and spent a month of vacation at home panning it out. No joke, I only got one flake of real gold. It’s worth more to me as a lesson than money."
21-1-1-1,"Jeez, the old timers really cleaned that out, eh?"
21-1-1-1-2,Oh yeah. Your only real shot is Alaska or Northern BC/Yukon. Even there you’re better off trying to find Jade than looking for gold.
21-1-1-1-2-2,"I have to check but even the largest goldmines in the world only produces grams (double digits) per ton. Add to that, depending on where the mine is located, there are additional complications. For example, in the Philippines, I've been told by multiple persons(very reliable, they work in mining or they are in political postions) it is commonplace to have people murder for gold. From fighting over who gets to mine in a specific place to workers conspiring to kill supervisors due to being diligent in collecting the mined crushed rock samples that contain gold. Some workers make sure to leave some so they can take them home for more money. In addition they use mercury in getting the gold in the last stages. All of this happens in very dangerous and  inhumane conditions for the miners."
21-1-1-1-2-3,Gotta go into the ocean and get a dredge and excavator.  Bearing sea gold!
21-1-1-1-2-4,"You can pan for gold right in Edmonton from the river, some guys are pulling a few grams of flower gold for a few hours of sluicing."
21-1-1-1-2-4-1,How DARE someone from Edmonton speak before being spoken to! If we want an Albertans opinion we will ask Calgary.
21-1-1-1-2-4-1-1,Now I see what is wrong with this world. I mention Edmonton so now I must live in Edmonton. Nice assumption but I would never live in either Edmonton or Calgary.
21-1-1-2,I think you missed something there ….FORMER.  The guys who discover the gold get all the money.  Then the rush comes in and you do much better sellling equipment to those yahoo’s.The story of papa New Guinea is interesting here.  Some geologist dude was hiking in the 70s and on one of the mountain tops discovered one of the largest reserves of gold in world….just sitting there.   The locals didn’t have the knowledge to understand certain minerals meant gold in the ground.
21-1-1-2-1,"I love these stories in history.  It's usually followed by genocide, and destroying the land!"
21-1-1-2-1-1,"Yep! It’s always the governments at fault here too.  Like everyone wants to point the finger at the corporations, but foreign companies can’t do shit without government approval and generally their own people sell them out through either greed or incompetence."
21-1-1-2-1-1-1,“Hey I’ll give you $100 for some sugar from your kitchen”“Ok”“Here. Now I’m going to go into your kitchen and fuck your wife.”“What?! Why?! That’s not fair!”“Shouldn’t have been so greedy!”
21-1-1-4,"You’ll never see gold flakes in gold mines, they are at atom level in the dust you extract, you need chemical reaction to extract it."
21-1-1-4-1,"Depends on the type of gold in the area, some places have miniscule dust, some places have flakes, some places have nuggets, some places have a mix of all 3."
21-1-1-5,"It might surprise you to know you probably have more recoverable gold laying around storage and your house than you realize. The only problem is refining it is hazardous to health unless you have a good vent hood or lots of space outdoors away from people. Even if you don't refine it, nice to know you have the metal around you. "
21-1-2,All the places you can mine gold… you don’t want to live.
21-1-2-2,It’s how we keep gold decentralized
21-1-2-2-1,Digital gold is the better gold
21-1-2-2-1-1,It has many more benefits than any other type of gold could offer
21-1-2-2-1-2,"No, it's trash."
21-1-2-3,You can literally still pan it in Michigan rivers.
21-1-2-3-1,Is it 3 times as efficient as mining bitcoin? Cause if it was… I think people would be doing it on a large scale and ruin the profitably.
21-1-2-3-1-1,"Yea, you just throw a 3090 into the river and it beams the gold into a cold wallet. Now I sell GPUs by the river."
21-1-2-3-1-1-2,I sell my GPUs in a van down by the river
21-1-2-3-1-2,"The article doesn't go into detail about the capacity of the actual gold mining.  Is it simply panning for gold?  Some sort of sluice operation?  Or a large scale gold mining operation? Obviously a large scale gold mining operation requires a large investment.  Some places don't allow sluice boxes, and panning probably requires a lot of time.  So I  don't think it's nearly as accessible as you may think."
21-1-2-3-1-2-1,"I mean the upfront costs are a huge factor in the mining industry. Mines do not open to make money because gold spiked, they open because that deposit is going to last x-ish years and will pay itself back in years, not quarters.A crypto operation can be hacked together quite easily and by almost anyone with sufficient resources. Where as mines need years of studying, calculations and investments, not to meantion the upkeep"
21-1-2-3-1-3,People do that in Colorado you see their mining sluices on the riverbank if you go rafting.  It apparently makes around $1200 a month at least that is what my rafting guide said.
21-1-2-3-2,"There's alluvial gold all over the place here, and half a dozen 130+ year old gold mines . I really should give panning a go... seems way more entertaining than listening to a bank of RTX3080 fans all day."
21-1-2-3-2-1,"It’s crazy, but if it’s a hobby that pays… why not?"
21-1-2-4,"California? Idk, was awfully nice to visit."
21-1-2-4-1,I didn’t realize they were still finding gold in Cali. I found an article from March 9th that says otherwise.
21-1-2-4-1-1,I doubt it’s in quantities or at costs that make it lucrative for us poors.I had a friend as a kid that was into it. He always talked about prospecting in the Yukon. Wonder if he ever made it lol.
21-1-2-5,"Cyanide is heavily used to purify gold, just saying"
21-1-2-5-1,"In certain processes yes. Cyanide infused liquidation is a good way to separate and oxidice the precious metal from the waste.But while cyanide itself is harmful, there is no reason to fear it in the process or while near it. It is an extremely well protected substance"
21-1-4,"I just go out in the backyard and dig whenever I get the urge.Haven't found any gold, but damn does it feel good."
21-1-4-3,Why dig for gold and get dirty when can scuba dive in the beautiful ocean looking for hardware wallets?
21-2,The not having to be in a literal mine really sells bitcoin to me
21-2-1,"Also, what's the difference in profitability? Starting a lemonade stand is a lot cheaper than starting a car dealership, but you make a lot more money with the car dealership."
21-2-1-1,"If gold mining were cheaper than Bitcoin mining, everyone would be strapping on their Levi's and heading down into the mine. I mean, think about it, why not mine gold, and sell it for Bitcoin ? Obviously its not cheaper to mine gold, especially not in the US, where gold mining is heavily regulated. Maybe in the Congo, if you use child labor in an illegal mine, but normal Westerners just can't safely and legally get in on that 'opportunity', so gold mining is really not cheaper for us, in any real way..."
21-2-1-1-1,Well the biggest difference is mining is passive. I’ve had my 1070 mining since last year and I do literally nothing. Much easier than being in a dangerous mine doing active work. Pretty sure more people have died mining gold in mines than sitting in their homes mining crypto.
21-2-2,"What these type of articles conveniently leaves out is the fact that gold mining difficulty keeps increasing every year. If the price of gold increases, mining efforts will increase proportionately. Hence the cost and energy consumption will increase accordingly."
21-2-2-1,You just perfectly described bitcoin though lol.
21-2-2-2,Bitcoin also continues to keep increasing in difficulty every year. You new to crypto brah?
21-2-3,Don't wanna get the black lung
21-2-4,"Totally! LOL. You also have lots of other costs than only energy, costs labor, material, shipping etc. which then needs to be offset exploitation."
21-2-5,You strike a very compelling argument
21-3,"And probably 350,000x less of an initial investment to get started doing it."
21-3-1,"Lmao, exactly."
21-3-2,"I went to the south American jungle and there were often random dudes looking for gold with a bowl of water, a sieve and a shovel. The guide told us they sell it back in the city."
21-3-2-1,"Yeah you just mix in mercury, gold sticks to the mercury take it back to town and burn off the mercury and bam you’ve gold.  It does poison the area air then ground with mercury pollution but that can’t be helped,  I mean which is worse not having gold or the people around you getting mercury poisoning? Not having gold obviously."
21-3-2-1-1,"Not to mention the fish habitat destroyed, which is actually extremely important economically in many areas for simple things like aquarium fish collection (usually very sustainable)."
21-3-2-2,"A friend told me in madagascar back in the days, children used to play with pebbles that turn out to be semi precious and precious minerals. Then the chinese came"
21-3-3,And probably more profitable on the backend.
21-3-4,Don't need slaves in Africa to dig gold that ends up in European tresuries either
21-3-5,"Shhhhh... Don't spoil their ""Crypto bad"" narrative. /s"
21-4,"Motley Fool, Hedge Fund owned propaganda machine."
21-4-1,"Never read a single article written by them, not gonna read any from this point either"
21-4-2,"Their articles pop up in my iOS stock app regularly. They are so full of shit, like most of the news that appears in there."
21-4-4,"It's 3.5 times more expensive, in pure energy. They don't mention that you need to own a large tract of land with fucking gold on it."
21-4-4-1,"And mining rights, and staff, and equipment..."
21-4-4-2,"I think the point is the environmental damage from the energy consumption, but that also completely discounts the damage caused by the process of blowing up mountains for gold. I don’t really agree the environmental argument is a good one though, as harnessing electricity shouldn’t be detrimental to the environment, despite us insisting electricity has to come from coal. That being said, I think Bitcoin’s approach to mining is outdated and wasteful. Allowing ASIC mining was the greatest mistake of Bitcoin, and switching to POS will be the greatest mistake of ETH"
21-5,"Idk about that. Anytime I’ve watched one of those prospector shows, it never works out quite like they think it should. Not to mention almost getting killed by their machinery or bears in the middle of nowhere."
21-5-1,We get killed by bears in this market multiple times before we die :')
21-5-1-1,It's painful every time.
21-5-5,Searching for gold is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Mining BTC>>Using metal detectors to find gold as a commoner
22,Bitcoin’s 50% crash erases all of Elon Musk’s gains on Tesla balance sheet
22-1,No longer part of the tres comas club.
22-1-1,The car opens like this and not like this
22-1-1-1,LIKE THIS NOT LIKE THISNOT LIKE THIS
22-1-1-1-1,
22-1-2,He can always re-billionize
22-1-2-1,ROI… you know what that stands for?
22-1-2-1-1,Radio. On. Internet.
22-1-2-1-1-1,This guy fucks!
22-1-3,Like Musk could achieve something as revolutionary as putting Radio on the Internet.
22-1-3-2,This guy musks.
22-1-3-2-1,
22-1-3-3,But his car does have doors that go like this.
22-1-3-3-1,And reliability that goes like that
22-1-3-4,You mean someone else achieved it and he just invested in it and acts like he had the original invention/idea
22-1-3-4-1,Think you’re missing their reference. It’s to Silicon Valley
22-1-3-4-1-1,Wasn’t that guy based on Mark Cuban
22-1-3-4-1-1-1,"Turns out he’s more like Elon, with a purchased board seat as an angel investor and everything."
22-1-4,"“I remember the second I became a billionaire. I was ass-naked sitting right there (points at the couch where Erlich and Richard are sitting), just clicking and refreshing, clicking and refreshing, watching my stock rise. And when it happened, I popped a rod so fast, I went blind for a full minute.”"
22-1-4-1,I absolutely love that show.
22-1-4-1-2,Same 
22-1-4-1-2-1,"Same, sorta. Am I alone in finding the main guy distractingly annoying and the main plot kind of soap-opera-ish, but loving absolutely everything else? Them figuring out the hot-swap handjob algorithm is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen on TV."
22-2,He pumped but never dumped?
22-2-1,"He did dump over 200m in btc last year to ""prove liquidity"" which promptly crashes the market 50% to where we are. It then recovered to a new all time high of 69k compared to prior height of 60k. It is now, once again, 30k. Within like... A year. He did dump 200m worth or so at the 60k top, it was the top because he dumped."
22-2-1-1,It's not a good sign if one person can tank an asset/coin on their own.
22-2-1-1-1,"I would agree but it's a self fulfilling prophecy and people think they can make more money or gain more BTC if they sell what Elon deems the top... It's gonna feed into itself, I was impressed how fast it recovered"
22-2-1-1-1-1,"That is some impressive growth for sure. And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to single out Bitcoin, we are the same thing happens with the stock market too (and with more nefarious intention as well). In this case, I think the big issue is that a single person owned enough coin to set off a frenzy. If he sold like 1M worth of coin I doubt anyone would have paid attention. That said, folks like to follow a celebrity so maybe it wouldn't have mattered how much he sold."
22-2-1-1-1-1-1,"I don't think it was the volume at which he sold. It was that he was no longer accepting payments in btc because it's bad for the environment. It brought up btc in a bad light and took away legitimacy that a real company in the s&p 500 accepts btc as payment. It's not that he dumped THAT much, it was just the news that Tesla, a huge company for better or worse, changed their mind on btc because of environmental concerns. Aka nothing new so it baffles me he ran into that problem AFTER buying haha, like it's not mainstream that BTC costs a lot of energy."
22-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,I don't think Elon Musk really thinks things through.
22-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,"Pretty sure the environmental concerns were just an excuse to justify the dump. Musk has made it clear he makes ECs for the money and lack of healthy competition in the market, not for any care about environmental impact."
22-2-1-1-1-1-1-3,"There are real companies not on the s&p500 accepting btc everyday…. The stock market does not make something real, and is not the economy. This is an Elon pump and dump special. The market reacted to his loud mouth opinion"
22-2-1-1-2,"He can do that with any asset, is it not obvious to people why billionaires are so terrible to have around?"
22-2-1-1-2-3,"Oh it's fucking terrible for sure. I'd love a maximum income and or very large wealth tax plus a whole host of pro labor laws/protections and a healthy dose of anti trust action to break up monopolies. And in the case of Tesla, a requirement for a standard charging connection and a push to really beef up infrastructure so that it could realistically replace gas stations in the next decade. Whatever we do, no one should be allowed to have that much money/power."
22-2-1-1-2-3-1,"Tesla, Apple, etc. likely wouldn't exist if we had a maximum income and/or a very large wealth tax.  (Far less incentive to create highly-successful companies.)  And society would be far less prosperous overall as a result.    There are already a whole host of pro-labor laws and protections, and a healthy dose of antitrust action to break up monopolies.  Microsoft got broken up 20 years ago when it appeared a threat.   ATT was broken up in the 80's.  Etc.    Joe Biden and our government already have ""that much"" money/power (and far more).  It would be far worse if we had no individuals, companies, or private groups that could challenge that power in any way whatsoever."
22-2-1-1-4,(crypto isn't a good sign)
22-2-1-1-5,The stock market can tank based on one investment firm.
22-2-2,"Actually he dumped lots of TSLA to finance his Twitter buyout. That caused TSLA price to collapse and because he can't help it - caused TWTR to collapse. His other pump and dump schemes - Dogecoin and his own TSLA stock - which he said he was going to buy out for $420 which was illegal and then said the value was too high - which caused a crash - also illegal... If there was a functioning SEC, he would have been arrested several times already for insider trading and stock manipulation."
22-2-3,Elon musk is the the whiskey dick of humans.
22-2-4,Some say he's still pumping to this day...
22-2-5,"Yeah, he pledged to sell no more after selling about $200 million until Bitcoin improved environmentally"
22-2-5-1,Dogecoin?!?! never heard of it
22-3,So does he still have money to buy Twitter?
22-3-1,He isn’t buying it with his money he is getting investors to get the money together.
22-3-1-1,When does it stop being a MLM scheme and starts being a financial cult?
22-3-1-1-1,These two pictures are of the same thing…
22-3-1-1-1-1,"""sOmE oF tHeM aRe BuT [Fill in the blank MLM company] Isn't LiKe tHeM""  - every asshole on facebook"
22-3-1-1-2,10 years ago maybe?
22-3-1-1-3,It's already a cult. A cult I'm apparently part of but enjoyed before Elon went on Twitter
22-3-1-1-4,Bad take
22-3-1-1-4-1,"Your whole comment history is a bad take bro, what's wrong with you?"
22-3-1-1-4-1-1,Parents had a bad take :-/
22-3-1-1-4-1-1-1,Bad at taking it out.
22-3-1-1-4-1-3,What a bad take
22-3-1-2,It's called a loan.  He leveraged Tesla's valuation to float the financials.
22-3-1-2-1,No he is getting investors and you can find what I said on a bunch of news outlets and even on his twitter account. You are talking about what he did to get his PART of the total.
22-3-1-3,He is also securing a loan with Tesla stock.
22-3-1-3-1,You are right. He is getting investors for the bulk on the money and getting loans so he has controlling interest
22-3-1-3-1-1,"Honestly,  that would be stupid for investors, as it's just a toy for Elon and cause it to self-destruct."
22-3-1-3-1-1-1,"they’re in between a rock and a hard place. Elon is probably responsible for a ton of their wealth on paper, so they’re beholden to him in a way. And if having lots of money is your whole shtick in life then you definitely want to stay on the richest person in the world’s good side."
22-3-1-3-2,"Recently, he was looking into reducing the amount of money he would have to pay through financing Tesla stock by finding investors who were willing to finance him against ""preferred equity"" in Twitter instead. From what I understand, this is basically like using a portion of Twitter itself, once he owns it, as collateral for a loan."
22-3-1-4,"That's not true. Investors would be risking their own money directly in Twitter ownership. He is BORROWING most of the money using his tesla shares as collatoral, and ponying up a billion or two of his own cash to make up the difference.He is 100% buying it with his own money, that he has borrowed from finance companies. It's the same as you buying a car by borrowing money. The banks aren't investing in your new car, they are investing in your ability to repay the loan."
22-3-1-4-1,"except it’s been confirmed he’s also got around 20 uber wealthy investors to pony up for a little less than half of the purchase, right?"
22-3-1-4-1-1,"From what I understand, it was originally $21 billion in up-front cash, $12.5 billion from a loan against his Tesla stock, and $12 billion from a loan from Morgan Stanley. And now he's trying to reduce or eliminate the $12.5 billion Tesla loan portion by getting wealthy investors to buy preferred equity in Twitter instead."
22-3-1-4-2,"Plurality, $20B of a $44B deal is loan money. You’re not wrong, just not technically correct. I’m a pedantic ass. Sue me."
22-3-3,No. He won't be buying it. He doesn't have enough money. This was another pump and dump.
22-3-3-1,"It wasn't a pump, it was an excuse for him to dump $10 billion in Tesla shares while it remains at its ludicrously overvalued price."
22-3-3-1-2,What does he do with the money in that case? Shove it into spacex? Mind control monkeys?
22-3-3-1-2-1,"The real thing that hedge funds do is take enormous amounts of money from billionaires and invest in crazy non- correlated (or negatively correlated) things, to ensure the money grows no matter what the rest of the market does. That's the hedging.So I'm not trying to impose a value judgement on this answer, the thing he'll do is put it in a hedge fund."
22-3-3-1-4,Would he not have been able to do this without offering to buy Twitter though?
22-3-3-1-4-1,Any insider in a company has to file with the SEC and give sufficient forewarning before a sale.  Filing to sell off a ton of stock is a massive red flag and would likely burst the Tesla bubble.  This gives him an excuse to do it without the red flags being as obvious.
22-3-3-1-4-2,"If he sells a large amount of Tesla stock for a publicly understandable reason - like ""I need the money to buy Twitter"" - then it won't cause people to lose faith in Tesla's stock price. But if he sells for no apparent reason, it will make people think ""Oh, Musk is selling because he thinks this is as high as TSLA will go. That probably means I should sell off my shares too!"", which could cause a significant downward spiral. (Because TSLA is incredibly overvalued compared to its fundamentals.)"
22-3-3-2,>This was another pump and dumpDo y'all even know what this means anymore?  Feels like you just use it as a buzzword more than anything.  Explain how this was a pump and dump.  It genuinely makes no sense.
22-3-3-2-1,"Because elon owns 9-10%. By saying he is going to buy them it could influence the price action. He could then sell it. As in pump and dump. He has literally done this countless times. Another way to do this is by wording it by saying he has to sell tesla stock to purchase Twitter. So this in turn doesn't fuck up tesla stock price because people don't see it as him running for the hills, but rather a sell to fund something else. So when we say pump and dump it may not even refer to the actual company Twitter but the other shit the grifter is involved with in this case tesla too. So get a clue my bro and quit your elon simping."
22-3-3-2-1-2,He can't just sell it you idiot. God you're braindead on how the laws are setup.
22-3-3-2-1-2-1,Or pay a fine for not disclosing. Which has happened countless times. Laws and regulations are for the poors. This shit is just a tax
22-3-3-2-1-2-1-1,"What did he not disclose? If you're talking about crypto, that isn't regulated and is a free for all."
22-3-5,"Since theres no ""wash rule"" on Crypto he just got a tax credit for +1 billion dollars loss harvested"
22-3-5-1,But the most you can tax loss harvest is 3k?
22-3-5-1-1,"The $3K is applied to ordinary income. The entire loss can offset future capital gains, + an extra $3K against earned income"
22-3-5-1-1-1,Now this makes more sense
22-3-5-1-1-2,"I don’t believe the entire loss can be applied to future capital gains. I think that offset is limited to the current year, and you can carry forward the $3k at a time into future years."
22-3-5-1-1-2-1,"Nah, he can use however much he has. If he has a $1B loss this year, and a $300M gain next year, he can use $300M of his loss next year + $3K against any earned income. If he has $400M of gains the following year, he can use $400M of his losses + another $3K. Capital losses are fully deductible against capital gains with no yearly limits"
22-3-5-1-1-2-1-1,"“The amount of loss that was not deducted in the previous year, over the limit, can be applied against the following year's capital gains and taxable income.”Well I learned something new today."
22-3-5-1-2,He can roll it over to the next year too
22-3-5-1-2-1,Okay…he’s gonna roll 3k tax loss harvest for the next 30k+ years?
22-3-5-1-2-1-1,"Not really how it works. Seems like the whole capital gains tax system clicked with ya in the thread above but,  essentially, the entire economy post-Reagan has always ensured there's some completely legal funny business you're only technically allowed to get up to as long as you have the capital."
22-3-5-1-2-1-2,"Your not listening he can offset capital gains from his losses in bitcoins from other sales of capital gains. So let’s say you report selling bitcoin at a $30,000 loss and you sell a piece of real estate like a restaurant to a developer that really wanted that restaurant and you make a $100,000 capital gain from the sale. You taxes show a $70000 gain because the bitcoin loss is figured in. For things in the commercial world the earned income isn’t always the most important thing."
22-4,"Musk is a snake oil salesman who has been selling illusions to investors to inflate his wealth, so some market correction to the valuation of his companies is absolutely welcome. You can't sell hopes and dreams forever"
22-4-1,Idk Oprah seems to have gotten away with it

22-4-1-3-1-1-1,"**A timeshare (sometimes called vacation ownership) is a property with a divided form of ownership or use rights.

22-4-2,Kind of like how his boring company promised everything and ended up inventing... Tunnels. But even worse than regular tunnels. Like a shitty tunnel.

22-4-2-2,Excuse me sir those tunnels are the finest and most efficient underground deathtrap devised by the human mind.
22-4-2-3,"Yeah, I never understood the hype. They said they're gonna build tunnels and everyone gets all hyped up about tunnels. Mkay."
22-4-2-3-1,Because they were going to make it cheaper but the machines cost like 2 billion or something crazy idk I’m dumb and smell like cabbage.
22-4-2-3-1-1,And the tunnels are tiny deathtraps
22-4-2-3-1-1-1,That was the most concerning thing to me. They built these tiny tunnels with the goal of filling them with electric cars. No contingency plan was made for what is one of the cars catches fire down there.
22-4-2-3-1-1-1-1,"The contingency is that you leave through whatever end of the tunnel isn't past a burning car for you, like how it works for literally every subway on Earth."
22-4-2-3-1-2,The machine would cost more than that.  If they tried building it they would waste $2 billion and learn that it only exists on paper.
22-4-2-3-2,"There was hype because SpaceX has accomplished it’s intended purpose, and has driven the cost to LEO down considerably. Landing a rocket was a news event, then sending a used one back up was a news event. Now the only news event is that Space X is launching more flights in 2022 than the entire globe launched in 2001. Tesla seemed impressive, but the fact that FSD is always 18 months away since 2017 has soured public opinion. Plus Musk has increasingly moved from hyping his products to hyping memes. FSD is cool. Shilling dogecoin is cringe."
22-4-2-3-2-1,">  and has driven the cost to LEO down considerably.I don't actually believe that's true. That is their goal, but the cost of maintenance after each launch has gotten in the way.Space-x achievement is the self landing rocket; but that has not yet led to cheaper launches."

22-4-5-1,"I think those two pulled through. But as someone who came here from r/popular…What else has he done that’s been a net benefit? I’m willing to learn, but for how often I see his name I don’t see many contributions to society. I see stock manipulation. Lies. Arrogance. And just general douchebaggery."
22-4-5-1-1,"He acts like a total douchebag for sure. I don’t think there’s any disputing that. Minimizing his contributions to making EV’s, recyclable rockets and satellite internet just shows your bias, IMO. He didn’t invent any of those things, but he played a big part in the success they’re experiencing. He can be a fucktard *and* also deserve credit for his accomplishments."
22-4-5-1-1-1,"Right, but why are we giving *him* credit and not the teams that made it happen?"
22-4-5-1-1-1-1,"He deserves credit for his leadership and vision to get these things done.  When Tesla started making fast, fun EVs, he was the one that pushed them in that direction. It didn’t just happen spontaneously. Tesla wasn’t worth shit when he bought it, and his ideas and vision are a big part of why it’s successful. The people who did the work deserve a ton of credit as well, obviously. But, I think some people let their personal animus for the guy affect how they perceive the accomplishments.edit: typos"

22-4-5-2,And low latency space-internet that's already allowing a war-torn country to maintain communications while their country is bombed to shit by an invading nation.All fucking snake oil.
22-4-5-2-1,"There's a very good reason why the existing satellite companies do not do what musk is doing. Low latency internet is not that useful except in stuff like online gaming; and most people who need satellite internet aren't online gamers. The markets just don't really overlap. Furthermore, you need to absolutely clusterfuck the earth with satellites to get that low latency. He is planning to increase the number of all satellites already in orbit by like a factor of 40. Meanwhile, other sat-net services use like 3 total satellites; which they can do because they place them at much higher orbits, which result in much greater coverage per satellite. Musk has to use about 50 thousand satellites to do what other companies do with three. The trade off being higher pings. That's a huge amount of clutter for a service that is arguably not needed."
22-4-5-2-1-1,"I don’t think as much ‘low latency internet’, as much as internet at all in rural (and developing) areas. In places that don’t have any cell towers nearby and where it isn’t possible/financially viable to erect them, a small 600$ antenna, that in addition provides low-latency-high-speed internet, is perfect."

23-3-1-1,"Mmmmmm, naan... **Homer Simpson drool sound effect**"
23-3-2,"With how Terra is going, it might just hit 1mill by the end of the week.Edit: Terra not tether"
23-3-2-3,Tether? Are you following the wrong stablecoin lol?
23-3-2-3-1,he's from the future and just broke rule nr.1
23-3-2-3-2,Yeah I am shorting the wrong stablecoin 
23-3-2-3-2-1,UST isn't down yet
23-3-2-3-2-1-1,UST is down 40%. It's not offline but man it is down and unlikely to ever recover the confidence it once had. I expected usdT to depeg and shorted that one. usdT is much more stable than Kwan.
23-3-2-5,Yeah but have you seen how well LUNA is doing?
23-4,If only I hadn’t sold my kidneys in 2018!

23-5,"Say what you want, but this is actually one of the funnier posts I’ve seen."
23-5-1,For just a millisecond was like what's going on here lol
23-5-3,99/100 comedy posts on this subreddit are terrible...1/100 comedy posts are pure ~~gold~~ Bitcoin
23-5-3-1,I prefer calling my gold physical Bitcoin.Edit: spelling
23-5-3-1-1,*physical
23-5-5,I want to say that this one of GME funnier posts I’ve seen
24,Anon buys bitcoin.
24-1,"""*just* a x2 return"""
24-1-2,Deserves to be scammed of his own money
24-1-3, most pathetic part
24-1-4,To be fair even a 1.1x return would be nice
24-1-4-1,"If you can get a consistent 1.1x annual return, year over year, you would be the greatest investor of all time.The fees for coinbase also fuck you. As you can see in the screenshot, he’s paying about 4-5% in fees. And he’ll pay that again when he sells. So even a 1.1x return (an amazing return for almost any investment) would cause him to just break even."
24-1-4-1-1,Jesus christ 5% fees. Coinbase really is a big noobtrap
24-1-4-1-1-1,The real money in crypto is to be made from scamming clueless memefallers with the fees. Everything else is too volatile to touch.
24-1-4-1-1-1-1,Just like how the best way to make money during a gold rush is to sell shovels.
24-1-4-1-1-1-1-1,"Then go collect shovels from all the corpses in the hills and sell 'em again.Washington state and California were both built from beautiful, perfect capitalism like this. Probably lots of other places too."
24-1-4-1-1-1-2,Bigger idiots all the way down.
24-1-4-1-1-1-3,"OP should have just paid someone on Fiverr to develop a brokerage app and then market it for the 30k+ he wasted, charge 4% instead of 5% like Coinbase, and he'd be in the green in a month with room to grow. I suppose he'd have to keep a good chunk of cash on the side to play bank for his first transactions, but you get the gist."
24-1-4-1-1-2,Coinbase pro is free to use and has less than 1% fees but people think it’s ugly or don’t know about it so they end up paying insane fees on the regular coinbase app
24-1-4-1-1-4,Because he paid with a debit card. If he had called his bank and asked them to send a wire instead of removing his debit limit he would have saved $1000
24-1-4-1-2,You’d be Brenie Madoff
24-1-4-1-2-1,"Like I said, the greatest investor of all time."
24-1-4-1-3,"Exactly, he can *hope* at best for 1.1x lol"
24-1-4-1-4,"No you wouldn't, that's a 10% return and would not make you the greatest investor of all time. The s&p500 already returns like 9.5% per year.Warren buffett has averaged 20% annual returns over the last few decades, and since returns act mathematically like compound interest, that is exponentially higher than 10%. He is considered one of the greatest investors. 10% is not, it's just a decent return."
24-1-4-1-4-1,"Notice how I said “consistent” and not “average annual return”. Huge difference between the two. Warren buffet has an average annual return of just under 10% over the past 30 years. He’s had years where he’s returned above 20%, and years where he’s lost between 10 to 30%. So no, he hasn’t averaged a 20% return over the past several decades. If he had, his companies would be worth more than the entire US GDP."
24-1-4-1-4-1-1,I can get a consistent 20% return... just in the negatives
24-1-4-1-4-1-1-1,No you cant unless youre intentionally throwing money away. If you diversify your portfolio and get a consistent annual loss of 20% you could just as easily turn it around because youre already predicting the market extremely well
24-1-4-1-5,"No, 1.1x is just a 10% return. The S&P has compounded more than that on average (10.6%) over the last 40 years."
24-1-4-1-5-1,"Notice how I said consistent, not average. The average is around 10%, but there’s also lots of years with negative returns like 2022 ytd. If a basketball player gets 70 points, 10 points, and 10 points in 3 games, they’re getting an average of 30 points, but they aren’t consistently getting 10 points."
24-1-4-2,If that’s what you want buy TIPS treasury bond. Pays out 9+% a year.
24-1-4-2-1,Series I savings bond*Interest rate changes twice a year in May and Sept and has historically been much lower than 9%*But yeah not a bad choice. The website and process is a huge pain in the ass though
24-1-4-2-1-1,"Not a bad choice considering that the interest is compounded semi-annually, and a $10k I bond purchased 20 years ago would now be worth about $40,000.Not bad for the safest bet in the market."
24-1-4-3,"That the point, anon is a mouth breather for going in expecting 2x roi"
24-1-5,That dumbass really thought he was going to double or triple his money in maybe a day or a week...
24-2,"""I'd be happy with just a 2x return""are they really this dumb"
24-2-1,Imagine thinking buy the dip means you’ll double your money overnight 
24-2-1-1,Actually I did this a few times back in 2020 and more than doubled my investment. It was completely gambled and it was only couple hundred bucks but it's not impossible.
24-2-1-1-1,"It's not impossible, but it's highly unlikely at this point. And no one should ever expect to make 200%+ return."
24-2-1-1-2,You need to underatand that is fundamentally easier when moving small volumes
24-2-2,"A good friend of mine took his 401k and put it in AMC, which is down like 85% from its peak. So to your question, yeah people are this fucking stupid. Makes me sad."
24-2-2-1,"Wow. Maybe he can use the receipt to qualify for disability, then."
24-2-2-2,"Is he still parroting the r-slurred lines about ""MOASS any day now!"" or has he accepted that he got hosed and will have to start over?"
24-2-2-2-1,"I think he’s accepted he got hosed. I’m like dude, *index funds.* this is retirement we’re taking about."
24-2-2-3,"Taking that money and putting it into a house is a much smarter investment. Everyone's been saying the bubble will pop for years, but it just isn't."
24-2-3,"People were buying links to monkey pictures for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The idiots who bought into NFTs and are continuously pumping money into crypto really are that dumb, and dumber. They actually think they can just push buy on the app, and then in like a day, maybe a week if it's a slow one. They're delusional."
24-2-4,Just means more money for the rest of us. Or something like that.
24-2-5,"They are buying bitcoin in 2022, so... yes?"
24-3,Well at least his cardboard sign when he's begging will be new: Took Financial Advice from 4chan. Please help.
24-3-1,Assuming hell be able to afford the cardboard
24-3-1-1,That shits free dawg
24-3-1-1-1,We're talking about a guy who buys the bubble while it's bursting. He's gonna go and try to buy some.
24-3-2,Believing this is real lmao do plebbitors really?
24-4,"The old adage rings true:If you can't afford to lose it, you can't afford to gamble it"
24-4-1,exactly know your limits dont become a fucking homeless
24-4-1-1,Still less worst than be a tenant today 
24-4-1-1-1,Yeah keep telling yourself that as you sit in your smelly tent buddy
24-4-1-1-1-1,Joke on you a tent is Luxury for me Dis you ever sleep in a dirt Hole !
24-4-1-1-1-1-1,We were evicted from our hole in the ground. We had to go and live in a lake.
24-4-1-1-1-1-1-3,You were lucky. We used to live in a shoe box in the middle of the road and every morning had to lick the road clean with our tongues
24-4-2,Seriously. I put about 2k in crypto because that was my personal limit. I was not willing to lose anymore than that. You invest what you’re willing to lose. OP did not.
24-4-2-1,"60 ish for me. Not 60k, 60 dollars. Got some Shibainu and I'm down to like 20 bucks in value. Feel bad for folks who really invested."
24-4-2-1-1,"And that’s totally cool. Everyone has that magic number. If you know it’ll bug you if you lose it, don’t do it.Everyone’s so attracted to get rich quick schemes and they lose all their money. It’s one thing if you’re single but if you make your family endure that kinda hardship, it’s not short of pure degeneracy."
24-4-2-1-1-1,"I'm kinda glad I did what I did. It sated the urge to get into crypto. And I'm not out a lot. Adding on to that, if it skyrocketed in value, I would have kicked myself for not investing more when I did. Honestly losing most of my meager investment is a good thing."
24-4-2-1-1-1-1,"Better to invest in Roth IRA, mutual funds, etc.. especially now with the market tanking, it’s a great opportunity to get in while the gettings good."
24-4-2-1-1-2,"> Everyone’s so attracted to get rich quick schemes and they lose all their moneyjust invest in/create something that people will think is an excellent substitute for losing weight or working out. People will go to extraordinary lengths to not have to exercise, the lady that made the shake weight is living proof of this"
24-4-2-1-2,See I bought a whole bitcoin for 120$ back in 2013 to buy some acid. Then I chickened out and let it sit for a few months.Sold at 250$.
24-4-2-1-2-3,Hope you found some acid.
24-4-2-1-3,"I once put £20 in alchemy pay when it had that big rally last year. Walked away with £80 and was chuffed.Only dabbled a tenner here and there since then, and usually lost around half of it before noping out and cutting my losses"
24-4-2-2,"I put $40, dad put $60. We're all down because of the crash, but it's so little money that we can just keep it there and be happy if it goes up, or just sell it and shrug it off.Moral is, don't be an idiot"
24-4-2-3,"Importantly, you need to be able to spend it without it affecting your cash flow.I keep $12k on hand in cash for emergencies. A couple grand usually in the checking account as a buffer."
24-5,"Is this bait?>be happy with at least 2x returnHumble, aren’t we?"
24-5-1,"""be happy with at least 2x return"" was the confirmation it is indeed bait."
24-5-2,Yes please 4Chan just a 100% ROI on my crypto investment. Least stupid bitcoin buyer
24-5-3,On Coinbase too which is on the verge of bankruptcy. Huge bait
25,May 22 Bitcoin pizza day .
25-1,"""Daddy can we eat the pizza now?""""No, we gotta HODL it"""
25-1-1,"OR he is truly our hero because this was among the first real usecases. Who knows, maybe if he skips this transaction BTC wouldn't be here as we know it."
25-1-1-1,Yeah. I always see this guy catching a hard time on the internet. I generally feel like it's usually all in good fun. I think he is awesome! I'm almost certain it wasn't his only 10k Bitcoins!
25-1-1-1-1,"If he and everyone else who spent lots of coins for basic things in the early  days decided not to do that and hodl instead, it wouldn't have taken off how it did. It pains us all to think of what we bought when coins were cheap, but you can't dwell on it.  Every one of those early purchases demonstrated utility which was necessary for Bitcoin to become what it has.Or at least that's what I tell myself when I look back on my Silk Road shenanigans "
25-1-1-1-1-1,I will remember buying my first Bitcoin for about $100. Sometimes I cry in the dark thinking about what I could be worth of I had HODLd back then like I do now
25-1-1-1-1-1-1,"I mean 1 bitcoin isnt life changing money (for most) so nothing to be too upset about. Now if you had 10+ or 100+ bitcoin, then yeah thats a ouch."
25-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"True, though I did have several at one point, around the time 1BTC=$200-300.But then life happened and I had to cash the majority out for fiat.It's one of those things, you know it was the right decision at the time but that doesn't make it hurt any less viewed through a $40k Bitcoin lens.I'm still a believer and a hodler though!"
25-1-1-1-1-1-1-2,That is indeed a needle pinching point though and somewhat gives pain to that specific part of your body.
25-1-1-1-1-1-1-4,"I know it’s hard for “us” to remember sometimes, but 25-40k is ABSOLUTELY life changing money to many many ppl.Ask the millions of ppl who struggle from paycheck to paycheck and they will tell u: $29k would change nearly every aspect of their lives. They will go from a bus to a used car, an apartment to a home ownership (a 10k down payment would put many renters into an FHA loan) and probably most importantly, they would have a savings account instead of a prepaid card that their paycheck gets dropped into.So ya, sorry to tell u: one coin would cause many millions of ppl to literally have tears of joy and fall to their knees in pure bliss!"
25-1-1-1-1-1-2,This was my friend last year when he used bitcoin on his hold app to pay for perishable items on shopify. I reminded him recently and he consoles himself with how BTC has dipped even lower now lol.
25-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,Lmao somewhat did a great job though like help and make him understand what holding actually feels like.
25-1-1-1-1-2,hahaha nice
25-1-1-1-1-3,I was going to put $50 into BTC back in 2010 but then I decided to buy 40oz beers for my roommates and I and we duct taped them to our hands and drank all night.  I don’t think I regret it…  oky a little bit
25-1-1-1-1-5,"Yeah... Sometimes if I want to make myself feel bad, I rough out the current value of those old transactions"
25-1-1-1-2,You got to imagine if he was that comfortable using it and buying it 12 years ago he must of been early to the bitcoin rush of recent years so even if he didn’t have any he must of jumped on the bandwagon early as can be to make some money of if
25-1-1-1-3,"Yeah if had 10k he probably had way more. And seeing they weren't worth much back then, getting 10k more probably wasn't hard."
25-1-1-1-4,"My favorite investing mantra is “No one ever lost money taking a profit”… not sure his means of acquiring the 10k BTC, but it’s plausible it cost him less than 2 pizzas."
25-1-1-1-4-1,"Yeah. That's generally actually how I take profits now days. I usually have something that I want to buy, almost always lol. I'll pull some crypto to buy whatever it is I want. Just my way of taking profit. When the price pulls back I'll restart my accumulation regiment. I'm sure he didn't even pay for those 10,000 BTC. Probably mined them on a laptop! FML! I missed out on that one! Lol. Could've had all of my servers mining BTC back then!"
25-1-1-1-5,he didn't knew what the worth would be in the coming years not his fault though!
25-1-1-2,"This transaction was literally how Bitcoin found it’s starting price. 2 avg. pizzas divided by 10,000 = starting price"
25-1-1-2-1,united states aproves this measurement scale
25-1-1-2-1-1,How does this convert in the EU?
25-1-1-2-1-1-1,"2 average pizzas / 10000,Let's say in Italy that would be 13€/10000 so 1 btc would be worth 0.0013 €"
25-1-1-2-1-1-1-2,"It's a great birth, and it's a testament to the value of bitcoin being able to be used to buy physical objects, which is why it exists"
25-1-1-2-2,"Yep, without this transaction we would never know BTC on what is it today."
25-1-1-3,Bitcoin butterfly effect!
25-1-1-3-1,Look at the guy wearing the green Tee I see why the guy used 10k Bitcoins to get the pizza.
25-1-1-4,"he could just as easily buy 10k btc again after they finished eating the pizza, so don't feel he gave up that much"
25-1-1-4-1,Trading fiat for btc in 2010 wasn’t nearly as easy as it is nowadays
25-1-1-4-1-1,"You could easily buy bitcoin using PayPal on an exchange called New Liberty Standard in 2009. When New Liberty Standard opened, the exchange rate was over 1,300 BTC for a dollar."
25-1-1-4-1-1-1,If I ever get to go back in time or start a new game+ in life I’m going to throw every penny at Bitcoin.
25-1-1-4-1-1-1-1,You can still throw every penny at bitcoin.Though you probably want to keep a short term savings in fiat currency for the times when the bitcoin price drops.
25-1-1-4-1-1-1-2,"Really? If you could save information and go back in time, wouldn’t you just write down a handful of winning lottery numbers and dates? Seems a lot more effective"
25-1-1-4-1-1-1-3,Pretty high time it feels now too to just keep holding onto the coins and make some good gains!
25-1-1-4-1-1-2,But back then people lacked the though of holding and to which they regret now.
25-1-1-4-1-2,This guy was the first BTC miner to use a GPU... he didn't need to buy it.
25-1-1-4-1-2-1,Anyone know where he's at today?
25-1-1-4-1-2-2,Are you just sure about it then indeed actually where is the guy after all?
25-1-1-4-1-3,"indeed, you could literally just mine the thing"
25-1-1-4-1-5,Even in 2014 it was a hassle. You had to wire people money or find someone in your area you could trade with.
25-1-1-4-2,"He did it 6 more times. Spent about 70,000 BTC on pizzas. He was mining most of the coins as he was the first GPU miner."
25-1-1-4-4,"Yes, maybe he had 50,000 of them"
25-1-1-4-5,"That thought that didn't hit his mind well enough that much though, lmao!"
25-1-1-5,"Yeah, it's possible that it would have never taken off. Or maybe someone else would've done something similar but a lot later and we would still be in sub thousand per BTC right now."
25-1-1-5-1,There were crypto currency attempts before Bitcoin that never took.
25-1-1-5-1-2,And the time when Bitcoin actually took all over and is all set at this position though.
25-1-1-5-2,As per todays value that would could litreally reached to all on a high level though.

25-1-2-1-1,Bullish

25-1-5-1-1,Seems like you not the only one who ruined the one who didn't hodl are ruined too
25-1-5-2,Hunger makes everything come out and makes people mind puzzled and confused enough.
25-2,"This provided a use case that started the trickle which became a flood of further use cases bringing us to where we are today.Without use cases of actually exchanging Bitcoin for services rendered, at any amount of bitcoin, we wouldn't be here now to the extent at which we are."
25-2-1,"I like to point out that if we actually think of BTC as a currency, it doesn’t make sense to ridicule this guy for using it as currency or use him as an example of what not to do."
25-2-1-1,"Only idiots ridicule him, and complete morons would go ""lol he could have held and be have billions of dollars"". They don't understand the significance of this act. He forced BTC to the real world."
25-2-1-2,Even more retarded to make fun of it when he himself doesn't regret it and instead is proud of the fact that he was basically the first bitcoin exchange (albeit the only pair traded was BTC-PZZA)!
25-2-1-3,he didn't use it as currency. He ~~traded it~~ technically bought someone elses services. He never bought a pizza with BTC. The pizza was bought with fiat.
25-2-1-3-1,Splitting hairs
25-2-1-3-1-1,"It's really not. If you're not directly paying with it, you never bought anything with it. The person providing the goods/service needs to receive it in X currency to be able to say it was paid for in X currency.    There's no argument that the money the pizzeria received was fiat. Therefore it was not paid for in BTC."
25-2-1-4,Agreed 
25-2-2,It's literally just because people started trading drugs with bitcoin.
25-2-3,Finally I can use a medium of exchange to purchase goods

26-1,"> Then In June, crypto lending firm Celsius paused withdrawals for its customers citing “extreme market conditions.”Celsius is really funny. It will likely become the next big one to declare bankrupcy in one way or another. From their sub: > A new way to earn, borrow, and pay on the blockchain. Earn up to 17% APY on crypto, and get a crypto-backed loan for as low as 1% APRYou don't need to be a financial genius to read that and realize that there is something wrong. If they are lending money at 1% rates and paying 17% APY...where is the money coming from? You could just borrow money from them at 1% and invest it there and somehow get lots of free money (not hard to imagine that this is exactly what many did...). They have more than 1 million of customers. You can find hodlers in their sub who _still_ believe that there is nothing wrong and that withdrawals with resume soon."

26-2-4-1,And take all the shitcoins with it.  This crypto non-sense needs to die.
26-2-4-1-1,Would you like to buy an NFT of your comment?
26-2-4-1-1-1,"After he has bought it, I would like to pay significantly more money to buy it from him because that will make it worth more."
26-2-4-1-1-1-2,Price determines values (some crypto bro literally said that to me once)
26-2-4-1-1-1-2-1,"If you understand value, you wouldn't buy any cryptocurrency in the first place. Ergo if one owns crypto, one doesn't understand value. Thus it doesn't surprise me that a crypto bro said those words. There are far sillier things that I've heard come out of their mouths. For instance, ""crypto is a store of energy because so much energy was used to mine it, and energy is value, therefore it has value"". Then they kinda look at you with a smirk as if to say, ""there, beat that 4d chess move, ya poor loser no-coiner!"", suggesting they're on a higher plane of intelligence or something. It's like talking to a flat earther. Bonkers."
26-3,This is good for bitcoin
26-3-1,"The lower it goes, the more bullish i become - actual quote from a crypto influencer."
26-3-1-1,"Not exactly a fair equivalency, but this thinking has made people a lot of money in the stock market historically."
26-3-1-1-2,And for me personally in crypto. This legit happens every 4 years it’s nothing new
26-3-1-1-2-1,"Yeah people have been saying the same thing every time it crashes and then somehow it comes back stronger every time.I don't like Bitcoin really, but I also really don't think it's that hard to make a profit. Buy a little bit when the suicide hotline is up in r/cryptocurrency every once in awhile, sell in a couple years for a nice little bonus."
26-3-1-1-2-1-1,"Just don't be stupid and invest huge amounts, make sure that it's a sum you wouldn't cry over if it was all gone tomorrow.Investing half a month of salary is probably the most I would recommend for something as risky."
26-3-1-1-3,Same people also list examples of the time they bought cheap garbage and learnt that cheap garbage you dont buy cause its garbage. Even if its cheap
26-3-1-1-3-1,What?
26-3-1-1-3-1-1,The best investors will tell you can't just buy and hold. You need to buy undervalued assets to hold.
26-3-1-1-3-1-1-1,So. Buy low sell high.
26-3-1-1-4,"And conversely, even more people have lost a lot of money in the stock market this way."
26-3-1-1-5,If stocks end up priced below their fundamentals you can buy them at a discount. But crypto doesn't have any fundamentals.
26-3-1-2,I hope it hits 10k so I can buy some!
26-3-1-2-1,Might as well wait for.it to go to 1.
26-3-2,Best possible outcome
26-3-3,time to buy the dip
26-3-3-1,Time to BE the dip
26-3-3-1-2,Soon to be fucking nachos
26-3-3-2,Or catch the falling knife.
26-3-3-3,Bottom isn’t here. Wait until housing collapses.
26-3-4,"Just gotta ride this one out, local minima is all. Those who don't know sell, those who do know, well you know."
26-3-4-1,You are aware local minima means that there's an even lower minimal point?
26-4,It's like a stock that acts like a currency that few businesses accept.
26-4-1,"As a currency- it’s very difficult to divide Bitcoin into small enough pieces, it’s difficult to use it for purchase transactions, as a store of value it fluctuates wildly, and finally very few merchants accept it. Best case scenario, it could be used as an intermediary international currency, but…why? We already have the US dollar. Bitcoin is a (speculative) investment vehicle and nothing more."
26-4-1-1,Or just a straight up scam 
26-4-1-1-1,BTC and ETH are the only coins that are not a scam
26-4-1-1-1-1,"You're hanging on to that thread, huh?  How far underwater are you so far?"
26-4-1-1-1-1-1,Eh I only own .5 BTC and 4 ETH.  It’s much less than 20% of my portfolio.  I just believe the value is there
26-4-1-1-1-1-1-1,">I just believe the value is thereGreat.  Quantify that value.  If you find yourself saying ""I feel"", or ""I believe"", or ""I just know"", then you should be more than a little worried.  I don't know about you, but I prefer 100% my portfolio to be something I can bank on, not just 80%."
26-4-1-1-1-2,Also Bittensor.
26-4-1-1-1-3,"BTC is the biggest of the scams. they often promise investors ""profits to the moon"" its legit no better than tossing money in a piggy bank end of day.and its more secure in a piggy bank... the so called ""decentralized exchanges"" \*aka a bank\* are often being exploited with bank doors. ETH has been hit 4 times since 2019... sure the ledger may be secure but thats akin to hitting an armored truck as its moving cash... no one does that.  all the exploits are in wallets (akin to storing at home) or the exchanges... and without insurance to back up these thefts...."
26-4-1-1-2,When you add the stablecoin to the mix is always has that feel.
26-4-1-2,">As a currency- it’s very difficult to divide Bitcoin into small enough piecesThe fuck? Bitcoin is divided into 0.00000001 BTC (0.019 cents at current valuation) in the main blockchain, and you can divide it further in Lighting."
26-4-1-2-2,It's weird at a fundamental level to pay for things with that many zeros before other numbers appear.It's also super awkward store wise to constantly adjust pricing and better hope you don't miss a zero!
26-4-1-2-2-4,"I don’t think many retailers price things in Bitcoin (or any other crypto) precisely because the units are unfamiliar and the value is more volatile than most country issued currencies. From a customer perspective you can easily toggle between crypto units and local currency in every wallet I’ve used. From a retailer perspective they price their goods in local currency and generate a live conversion to Bitcoin at the point of sale. So no, no-one is trying to figure out how many zeros they need. Maybe you should actually give it a try? Because based on your comment you’re clearly criticising something you aren’t actually familiar with."
26-4-1-2-2-5,"not really ya just usin' nanobtc, bruh"
26-4-1-2-3,"""So, that bottle of milk will be 0.000002 BTC plus 0.00001BTC in transaction fees.  Wait.... Sorry, BTC just crashed.  Now it's 0.00004 BTC.   Hang on....  Just a sec.... Okay, it's 0.0001 BTC if you pay right now."""
26-4-1-2-4,"The far bigger problem with using Bitcoin for general spending use is that its blockchain can do up to 7 transactions per second with a latency of about 10 minutes, and the processing fees are kinda rough in comparison to handing cash or writing a check.  Imagine standing in line at Target waiting for your transaction to make it into the next block, hopefully you've bid a high enough fee to make it happen or you might be waiting for at least another 10 minutes.This is a real-time visualization of the blockchain in action How in the fuck is this supposed to work for general use spending?"
26-4-1-2-4-1,The lightning network allows for high volumes of bitcoin transactions near instantaneously. The fees are also much lower than the normal method of sending bitcoin.
26-4-1-2-4-1-1,"Oh good, another coin.  I'll stick it with all the other coins promising to be the one coin that's gonna totally take over daily retail transactions."
26-4-1-2-4-1-1-1,"This isn't another coin, this is a layer built on the top of bitcoin. It's mesh network pre-existing channels rather than broadcasting transactions. It already works, this is what they are currently using in El Salvador and Central African Republic as it allows for quick and cheap transactions for both every day use and remittances."
26-4-1-2-5,Imagine trying to spend 0.0000002 BTC for a pack of gum. Think about the ledger for that accounting.
26-4-1-4,"Er what makes you say it's ""hard to divide Bitcoin into small enough pieces""What kinda nonsense is that statement?> A satoshi is the smallest denomination of bitcoin, equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin.How much more divisible do you think it should be?"
26-4-1-4-1,"I think it's that the transaction fees are high enough that you'd never use Bitcoin to make a micro-purchase, hence while you *could* divide it down, you have no reason to. Like if I had a wallet with $0.50 worth of BTC I effectively have none because I can't spend it."
26-4-1-4-1-1,"So, look. Sitting in the backseat watching this play out since the white paper was originally released. My impression was Bitcoin would always be more like a tool for large entities to settle their debts, and we would either build ontop of it, or replace it outright. If it ever grew beyond being a production POC (which I still don't think it has)As of today, the Lightning networks were built to settle debts like you've described eg Micro purchases.But again, that has nothing to do with divisibility. And all of that being said, if it actually goes to 0 I'll just be looking for the thing that stole its crown. Crypto and blockchain ledgers are here to stay, the details of their implementation will likely be fluid for a long time."
26-4-1-4-2,List 10 things you can buy with satoshi.
26-4-1-4-2-1,"1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.1. Your mom.Seriously that is the dumbest question I've fielded in the last couple of weeks, and I've had some dumb ones.Quick name something you can buy with a penny."
26-4-1-4-2-1-1,Okay what can you but with satoshi is you had now then one of them. Say 100? 200? 1000?
26-4-1-4-2-1-1-1,Why are you asking such dumb questions?
26-4-3,Except if stocks go bust they have some backing assets that can be sold off
26-5,"It’s almost like it’s a volatile, unregulated marketplace selling non existent property."
27,"‘Stars align’ as bitcoin price hits $42,069 on 4/20!"

28,"Whale No. 3 just moved 15.5k BTC out of storage**BREAKING: The wallet is claimed to be another cold wallet, likely belonging an untagged exchange.** [**"
28-1,I love how this person casually sent $10m worth of BTC as their test transaction before unloading $50m-$100m transfers 
28-1-1,"He: \*Sends 500 BTC\* Okay, we're good to go Me: \*Sends 0.0001BTC\* hmmm no let's double check, can't afford to lose my 0.21 BTC"

28-1-1-1-2,Don't grovel. We're all kings here.
28-1-1-1-2-1,"Yes. This. Got fake it till you make it, my doooods."
28-1-2,Wouldn't it be funny if they're reading this thread laughing at everything we're saying.
28-1-2-1,Or if OP is actually the whale
28-1-2-1-2,I think you're on to something.
28-1-4,Really puts things into perspective
28-1-4-1,"Billionaires live in a different reality from us.  117k BTC (~2.6 billion USD) would be the equivalent of:* 4,349 years of yearly salary at $597,815 ()* 12,248 new lambos (based on )* 3,058,823 median global "
28-1-4-1-2,That’s fucked.
28-1-4-1-2-1,One day he/She Will sell them..and Will be a black swan.
28-1-4-2,Really makes you feel like a shrimp in a sea of whales
28-1-4-3,"But really makes no sense to me. The amount on a test transaction doesn't matter, so they might as well send 0.0001 BTC. But hey, that person probably uses golden leaves as tissues."
28-1-4-3-4,"Who says it's a test transaction. You don't know what it's about. And if it was one why separate the other ones in various other transactions, if it was a test and it went thru then they'd just have sent all next"
28-2,"EDITI did some digging around and the wallet appears to match binance's bitcoin futures open interest. The amount of bitcoin sent to a new address matches the insurance fund of bitcoin & stablecoins. They sent some bitcoin to coinbase every now and then to buy and sell and keep the insurance fund correct dollarwise.I'm still digging, but some things they do seem to look like heavy manipulation to grind liquidation fees to fill their ""insurance"" fund. -----‐-‐-------‐----------------------By the looks of it this is coinbases collateral bitcoin wallet. They received their bitcoin back after paying off the loan and it matches the rise in volume. The reason why it always seem to appear like the wallet buys the dip is because it coincides with people putting their bitcoin up as collateral, causing it to end up in the wallet. Then they proceed to buy bitcoin with their received loan pushing the price up."
28-2-1,I think this may be the logical explanation of what is happening
28-2-2,So you can see the trading flow on one of the biggest crypto exchanges
28-2-4,It's a dick move not to identify themselves if so. All the binance and kraken wallets are known.
28-3,"Whales don't predict bottoms and tops, they create them."
28-3-2,"They also sometimes figuratively beach themselves and create a massive, stinking corpse that no amount of dynamite in Oregon can ever blow up."
28-3-4,"Do they? Why did so many hedge funds with billions upon billions of dollars are going bankrupt? Or Michael saylor the biggest bitcoin whale out there is down on his investments?I feel as though people just like to blame whales if their investments don't go there way. MS does not play with leverage nor does elsavador. The market is more unpredictable than people give it credit for. No single entity can control it. Whales can capitalize on news but without support, it wont last. Not to mention whales does not exist as a single force. They fight. Some are bullish some are bearish."
28-3-4-1,because they were playing with leverage (=not directly affecting market price) and buying dickbutts for dozens of millions of dollars
28-3-4-1-2,How does using leverage not directly affect the market price? Do crypto platforms work like stock brokers?
28-3-4-1-2-1,"I think they’re alluding to derivatives rather than underlying. I can buy calls on MSTR and benefit from BTC rising but not actually add to the long side of the trade, for example. Cash settled futures are doing the same"
28-3-4-1-2-1-1,"Ahhh that makes more sense. HOLD TF UP, we have derivatives in crypto now?!?!"
28-3-4-1-2-1-1-1,"Derivatives have existed..since the first big pump. In fact, the existence of shorting ( not perpetual swap, but the ones that expire) has been alleged to be the cause of the first massive dump , for indirect reasons of speculator whales causing the dump at a loss to earn 10-100x by leverage"

28-4-1-1,"One of them is BlockOne. They ran a $4 billion ICO to make EOS, sold all of the ETH for BTC.

29,Binance pauses bitcoin withdrawals due to a ‘stuck transition’ as crypto sell-off deepens
29-1,"Latest update:#Bitcoin network withdrawals have now resumed on #Binance.> A batch of $BTC transactions got stuck due to low TX fees, resulting in a backlog of BTC network withdrawals. > As a result, withdrawals on the Bitcoin network are temporarily suspended on Binance. > BTC withdrawals on other networks (BEP20 & ERC20) remain open as normal."
29-1-2,"Does ""replace by fee"" (pretty old btc improvement) cost anything to support?  The only thing that explains withdrawal suspension is that this was/is a transfer from cold to hot wallet.  I was under the impression that before replace by fee, it was possible to just respend the transaction output with a dependency."
29-1-4,Even if that's true it means that Binance fucked uo there.
29-1-5, > BTC withdrawals on other networks (BEP20 & ERC20)...What does that even mean?
29-2,What does stuck transaction mean? How can this happen?
29-2-1,"The Bitcoin Mempool is currently sitting around 40m bytes, which is the highest it's been for the past several months.Here's what I suspect happened:A Binance employee must've moved a large amount of funds from one of their cold wallets to another hot wallet to pay their customers for withdrawals. But they set the transaction fee really low because they didn't anticipate a sudden rise in network activity today, so now it's just stuck in the mempool, and they don't have enough funds in their hot wallets.Edit: Confirmed on their Twitter that transactions were stuck due to low transaction fees. Rookie mistake. Don't be cheap on large important transactions."
29-2-1-1,Can't you replace by fee?
29-2-1-1-1,"Yes.But probably no one has direct access to the wallet keys so no employee could walk away with the money, and maybe whichever system they use to manage the wallets probably doesn't support it"
29-2-1-1-1-1,"Seems plausible and that’s enough, I guess?"
29-2-1-1-1-1-1,"It's not remotely plausible. In 5 years of being in business no one ever thought whether they might need to increase a transaction fee during periods of high blockspace demand?Do people really believe they're sending their available BTC (which is billions), but somehow trying to get away with paying almost no fee?"
29-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,This makes as much sense as people receiving made-up “currency” for solving useless math problems. When I was in kindergarten I use to get a gold star for doing the same thing. Why not send potatoes or rocks for doing the same thing? At least they have some utility and unlike Bitcoin or Dogecoin or whatever made up fake currency they make up next they can’t be used for a “pump and dump” scheme to hoodwink the young and stupid.
29-2-1-1-1-1-1-3,">  In 5 years of being in business no one ever thought whether they might need to increase a transaction fee during periods of high blockspace demand?Despite Binance's success, it sounds like a shoddy and shady operation so I can totally imagine them not willing to spend time and money on something that doesn't immediately benefit them."
29-2-1-1-1-1-1-4,...I thought that was the whole point of the holy crypto??  I can't remember the last time I paid *any* fee to move my USD. Lol this clownshow meltdown is awesome to watch.
29-2-1-1-1-3,"you'd think that a company as large, and as long in this space, as Binance would ~~be~~ have several employees savvy enough to write some little utility to construct & sign RBF transactions --- *and would've done it by now*."
29-2-1-1-1-3-2,no one would do this with that kind of money on the line.
29-2-1-1-1-3-2-1,"you're probably right, but I'd have expected the same thing re: lowballing fees.(and RBF has been around for *years* so it's not like it's some wild new thing...)"
29-2-1-1-1-4,So much better than regular fiat banking wow im in awe
29-2-1-1-2,"That's a very good point. I'm not too familiar with RBF in practice, but it seems like they could solve this pretty easily with that."
29-2-1-1-2-1,My ex-wife has really bad RBF.
29-2-1-1-2-1-1,I feel like there is a joke here that went over my head.
29-2-1-1-2-2,"RBF only works if the original transaction has some specific bits set. Child Pays for Parent (spending the stuck output in a separate transaction, paying enough fee to cover both transactions) should work with any wallet though."
29-2-1-2,">Don't be cheap on large important transactions.The fact that binance of all ' people' got caught out by this is actually pretty interesting, I never thought they would be so cheap to risk this happening"
29-2-1-2-2,"They're not, its a blatant lie because they wanted to/had to halt withdrawals because of panic selling."
29-2-1-2-2-1,"why would they halt withdrawals due to panic selling?they get commissions, they get the withdrawal fee, they literally profit from panic sells"
29-2-1-2-2-1-1,It's also in their best interest that faith in crypto stays strong by doing whatever they can to limit the price drops
29-2-2,It’s code for “fuck the price is crashing we need to offload our crypto before the regular people so the price stays higher for a bit longer to allow our rich investors and board members time to sell first”
29-2-2-2,"Exactly. The Rich getting richer, eating us poor ones up along the way"
29-2-2-3,"I disagree.To sell BTC on Binance you need to deposit, not to withdraw.If you want to buy BTC on Binance you can still can do it (but will get it on your wallet later)."
29-2-2-4,How does stuck withdrawals keep the price higher?
29-2-2-4-1,"It's not affecting the price. Anyone can buy or sell, the delay of the withdrawals is not significant."
29-2-2-4-1-1,How can delays in transactions not affect the prices?
29-2-2-5,Push this to the top
29-2-4,It means the clowns are stuck.
29-2-5,"The internet is a series of pipes and only so many bitcoins can physically be pushed through the pipe, so now there is a blockege. A long-limbed plumber has been called and he can hopefully reach in and wiggle the blockage loose."

29-3-1-1-1,0?
29-3-1-1-1-1,The price is whatever we say it is
29-3-1-1-1-1-2,"No, the price is what someone else says it is. If I have something and I say it's worth $1m, it's only worth $1m if someone would give me $1m for it. Otherwise it's worth whatever someone else will give me for it. I can say whatever the hell I want, but that doesn't make it the price if no one would buy it for that."
29-3-1-1-1-2,still more valuable and sound than tesla stocks.
29-3-2,Lowest level of BTC on exchanges and now people wants their BTC back. Time to buy binance.
29-3-4,If you bought bitcoin… how did they run out? Oh right cause you don’t actually own any bitcoin it’s just I.O.U’s
29-3-4-1,"That is largely true for your current account too. Your balance is not just sat there, your bank has put it somewhere and if a critical mass of people attempted to withdraw their balance it would be a problem—cash simply wouldn't be there."
29-3-4-1-2,What if i told you there is something called the FDIC. Crypto doesn’t have that safety net.
29-3-4-1-2-3,"And if there is a bank run, and the bank is out of cash on hand, it may take days for the fed to restock them, depending on how many other banks are being run on."

29-3-4-1-5,"This should be less risky than a bank, in theory.  A bank lends out a large percentage of deposits.  They transform them into assets of varying liquidity.  Much more similar to what's happening with Celsius.In Binance case, the model is (or is supposed to be) that they simply hold your assets in liquid form.  They do not reinvest them.  I haven't seen any specific proof to the contrary."
29-3-4-2,"The Bitcoin Mempool is currently sitting around 40m bytes, which is the highest it's been for the past several months.Here's what I suspect happened:A Binance employee must've moved a large amount of funds from one of their cold wallets to another hot wallet to pay their customers for withdrawals.

29-4,"Oh, a a crypto exchange that doesn't allow people to withdraw their funds when the market is crashing, what a surprise"

29-4-1-2-4,Hopefully people realize that this fraud along with unbacked tether wash trading is the only reason crypto ever had a price point beyond triple digits
29-4-1-4,"No, I actually like exchanges becsuse statistically, big picture, about 5x fewer BTC are lost on them than in self custody.Yeah sometimes your seatbelt gets tangled in your neck and kills you, but way more often, it saves your life. So people tend to wear seatbelts if they're smart and like living longer. People tend to avoid self custody if they like having more money"
29-4-1-4-2,>about 5x fewer BTC are lost on them than in self custodyOn what basis do you make this claim?
29-4-2,"People still won't learn anything and will insist that their crypto is ""decentralized"""
29-4-2-1,"Exchanges aren't as decentralized, no. It's that you just lose all your money on them way less often than in self custody.Turns out people like having more money a lot more than they like their loyalty to vague principles. This is my shocked face."
29-4-2-1-3,Bro do you work for an exchange or something?
29-4-3,"To be fair, if the market is crashing, shouldn’t you hold?I’m not agreeing that mommy should take away my car keys. But isn’t now the worst time to bail? People have answered askreddit questions for years!! I would have bought more at a lower price. So buy more. It will recover. And I’m not saying that because I’m an ape that’s going to the moon. You will notice that I’m not active on those subs. Stop loss is a real thing. And people should be able to stop loss if they understand enough about this gamble to know what that means. But why cash out?"
29-4-3-1,"It depends on if you believe it will ever recover. If you owned enron stock right now you wouldn’t be saying the same thing. Also, some people need to sell because they borrowed to invest. So, they are more sensitive to downward trends."
29-4-5,Calm you SHIB soul. Its still possible to withdraw via BEP20
29-4-5-1,BEP20 isn’t the native Bitcoin chain
29-4-5-1-2,"True, but withdrawal it still possible."
29-4-5-1-2-2,"Bep20 Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin, it's just IOU Bitcoin XXX Binance"
29-5,"PSA: If your coins are still on an exchange, get them off and into a wallet as soon as possible."
29-5-1,What if your coins are on Binance? lol
29-5-1-1,"Woe. First time I've seen another Yam in the wild.If your BTC is on binance, best thing you can do right now is cry."
29-5-1-1-1,You can actually still withdraw BTC. Just not through the BTC network.
29-5-1-5,You will lose them / unable to sell prior to rich people and exchanges selling at higher prices before tanking.
29-5-3,"But then you pretty much need a hardware key purchased directly from the manufacturer.  Can't trust something like Exodus on it's own with almost daily updates coming in.  What are the odds they get hacked and someone slips in an update that empties everyone's wallets.  Maybe even from someone inside the company.  We are potentially talking about massive amounts of money so motivation is high.  You can bet some of the best hackers in the world are trying.  It could be the hack of the century.All things considered, I would say that a large well-financed company like Binance, that relies on their reputation for attracting new customers, would be a safer alternative to a non-hardware key wallet for moderate holdings.  If you have a large amount of crypto then definitely a wallet with hardware key is the way to go."
29-5-3-2,These all sound like questions that should have been pondered before recklessly dumping tons of money into this worthless ponzi lmao
29-5-4,Wouldn’t that make the situation worse?
29-5-4-1,Not for you if you don't have any funds left on the exchange
29-5-4-1-1,Wouldnt large exchanges failing still probably kill the price?
29-5-5,All I have been able to use is PayPal. I am an immigrant and exchanges don't let me sign up since I'm not a citizen of where I live. Is there a way to transfer PayPal crypto to a wallet?
29-5-5-1,Not right now unfortunately no. However Paypal did announce last year plans to implement such a feature in the near future. I don't believe they gave an actual time frame outside of 2022-2023 range. Rather vague but for now your just stuck waiting.I have a little crypto myself on Paypal. It was merely to test out the feature back when it debuted though. Waiting myself for the ability to transfer it to a cold wallet some day.
30,It happened: bitcoin just went below its all time high from 2017.
30-1,Did someone just market sell enough BTC to cause a 5% drop?
30-1-1,Whale just vomited.
30-1-1-1,"Just like an Ayahuasca ritual BTC has these nauseating breakdowns followed by imperative diarrhea, but once through everybody will declare that this horrifying deep cleanse was badly needed for reflection and self-realization."
30-1-1-1-2,I have been saying this.  But I don’t have 50k followers.
30-1-1-1-3,One wonders when you guys notice that you’re just lice on the big players.
30-1-1-2,El Salvador got out lol
30-1-1-2-4,"Got out and went where?  Bitcoin's still better for them than dollars.  They aren't ""getting out""."
30-1-5,"Institution, probably"
30-1-5-1,"Only a whale would dump it all at once to drive the price down.Some miners are forced to sell, they do it slowly or over the counter.I don't think there are that many leveraged traders now that there is a washout, not very profitable to make large fast sells."
30-1-5-1-1,Selling to drive the price down? Isn’t that counterintuitive?
30-1-5-1-1-1,Nope! You short sell futures. You dump spot. You Sell your futures shorts with massive profit. Rinse and repeat
30-1-5-1-1-1-2,Can you explain this to me as if I’m 10 years old ?
30-1-5-1-1-1-2-2,"Here is an example with Shares instead. PBS Two cents is a great resource to learn basics of most financial aspects, it might seem patronizing though since target audience is teenagers, but sometimes that helps. "
30-1-5-1-1-1-3,Something ive been thinking about.  If they keep dumping and we keep buying and HODLing.  Dont they slowly loose the power to move the BTC market over time?
30-2,"When I said money’s not real, I didn’t mean MY money."
30-3,"BTC never goes below previous ATH, except when it does."
30-3-1,All cycle theories were just debunked
30-3-1-1,Still got the rainbow chart: 
30-3-1-1-2,What this doesn’t show is the other end of the rainbow that leads to the pot of gold chocolate coins.
30-3-1-1-3,"As per the chart, we may stay at these prices until 2024 lol"
30-3-1-1-3-1,"This chart is fun to look at, but the logarithmic y axis and general inconsistencies in a pattern kinda ruin it.The rainbow does not stay consistent in size throughout and even with it being stretched like it is, it struggles to keep the trend between the different peaks and valleys.I’m not a statistician, nor am I a crypto person, but IMHO this chart is only good for amusement. And yes, I know the chart is a joke, but I just want to say this for everyone in the back."
30-3-1-1-3-1-1,Having a logarithmic axis is the whole point. From elsewhere: The vertical distance on the log scale for the move from 2 to 4 is the same as that of the move from 20 to 40. This simply means that prices doubled and provides for valid comparisons at any price level.
30-3-3,"Always been a fallacy, if you count wicks on the weekly, the APR 2013 high over laps the lows from JAN & AUG 2015."
30-3-3-1,Exactly what I was thinking. Unfortunately the macro economic environment makes me think this time we will feel more pain before going up again
30-3-3-1-1,"Exactly, todays Bitcoin drop makes me think we'll see even more red in the stock market next week. I'm lucky that my DCA is sub 5k, so I'm okay to just keep hodling, as I don't want to risk timing the markets and I see this as a long term speculative investment."
30-3-3-1-1-1,"Do you worry that in the time it takes for macro conditions to turn back around some other protocol better equipped than btc to meet its use cases won't emerge,  wiping out its value?"
30-3-4,New pattern unlocked: **Great Depression**
30-3-5,BTC never goes below previous ATH..... AFTER reaching the cycle top.Perhaps we havent touched the top yet? 
30-4,Soon we can dust off the “it’s over 9000!” memes. It will be so nostalgic.
30-4-3," I can whole heartily say that ""Vegeta"" meme got me to make my first purchase I'm BTC in 2017"
30-5,"****looks in the mirror, takes a deep breath****“Have fun staying poor.”"
30-5-1,Don't worry it will go down to 10k and then magically go back up to 100k and beyond because it always happens. And everyone will get a lambo. Right guys?
30-5-1-2,only if we get more dumbasses to invest
30-5-1-2-2,There is 4.3 milions subs here and Jay-Z is promoting crypto. How much more popular is it going to get? How many more dumbasses there are?Is the thought that PERHAPS 60k USD was the celling and it's going to be a slow decline (or fast) from now on really that scary?
30-5-1-2-2-3,I think all the dumbassed out there have already been fleeced.
30-5-1-2-2-4,They say once your grandma knows about it - it's no longer popular.
30-5-1-2-4,"Let's see what can we get in coming days man, we are waiting."
30-5-1-2-4-1,"I think this bear market is gonna last a long time. Until the fed turns dovish. BTC is basically a tech stock, so it won’t go up until folks are risk-on again."
30-5-1-2-5,"A sucker is born every minute, and younger generations dig bitcorn."
30-5-1-3,This is what literally happens BTW
30-5-1-3-1,That's what literally happens is that the earth rotates around the sun due to gravity. Bitcoin going up in price is literally a casino. It could just quite literally crash and burn.
30-5-1-3-1-1,"That's an amazing flaw in understanding.Bitcoin usually goesup by nature(cuz its a  hedge to inflation) and ordinary people buy it, however it pumps and dumps when speculators and institutions invest in it while srocks are green and sell when stocks are red, because they don't understand the technology and think of Bitcoin as of a risky stock.Right now the bubble inflated by institutions/investors, who are selling due to the stock market crash. We now will see the true price of Bitcoin(the people who hold it genuinly) and it'll go up. I don't know what this price is.Maybe 14k, maybe 10k  mabe 1k. It doesnt matter to me, because in 4 years I'll make 10x regardless, and most importantly, I'll support the technology of the future."
30-5-1-3-1-1-1,"Ah yes, you will definitely make a 10x increase on your money in 4 years. You figured it out man, you will be a multi millionaire. Genius"
31,Warren Buffett says he wouldn't pay $25 for all the bitcoin in the world — and Charlie Munger blasts the crypto as 'stupid' and 'evil'
31-1,I'll start the bidding at $100 for all the Bitcoin in the world. Sold? Great.
31-1-1,"tbh if I didn't ""believe"" in Bitcoin I'd still buy it for $25. I'd be a non believer not a stupid atleast."
31-1-1-1,"I think he also didn’t buy Apple for ages because he didn’t understand tech. Dude takes a while, he’ll come around"
31-1-1-1-1,"He just follows the advice ""don't invest in what you don't understand"", nothing wrong with that."
31-1-1-1-1-1,This is a generous perspective and a legit strategy.
31-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Back in the 30s when Buffet and Munger were young, it was a legit strategy. Today, anyone who claims to understand what they're investing in is a liar. Securitization of derivatives and the insanely complex structure of markets and their participants mean that if you need to understand... well, maybe you were better off just working a job anyway."
31-1-1-1-1-1-1-2,"Investing in companies you don’t understand is more like gambling. Maybe that’s the case for you, but I wouldn’t put every investor in the same boat. Just because you have no idea what you’re doing doesn’t mean everyone is clueless…"
31-1-1-1-1-2,"It would follow that you shouldn't disparage what you don't understand, either."
31-1-1-1-1-4,"Also he's right, crypto is just not a solid sound investment.You can make a nice chunk of money, sure, but it's a highly HIGHLY speculative gamble.Not something investors like Buffet are really into."
31-1-1-1-1-4-3,He's talking about bitcoin. I highly suggest you learn a little more about what makes bitcoin uniquely positioned as store of value.  That youre lumping it in with the rest of crypto is a little naive
31-1-1-1-1-4-4,"I would argue that it's no more speculative, maybe even less so, than investing in companies that lose money, and Berkshire owns Snowflake."
31-1-1-1-3,"the guy is 91 years old,  avg life expectancy in US is 79.   Something tells me he might not have enough gas left in the tank to come around on the time table we might be looking at. crypto does not represent serious investing to me by that I mean I don't plan my retirement around it and I've been in it quite a long time, it's still a hobby, and I view it more of a lottery ticket that's fun/interesting than something I can rely on 30 years down the line when retirement age comes. I think it will absolutely change the world give enough time.  Luckily I got plenty of it left.  Who knows, maybe in 40 years it will let me afford to have some kind of gold hover E-chair in the retirement home :)"
31-1-1-1-3-1,This conference is two 90 year olds clout chasing….0 innovation still talking about using oil 200 years from now. They should just get a tik tok .I tired to listen to it for 20 minutes and honestly all I heard was their dentures .
31-1-1-1-4,"It's easy to take your time when you're already one of the richest men on the planet anyway. Not to discredit his achievements, but the man built his wealth over time, with a solid head start in life, and under drastically different economic conditions than we live in today. Id love to see what would happen if he started over with $5,000 today."
31-1-1-1-4-1,"Wouldn’t the fact that he continued to build his wealth over 70 years across different economic conditions from high inflation to tech to real estate, commodity boom bust be a testament to his achievements?One can have very good head start and still lose it all over time. The fact that he didn’t…"
31-1-1-1-4-3,"Another young punk that thinks in the 60’s through the 90’s money just poured from the sky. I guarantee you, Buffet and you could start from zero today and in 10 years he would out invest you 10:1."
31-1-1-1-4-3-1,"Sure, that's it. Nothing to do with wage stagnation, cost of living increases, or the fact buffet never had to choose between helping support his family or investing.Not that I was trying to compare, but good luck beating anyone in 10 years when it takes you that long to actually buy anything in the first place."
31-1-1-1-4-3-1-1,"There’s a lot of money to be made out there. But you have to be located in certain areas of the country. The coasts are too expensive, some areas of the south too poor. Lots of money to be made in the trades where I live. If I was of your generation I would find a way to make money, be it second job or buying the worst home on the block and doing long term flips."
31-1-1-4,You just not to be blind and use logic to recognize a good investment. Saying that type of stuff just show how bad investor he is.
31-1-1-4-1,Did you just call Warren Buffett as a bad investor?
31-1-1-4-1-1,"What they said doesn't imply he is a bad investor? Old people just don't get crypto and don't even know how to use it. If I showed him how easy it is to invest in crypto & how much money I made in 1 year 18-19 yrs old, he would start doing it I'm sure."
31-1-1-5,"Well i believe he means that that $25 has then bought you a distraction and an influence that you may end up wishing you were better off not knowing.I.e you can pay $15 a month for a video game subscription, but then you consider ‘opportunity costs’ and the fact that you waisted that year playing the video game instead of doing something else"
31-1-2,"Bad move. If you own all the bitcoin in the world it would no longer have any value. You can’t sell it as you need to hold all of it. You can’t spend or trade it as you need to have all of it. A single coin for $100 dollars however, you wouldn’t be able to sit comfortably because you’d be sitting there with a massive crypto hard on."
31-1-2-1,"Congratulations. You have solved the riddle of the oracle of Omaha. He is saying it has no productive value so if you have no one to sell it to, it's worth nothing."
31-1-2-1-1,"Could say the same of gold, couldn't you?"
31-1-2-1-1-2,"I'm no gold bug, but those guys like to point out that 10% of the worlds supply of gold is used in industrial applications like electronics, and then of course there's jewelry (rapper's teeth, wedding rings etc)&#x200B;"
31-1-2-1-1-2-1,"You can make jewelry out of anything. Only reason gold jewelry is desirable is because the gold industry says it is, which is how most industries function on that note."
31-1-2-1-1-3,Bitcoin minors and original are the only winners. Everyone else is just liquidity. After everyone that can afford it buys it then what? Pray that a black swan event doesn’t wipe you out by then big hand will be liquidated just like we’re seeing now in the index’s.
31-1-2-1-1-5,Nah gold has many industry uses from electronics to its reflective properties in buildings and the visors of astronaut. Not to mention it uses as a catalyst in some chemical process and industrial processes. It is also good at reflecting infrared radiation. Gold will always have value. Just alot less since it is dominated by jewelry.
31-1-3,There was probably a time when they were $100
31-1-3-1,"""I don't think the Internet is going to change how people chew gum. I look for businesses in which I think I can predict what they're going to look like in ten to fifteen years time. Take Wrigley's chewing gum. I don't think the internet is going to change how people chew gum."""
31-1-3-2,If only there is a time machine
31-1-3-2-1,I wish I knew what Bitcoin is back in 2010
31-1-3-2-1-2,Aren't we all? But it's easy to say but hard to do.I know in 2017 and bought the first one back then but miss the opportunities to buy in 2019 and 2020. Should have bought more. Anyway.
31-1-3-3,The first transaction was 10K BTC for a pizza. Idk the size of the pizza.
31-1-3-3-2,Getting to $1 was the hardest part. Wish I could've been there to see it live
31-1-3-3-2-1,I remember talking to someone about it back then but it seemed really complicated at the time and the information was all over the place.  It’s wild it’s come this far. Who knew? 
31-1-3-3-2-1-1,"Same oh my god, I didn't because why would I risk $50 to some website with literally like 45 seconds of designing. They looked SO questionable I'm surprised people that have made it big haven't brought it up more"
31-1-4,"Says the guys who didn’t understand and believe in investing in tech for the longest period of time. Warren had a chance to invest in Intel’s first round, sat on a board with the founder, and wouldn’t invest Berkshire Hathaway or personal funds in the deal."
31-2,Warren Buffett is famous for saying that he only invest in things he understands. That explains a lot
31-2-1,"Maybe he understands that if he owned all the bitcoin in the world, it would make bitcoin worthless.Why spend $25 on it then?"
31-2-1-4,"that doesnt then mean all the demand for bitcoin disappears.. Its not like people arent buying bitcoin today, or tomorrow.You would own all the liquidity, you could raise and lower the price by your own choice.Owning all the bitcoin in the world is great for the one person who owns it all. It's only if you mishandled it that it would be worth less."
31-2-4,He does mention he prefer things that give value that don't have to be sold to get the value from it. The difference between buying a house you can rent out versus buying a rare coin to sell it for higher later.
31-5,So they are the same as the two drunk chicks who wanted $100 cash over 1 BTC
31-5-1,"No. Buffett is worth over $100billion because he’s spent his life only investing in companies/sectors he understands. He’s not saying crypto is a bad investment, just that he doesn’t know enough about it."
32,"The first website to buy bitcoin went online 13 years ago today- You could buy 1,309 BTC for $1.00 USDThe website New Liberty Standard was the first website to offer Bitcoin purchases. You were able to buy and sell Bitcoin through Paypal.  The person who created the ""exchange"" basically priced Bitcoin at the average cost to mine Bitcoin."
32-1,"Yes sure, put more salt in our crypto wound."
32-1-1,Not feeling hurt. I would have sold long before it reached $1. All of us would have done so.
32-1-1-1,"You would've left couple of btc just in case, at least this is how it works in my imagination."
32-1-1-1-1,I myself would have not. If it reached $1? I would have spent this amount and netted $1299. BTC was the only coin around and this price increase was seen as a huge bubble. I'd take my profits and run.
32-1-1-1-1-1,"The problem I had at the time was actually selling it and converting it to cash in the bank. AFAIK, there wasn't a good way to do it or it was all sketchy. At the time, my dad told me,> ""It's all fake. Tell me you're rich once you actual have the money in the bank. Until then, it's all fairy dust"".  So to show my dad once and for all I loaded all my BTC to Mt.Gox and sold it all at ~$1100. I then proceeded to start a bank transfer.... I think they said 5-8 banking days, but after ~two weeks the transaction status was `taking longer than expected` and by ~3 weeks it said `experiencing technical difficulties`, and on week ~4 it became global news that people couldn't withdraw funds. To which I tried to move my remaining BTC back to my wallet (bought back in some) but that experienced the same `technical difficulties`. Then ~two weeks after that the site went offline. Dad was right."
32-1-1-1-4,And then they would have been stolen in the mt Gox heist... I think it's extremely few individuals who would hodl from the early days 2009-2012 all the way to 2022.  I find this comforting atleast.
32-1-3,"Even if you didn’t want to buy back then, there was a faucet that gave you 5 BTC for doing a captcha "
32-1-3-1,"I remember the faucet and thinking who would go on and claim that since it's basically worthless and can't really buy anything with such small amount, ***boy I was wrong***"
32-1-3-1-1,hind sight makes us all stupid.
32-1-3-1-1-1,I considered the use case of it which was basically for black market transactions. Under that model it was just a currency and wouldn't have much value so it wasnt interesting. I didn't see it as a store of value that could replace gold. If I had I would have likely bought a bunch
32-2,Don't be harsh on yourselves. Nobody in that time saw the price increase. Most of us would have sold long before it reached $1k.Be happy now you know how to buy and what is possible.
32-2-1,Yea hindsight is a hell of a drug. You could say the same about so many collectible items out there as well ( like Pokémon cards or old games )
32-2-1-1,"Talking about drugs, I bet many of the early adopters of btc where into drugs back then, probably several regret having wasted millions of dollars on cheap drugs nowadays"
32-2-1-1-1,"Bro do you know how much I spent on some dn markets... Spent around 40BTC from 2014-18I remember my first order: shipped from Holland, 50 grams of mdma for £300. It cost ~0.8BTC."
32-2-2,"Hell, I'm sure most would've sold well before tha even. We're talking ~$0.001 per BTC here, I would've been out at  $1 with my immense 1300x gains thinking I'm Warren Buffet lol"
32-2-3,This. Not many would've been diamond handed enough to hold through all that. That's why I'm not worried about what could've been.
32-2-3-1,"Exactly! If you bought 1300 BTC for $1 and didn't sell when it reached $1 (therefore netting $1299), you would have been called mad. Hindsight is 20/20."
32-2-3-1-3,"I thought I was the smartest guy alive for buying a handful at $50 and selling at $400. I also bought a paid of headphones for ~2 btc, I still have them and I'm reminded that they costed me $120k at bitcoins peak. Cruel world."
32-2-4,"Exactly this. I bought some BTC when I was in college back in 2012 and they were around $12 apiece. I sold them, got my money back. Dwelling on could have/should have doesn't help anything."
32-2-5,There is something you could acquire for dirt cheap *right now* that could make you rich in 5 years.   Nobody thought Bitcoin would be more than a tech demo when I got into it in 2012.
32-2-5-1,Lots were using it to play poker during this time. After the US shut down full-tilt and pokerstars sites.
32-3,"Back in the day I bought 15 bitcoin for like $6 and forgot about it. When the price hit $30k it sparked a memory of my old bitcoin wallet. All I needed to do was find the bitcoin wallet info that I kept in a draft on my old Hotmail account and I would be over $300k richer. I was so excited, I've always been pretty poor and it seemed like my luck was finally changing. Except it wasn't. I opened the inbox expecting to find years of unread emails but it was completely empty. No inbox, no spam and no drafts. It turned out that at some point Hotmail had completely cleared the accounts of any users that hadn't logged for years. Somewhere there is a bitcoin wallet with 15 bitcoin in it and it's going to be stuck in there forever."
32-3-1,Cant you ask microsoft to restore it?
32-3-1-1,"I tried at the time, the response was that they had all been permanently deleted when Microsoft migrated all Hotmail accounts to Outlook and that I was given the opportunity to log in and save the emails from deletion in emails sent to my recovery email address. But as I also hadn't used that one for years, I missed all the emails."
32-3-1-1-1,Oh dear lord. At this point I would have offered to pay them if they managed to restore it. I am sure that it is not impossible.
32-3-1-1-1-1,"Dear Microsoft,I am a bit of a princely type but try to stay humble. I am writing you about a strong opportunity. I have a crypto wallet with $3.2 million dollars in it but I have lost the keys. This is where I need some help, I need you to give me the backdoor key and in exchange after I verify all the funds I will happily remit 10% of the recovered funds.All I need to get started is $500. Please I trust to hear you back.Dearest Sincerely Yours,T"
32-3-1-1-2,Im wondering if there is a possibility for them to restore some old snapshot of a server where your emails were
32-3-1-1-2-1,"Probably, somewhere, there is a backup on an old forgotten hard drive.  In a drawer, in a room, somewhere.  But good luck finding it - I have a similar situation with hushmail."
32-3-2,"I wonder if it's actually really deleted completely, or weather they keep something somehow.. maybe a GDPR request would uncover mail that's ""hidden"" from you?"
32-3-5,"You could try suing Microsoft for $300k, if you have any evidence of that email or bitcoins. Even without it, perhaps the legal process of discovery would itself actually reveal some old archive of emails?"
32-4,I remember taking nearly 4 days to mine just one BTC which was worth about 0.20c and thinking fuck this before deleting everything. To my one BTC that's still out there somewhere I'm sorry 
32-4-1,Similar story but I think I spent 3 months using a potato PC to mine a tiny fraction of a litecoin before giving up. That £0.0001 could be worth 10p now!
32-4-4,I think when I started ETH mining in 2017 with my 1070 GTX I'd make about 0.05 ETH/week @ 27mh/s. But it used to freeze the PC and the missus would always restart it so I didn't commit much.Fast Forward to 2022 and I had 800mh/s of processing power which would net me 0.2 ETH a month. So Similar except Eth back then was $600 and ETH peak mining was $6000 ($AUD).
32-4-5,"Similar story here. Spent 3 afternoons mining BTC on my crappy GPU. I had 0.2btc and decided it wasn't worth it and thought my parents would get mad over electricity usage. When I sold it recently, I've never wanted to turn back time more than when the money arrived in my bank. Ouch.Same with doge coin. Used to collect it from the faucets. 10-20 every 10 mins. After a couple of evenings, I thought there was no point, it's just a joke. Also sold that for £600 last year. If only younger me was more wise. Hindsight is 20/20."
32-5,If I stoped and solved a captcha for 5 seconds my life Would've been different.
32-5-1,Explain
32-5-1-1,
33,"When Bitcoin falls below $400,000"
33-1,"""Bitcoin falls below $4M.  The end is near for crypto"""
33-1-1,"“After falling below $4M, Peter Schiff declares Bitcoin dead.”"
33-1-1-1,“Bitcoin is going to zero after falling below $4M”
33-1-1-1-1,"""It's closer to zero than 10M"""
33-1-1-1-1-3,"Even a million needs zero to reach the level,but that's far away."
33-1-1-1-2,“Bitcoin. More like Shitcoin. I’ll be wearing a suit and tie as I watch the free fall of crypto begins”
33-1-1-2,“Gold just crossed $2000 and is sure to hit $3000”
33-1-1-2-2,Its funnier when they tell me silver is going to hit four digits.
33-1-1-2-2-1,I am sitting on several pounds of silver that I bought at $8 a troy oz in the mid-2000s. Still appreciated more than CD's and money markets. Wish I would have known or researched BTC back then.
33-1-1-2-2-1-1,"I sold my silver/gold in 2011 and bought back in, in 2016 when it was cheap again.Wish I had sank that all in BTC then."
33-1-1-2-5,"Gold and oil will continue to rise, so cryptocurrency will not fall. Don't worry about buying in large quantities"
33-1-1-3,"""Gold rises 10% to $1,700 as Bitcoin tumbles below $4 million."""
33-1-1-3-1,"This is only temporary, so as the currency falls below, it is an opportunity to buy in large quantities"
33-2,Don't buy bitcoin. .
33-2-2,Man this needs to be updated with at least two more crashes.
33-2-3,Some retard on r/wallstreetbets is gonna buy it anyway
33-4,"Each news history is 4 years from each:1. 2014 -> $4002. 2018 -> $4,0003. 2022 -> $40,000So $400,000 will be on 2026"
33-4-2,"So 4 years on from now on... That's fine, will concentrate on finding a nice wife meanwhile. Time to ignore the price for 4 years.But shit when I buy every month I see it anyway."
33-4-3,I get well meaning calls from friends when they see these stories on the news.  A very close friend and brilliant guy called me yesterday to tell me that the government was going to ban Bitcoin over Russia. I don't bother trying to explain things anymore.  I spend every waking hour following the news and charts.  Just to make sure my premise is still solid.  I don't try to help/advise friends and family anymore.  They will find out on their own.  I succumbed to naysayers back in 2014 and made the worst financial decision of my life.  I didn't have the depth of knowledge and understanding that I have now.  I was lucky in 2014 when I stumbled on Bitcoin and made a few bucks but I had no idea how lucky I really was.  Not being cocky or bragging but I do feel like the smartest guy in the room now.  You aren't going to ring me up and tell me anything about Bitcoin that I am not aware of but appreciate the concern.
33-4-3-1,"I had the btc news articles up in 2008-10, had a new computer. Never mined a single coin... just played wow.... then later on I had kids around the time it 'crashed' to 10k from 17k and I started buying in, DOH! Been a nice run. But if only I had started earlier... I guess that's about everyone here though."
33-4-3-1-1,"I remember a headline, ages ago, entitled “the rise and fall of bitcoin.” It had shot all the way up to $25, before crashing down to $9. I did not purchase my first bitcoin until long long loooong after that."
33-4-3-1-2,Yeah..it I only had a time machine lol.  I would have done many things in life differently.  But I am at least able to learn from my mistakes of the past.
33-4-3-2,"lol, same here. It's occasionally fun to listen to someone with very little idea of how Bitcoin works try to explain it to someone with zero idea of how it works.Overall, all I got from advising family to buy Bitcoin is that occasionally someone will tell a random friend that I own Bitcoin, and I have to tediously explain how I lost it all in a boating accident."
33-5,"That’s really interesting. If history repeats itself I can’t wait for the next few cycles. I first heard about Bitcoin, and still have the emails taking about it, in June 2011 but felt it was too difficult to buy at the time. Plus it crashed from $17.50 to $0.01 and if I had wanted to buy anything on Silk Road I would have had to buy thousands and thousands. I’m a sad sad idiot."
33-5-2,"I think it'll crash with stocks as many many ordinary ppl get panicked and pull out. However, that is a phenomenal dip that will be the best opportunity for this sub and those who started following but kept saying it's too expensive. That said, even buying now and not waiting for a dip will reward you many times over in a few years time"
33-5-4,"I spent over 400 Bitcoin on TSR in '11, between $4 & $11 each. Great MDMA and Acid, no regrets.I think my actually using it helped people realise its value and contributed to its success."
34,"Call to action: Bills are currently being rushed through committee in MANY states that would redefine money, such that Crypto currency is excluded, and the way is paved for CBDCs to take their place. CBDCs are bad enough, but if Crypto is not allowed as a valid form of money, we're screwedWhat does my title mean for GME?The wording in the bill (below) MEANS - after the government launches CBDC, every other form of crypto is BANNED, etc. It also means NFT's marketplace, be your own bank. etc."
34-1,Money is w/e people will take in exchange for goods and services. The Government can eat my whole ass and my ass hole.
34-1-1,"Came here to say this.. if we all just agree to use crypto and reject cbdc’s they can’t do shit about it…edit: and if they disallow buying of crypto, we just barter. Fuck these asshats."
34-1-1-1,"I mean if crypto isn't a currency and it isn't nothing then isn't exchanging crypto already bartering? What are they gonna do, outlaw bartering entirely?"
34-1-1-1-1,"I have had some form of crypto for a decade...  I have NEVER paid my taxes WITH any form of it and never considered it the chosen legal tender of the U.S., my coins aren't even 'money' to me, they are a store of value, a speculation interest, and a hobby.To accomplish anything that successfully illegalizes possession of methods to access crypto itself for some thin BS, they'd have to go fascist on a thin line against any store of value, intangible investments, and Web 3.0 development corporately as well as many citizen's growing hobbies."
34-1-1-5,You seem to forget about all the normies that will gladly comply out of ignorance and be thankful for the delicious incentives that are offered. What are you going to Not buy fuel or food or be able to pay your bills? If we don’t fight against it and we just say fuck them we will surely lose.
34-1-1-5-1,"There is truth to this. Unfortunately many people have no idea about the corruption in this world and happily take whatever they’re given. Hopefully the coming recession, recent “totally not” bailouts, and pending devaluation of the dollar will get people to open their eyes… I know that I’ve talked to some people about all of this stuff. Most labeled me a conspiracy theorist, but when it comes to fruition maybe they’ll realize that the media they’ve been consuming and narratives they’ve been choosing to believe are lies.. we can only hope, buy, drs, hodl, and spread the word.. and commenting to state lawmakers can’t hurt either, though I personally think money’s gonna money and power’s gonna power regardless of what we say or do (but again, can’t hurt to try).."
34-1-1-5-1-1,It is extremely exhausting trying to enlighten people. The quality of life and living conditions are getting worse by the day. This should open more people’s eyes. This is an uphill battle but if we don’t try and give it our all then we will never know what could have been. There is a saying “ a coward dies a thousand deaths “. I spent the last two years coming here and believing in this and I still do and ill be damned to have come this far just to throw my hands up or say “ I should of tried harder “. the time is now to get loud! Call your reps harass these people on Twitter they work for us! They are public servants. Our tax dollars fund their salary’s.
34-1-1-5-1-1-1,"It's exhausting to watch my generation blindly walk into what's happening when we were taught in school to watch out for what's happening.  It's... baffling.The greed and corruption, and how the little people end up paying for the mistakes and largess of the elites, how the shackles of oppression that were thrown off 250 years ago are worse than ever.What a time to be alive.  I'm down $110k from when I bought in.  I'll lose it all before realizing a loss.  I am exhausted though."
34-1-1-5-1-1-1-1,"I haven't slept well in two years, I can feel my health deteriorating. I used to have such a nice savings account and far less stress than I do now being all inI feel like the ""just be zen"" sentiments are just a memeI'm tired, I'm battered, I'm so ready to be done, but I'm also not selling"
34-1-5,"Law says you are required to accept USD for all debts/services.You can offer chickens/crypto/shares of gme for your debts, but the counterpart is under no obligation to accept.  Legally.Just being clear on why USD exists.    I don't think you can ban the offering without coming into a collision with the established commerce laws.   Currently crypto is legally considered akin to a stock holding.CBDC will be legal tender like USD...acceptance of it will be the question."
34-1-5-1,"When they say this is how you get your meds and buy your groceries 95% of sheeple will say ok, I guess you know best Uncle Sam"
34-2,"If cryptocurrency is no longer money, then we don’t have to pay taxes on it.This is not to say that it would be a good thing."
34-2-1,"There would be no taxes to pay, as it would likely be illegal at that point.  So no taxes, but criminal enforcement if you're found using it."
34-2-1-1,Idk about that. It's like saying I can't trade 5 chickens for 1 goat at that point...
34-2-1-1-2,"No different than how you have to be licensed to run games of chance, or other things.  They can't stop you from doing it, but they can make it illegal, then selectively enforce to keep the ""right people"" in line."
34-2-1-1-4,"No it would be like saying ""This is contraband and you've been found to be using it"". The law is the law. A lot of you are going to get a real shock as to how quickly written law can change and then be enforced."
34-2-1-1-4-1,But the way it's worded brings everything else into question and then sets a precedent.  I feel like that's a big line to cross. A really fucking big one.
34-2-1-1-4-2,"I just don't realistically see them being able to fully enforce a law preventing people from using crypto, they can't even stop the black market drug trade and literally everyone smokes cannabis in states where it's still illegal. If they do color me surprised, as I'm not saying it's impossible, just in my opinion very unlikely."
34-2-1-1-4-2-1,"100% enforcement, sure, thats not going to happen.But the US only needs to label crypto as illegal and it will destroy it nearly entirely - it will be sent to an illegal underground and that will be it. Say goodbye to any kind of adoption, or the idea of any business in the US even using crypto for anything."
34-2-1-2,"In the US you're still legally required to declare illegally earned income and pay taxes on it.Why?  So that they can book you on tax evasion without having to prove the actual ""crime"" occurred.Al Capone was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for tax evasion."
34-2-1-3,what about capital gains?
34-2-1-3-1,"What about it?  If you make capital gains on an illegal activity, you're at risk for criminal enforcement, same as any crime.Not saying it will definitely play out this way, just saying it's one possible outcome."
34-2-5,"Securities are not considered money and you have to pay taxes on those? Your statement didn’t make much sense lol, something being classified as money doesn’t mean there are no taxes"
34-2-5-1,"My statement is if something has no monetary value, and I can’t legally exchange it for money, I legally can’t be taxed for it. That would be like having a tax stamp to deal coke."
34-2-5-1-1,"Except that you *are* supposed to pay taxes on illicit activity. If you sell coke, the IRS wants you to pay taxes on that income. The IRS dgaf about legality — they just want their cut. "
34-3,"Just shows how old and out of touch the decrepit ruling class is with society. Crypto can't be stopped, money is whatever is trusted as a medium of exchange and I certainly don't trust any shitfedcoin they come up with. Use actual privacy coins that don't use KYC and the central bankers can go get fucked."
34-3-1,"Sure, but do not be lulled into complacency by this idea.Scroll up and read the comment near the top about how this is gonna mirror the war on drugs if they get what they want here.The idea that they can't stop it is totally valid, but the hell they'll put us through trying to stop it is going to be, well, hell even so"
34-4,So they have a new system set up with loopholes for themselves already included. This is infuriating.
34-4-1,"They do NOT have it setup yet. These bills are the framework for GO time. Some states are pushing back.. Hoping we kill it. These bills need to die before they get to governors. Even if for some reason it makes it to a governor, said governor can be educated and veto. We must take action."
34-4-1-1,All the crypto bros should be pitchforking this shit… ARE THEY???
34-4-1-1-2,People don 't even know. Our watchdog didn't see it until AFTER the MT state senate voted for it.
34-4-1-2,Gov Noem vetoed it last week in S. Dakota
34-4-2,"Haha, “loopholes.” If only, the whole system is a loophole. They will have as much need for loopholes and dodging regulation as Neo does dodging bullets.There’s nothing to “get around” when you have ultimate control."
34-5,Vote these fuckers out
34-5-3,"Lol, they’re republicans in solidly republican states. Best of luck with cleaning up the brainwashing of entire states."
35,"12 years ago today, history was made when Laszlo Hanzecz bought 2 pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins. First-ever item purchased with decentralized digital currency.Today May 22, 2022 crypto lovers are celebrating Bitcoin pizza day.  Our 12th anniversary.Previously cryptos were not accepted as a payment method, but after a man from Florida bought a meal using Bitcoin, that was all people could talk about."
35-1,"For everyone feeling bad for him, you are forgetting that at the time, him spending 10,000 on a pizza, meant that he could easily mine/buy another 10,000. He is for sure rich right now"
35-1-1,"TBH if he didn't do that , for all we know we never would have gotten here. His transaction was the first known purchase of physical goods with bitcoin.    It was his transaction that first proved Bitcoin had value. He is a legend."
35-1-1-1,This!  We had to start somewhere.  There had to be one little push to get the ball rolling and Laszlo Hanyecz was the one behind it.  That man is a financial pioneer.  Davy Crockett of the crypto world.
35-1-1-1-3,"Actually, the poppa John’s who accepted it is the real hero here. Lots of people wanted to pay for things with Btc, it was the corporate acceptance that was the paradigm shift."
35-1-1-1-3-1,What? You do realize that poppa johns did not accept bitcoin as payment right?. Papa johns had no clue that bitcoin was even being involved with this trade. Stop pretending like corporations are superheroes.
35-1-1-1-3-1-2,"So who accepted it? People were spending it p2p already, the pizzas meaningless if that’s all it was."
35-1-1-1-3-1-2-2,"Yes it was p2p. And no, nobody actually traded p2p for an actual physical item. Who accepted the btc? The random guy on the internet that agreed to do the pizza trade with Lazlo.It was the first purchase ever with bitcoin."
35-1-1-1-3-2,Was it really corporate acceptance? It could have been one of those places that pay to use the papa johns brand. Unless Papa John's support btc as a payment method and I missed something. But it's still a step
35-1-1-2,"Exactly, some people are laughing at him but crypto is meant to be used not stored in a refrigerator. Thanks to people like him we are advancing and more adoption is coming."
35-1-2,"Also, everyone feels bad for him when we're forgetting that on the other side of the transaction someone made 10k BTC for selling 2 pizzas"
35-1-2-1,"But we know damn well they cashed that BTC out before it took off. That’s probably why we don’t ever hear about that store owner, gotta be disappointed that they basically sold away billions for a couple of bucks."
35-1-2-1-1,It wasn’t the store. Some other crypto person took the Bitcoin and used their credit card to buy him Papa John’s and have it delivered.
35-1-2-1-1-1,Concept still applies
35-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Not really. It's like me saying I can use pesos to buy pizza even tho I live in USA, when what I really do is give my buddy who is going to Mexico next week some pesos and he calls a pizza place and uses his own cash to buy it for me."
35-1-2-1-2,"But then what about the people they sold it to? Without all of these transactions happening,  slowly increasing in price we wouldn't be here today...."
35-1-2-1-2-1,"I don’t care, I look at crypto like stocks, not currency. Realistically no crypto is going to take over fiat in our lifetimes so I don’t see the point in buying crypto if you’re not going to either day trade it or hold long term for large gains in fiat. That’s ultimately why people invest in crypto, so they can see the value rise and exchange for more dollars anyway. The early people who sold are the losers while the early people who held were the only winners. Yeah, they started it’s popularity (sorta) but they personally gained nothing from it but becoming memes and missing out on generational wealth. BTC was bound to takeoff whether they made transactions or not. It was a shiny new concept that people were going to hop into eventually."
35-1-2-1-2-1-1,"> Realistically no crypto is going to take over fiat in our lifetimesDoes anyone actually expect that? It exists as an alternative to fiat, not a replacement. They serve different purposes"
35-1-2-1-2-1-1-1,"Crypto acts as an alternative to fiat currency only in the scope of possibly outpacing/out earning the SNP.  You invest in crypto to hopefully hit and eventually buyout with fiat currency. Whether you invest in real estate,  stocks, small business, etc during or after your crypto investment it's still fiat at the end of the day."
35-1-2-1-4,I mean if they cashed out at $1 who cares. $10k for $20 worth of pizza is a deal I take each time. Easy come easy go.
35-1-2-1-4-1,I doubt whoever ended up with it waited that long
35-1-3,I hope only the best for him.
35-1-3-2,"even worse, he spent over 100,000 bitcoins to buy random shit. he would be a billionaire if he had kept any of it."
35-1-3-2-1,"I’m sure if he had mined 100,000 to use on random shit over a single summer that he very likely had plenty more mined that he held on to. Besides back then he was literally just getting pizza for basically free, Bitcoin had no real concept of cost, there wasn’t any cult following nor did people actually expect it to become what it is. To him that summer was probably an epic one, free pizza all summer? Fuck yea."
35-4,It was on that day Bitcoin attained a real-world value. 1BTC equaled 1/5000 of a large pizza because of him.
35-4-1,"One small transaction for man, one giant leap for cryptocurrencies"
35-4-1-1,"One small pizza for man,one giant lep for bitcoin"
35-4-2,"And now 1 BTC equals about 1000 large pizzas, look how far we've come"
35-4-4,made history in crypto space forever while he was just enjoying these pizzas
35-5,"In this , he said that he doesn't regret it and that someone had to do it first. What a chad"
35-5-5,"Even tho he lost nearly $300 Million, he doesn't regret it. He truly is a chad."
35-5-5-2,He didn’t lose anything. Most of us wouldn’t even have thought of buying Bitcoin around that time
35-5-5-2-1,"I agree, I could've used a better word. He said in one of his interviews that he doesn't see it as a loss, but as a free meal he got back then."
35-5-5-2-1-1,I think that’s how people who dabbled in early bitcoin have to feel lol.  My original wallet had transactions for hundreds of BTC.  Like it got the job done back then and whenever BTC spiked I got free drugs out of the remainders.
36,"If You Bought Bitcoin in December 2017, You Have Now Lost Money"

36-2-1-1,ICP ATH buyers have entered the chat
36-2-1-1-3,Lmao they didnt even know what they where buying. They just saw it pop on coingecko in the top 10 one day and told themself “ayoo let me ape this”
36-2-1-1-3-1,I mean I'm totally bullish on the Internet AND computers so this feels like a winner.
36-2-1-1-3-1-1,Cant go tits up. 20x long it is
36-2-1-1-3-1-1-1,No Bitcoin would never go that much far this time I am sure
36-2-1-1-5,Damn I forgot about ICP. LolI only set 800 bucks on fire with that SC. Ironically meme crypto Shiba Inu is the only crypto I’m currently positive on after buying last summer. Saw it run up 1100% after purchasing and never took profits like a great big dummy. Now I’m only up about 30%. Lol
36-2-1-2,Feels real bad
36-2-1-2-2,Yes I am sure that many other people are also feeling bad
36-2-1-4,"A ton of people wish that was the case for them, they would still be holding BTC.Luna, Celsius, FTX holders have almost nothing."
36-2-2,It's okay. I'll just wait for the next ATH to FOMO in again
36-2-2-1,A little under 500 days until the next halving.  Mark your calendar.
36-2-2-1-1,If I could afford to buy new calendar by then.
36-2-2-1-1-1,You can anytime afford buying a calendar you can even use PDF calendar. There are many websites on the Internet which provide free PDF calendar for those are you cannot buy it with the real money
36-2-2-1-4,You will not have to wait that much I am sure that your money would be recovered very soon
36-2-3,Thanks. I'm sure it'll be at 100k any day now.
36-2-3-2,it'll be $100k end of 2021 trust me bro
36-2-3-2-1,This statement just reminds me of my bad decisions in life :/
36-2-3-4,Always thought it was funny that Plan B was anonymous and making such predictions - haven’t seen guys like that around lately but maybe I haven’t looked hard enough. 
36-2-3-5,You can keep dreaming about Bitcoin reaching hundred thousand dollars in this life
36-2-4,Fortune favors the brave.
36-2-4-1,"The brave buy now or maybe in a few weeks after the dust settles, not at ATH."
36-2-4-1-1,"Hate to break it to you man, this is going to last for a lot longer than that. Possibly 2 years at least. It’s not as simple as reading the chart, you have to pay attention to world events too because all that cascades through the markets"
36-2-4-1-1-1,"Oh, I don't disagree with there being a long winter and lower lows.  Best guess I have is that we get a rebound around next halving.  Who knows, maybe the Fed will have maxed rates and started easing again by then."
36-2-5,"I sold at 66k. I’ll never win again ever, so I’m not touching crypto ever again"
36-3,"Why so far into the past? If you bought Bitcoin today, you lost money "
36-3-1,I wonder how the president of El Salvador is feeling today
36-3-1-2,The Bitcoin holdings of El Salvador are minuscule compared to their economy. IMO it was more like a marketing trick to lure the rich crypto investors into the country and I think it was a net positive for the country. Sure they lost like 60 million but how many millions did flow into the country and how many jobs were created because of the investment.
36-3-1-2-2,Sounds like it genuinely did not go well though. Interesting article that came out a few days ago:
36-3-1-2-2-1,Damn. I recommend reading this. Really eye opening.Here you have a country doing everything possible to have poor people use bitcoin and still nobody wants to use it. You can't blame El Salvadors issues on bitcoin but it surely didn't help.
36-3-1-2-3,">but how many millions did flow into the country and how many jobs were created because of the investment.Ok, tell us. How many? If it had happened there'd be plenty of articles and information touting the successBeware commenters like this guy everyone ^They make up what they want their reality to be and never actually check if the hypothesis is true or not."
36-3-1-2-3-1,
36-3-1-2-4,nobody would go to that country because he put money into crypto. it's el salvador my dude.
36-3-1-2-5,"Use your brain and stop spreading false information: ""minuscule compared to their economy"".  1) Do you even understand basic economics?The GDP per capita of El Salvador is 4.408,52 USD. For comparison, the GDP per capita of US is 69.287,54 USD.  El Salvador is ranked very low in both GDP and life-standards. That idiot spend more than 5% of this yearly GDP for bitcoin that went into waste. Even if BTC would rise to 100k by the end of this year; use your brain and ask yourself, how many died for his BTC gamble?&#x200B;It's insane how people like you can defend this dictator manchild."
36-3-1-2-5-2,"They're a dolarized nation their options were limited from the beginning.If anything the BTC gamba was just a way to hide funds from the IMF, before their country gets roped into arbitration."
36-3-2,#BUY THE DIPBITCH I’VE BEEN BUYING FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS
36-3-2-1,The next halving isn't for 498 days.  There's plenty of time to keep buying dips.
36-3-2-1-1,"Time, yes.  Reasons, no."
36-3-2-1-1-1,You'll find plenty of reasons when back at ATH.
36-3-2-2,"And according to this, you have wasted money the. Entire. Time."
36-3-4,Because these articles ALWAYS randomly cherry-pick date ranges to suit their narrative.“Less volatility than $USD” (over a 51.26 day dataset …please don’t ask about day 52)
36-3-4-2,Maybe they also get moons for creating shit articles.
36-3-4-2-1,"They get moon farmers linking the articles here, which then gets them clicks and ad revenue.So yes; in a way moons are actually driving these articles to a small extent.…even though your comment was likely satirical!"
36-3-5,"It is because BTC maxis, including Saylor, keep telling the public you can’t lose money if you hold BTC for more than 4 years."
36-3-5-1,This is stupid of them to say.And if you bought Netflix in 2016 you were losing money during the huge crash this year.Long term is probably more than 10 years.
36-3-5-2,Oh yeah FTX failing has nothing to do with and I'm sure long term BTC will stay below $17K.
36-4,Whoa if you buy RIGHT NOW it’s like buying and holding since Dec 2017 LETS GOOOOOO!!
36-4-1,Just wait till we go back to 2012
36-4-1-1,FIRE SALE! Might actually be able to HOLD a full Bitcoin!
36-5,Very cool! Thanks for the reminder
36-5-1,Thanks for it so we can buy more at this point of time man.
37,"Bitcoin Bull, unveiled moments ago at Bitcoin conference Miami…. Bullish."
37-1,This looks like the Ten Commandments movie where everyone is worshiping a golden bull just before Moses comes down with the ten commandments and god strikes everyone with lightning.
37-1-1,"Yes...but it was a calf AFAIK, but i wasn't there sooo.."
37-2,its so fucking cool! I dont get why some of you dont like it.  I would buy a small one.
37-3,I think this looks sick idk why all the hate
37-3-1,"Maybe the fact that it's a direct copy of the Wall St. Bull?Maybe because the Bull was placed directly in the wake of the Black Monday Crash of 1987? Where global losses were almost $2,000,000,000,000? Do you know what happened to that money? It was pocketed by the elite, denied to the people, and bailed out to corporations by the government. Nobody on Wall Street ever experiences punishment for their crimes despite people dying or killing themselves for doing nothing wrong but being pawns in a financial game.Maybe also because it's a shitty design that can't handle outdoor weather like the Bull Can, and it will be discolored and dusted soon- unless they bring it inside at which point no normal person will ever see it again. So much for Bitcoin being about and for the people."
37-3-1-2,"The correct interpretation is that Bitcoin is the new bull economy, and it is much better than the old one. So the statue is the same basic shape, but is better and higher tech. It represents the new and technically advanced overtaking he old and corrupted. If you don't like that, then fine. But we should at least get at what it really represents before we dismiss it."
37-3-1-2-1,"You can’t say there is a correct interpretation lmao. People can interpret it however they want. If the bull is widely interpreted in a certain way by the public, then that is message it is sending, regardless of intent"
37-3-1-2-1-1,"Then why is your interpretation better than mine if there is no objectivity in intentional representation? Why does marketing work then? As you say, lmao."
37-3-1-2-1-1-1,"Mine is not better, but mine is just as valid. You said the correct interpretation. Im saying there is not a correct interpretation, there are simply interpretations. Marketing is not art. Marketing is trying to sell a product. This is a statue to represent an idea and it can be interpreted however people see it"
37-3-1-4,Jesus dude chill..it's just a bull decoration lol
37-3-1-4-2,"There is meaning behind art. It is worth discussing, if you dont like hearing the discussion you are free to not listen or interpret it in your own way as well."
37-3-1-5,"> Maybe the fact that it's a direct copy of the Wall St. Bull?The terms ""bear"" and ""bull"" for market movements date back to at least the 1700s, predating America.  Saying this is a direct copy of Wall St. is like saying a statue of MLK is a copy of a statue of Columbus, because both of them are ""people.""  The only thing this statue has in common with Wall St.'s statue is that they're both ""bulls."""
37-3-1-5-1,"I have no opinion on this, but yeah no it’s in the exact same pose as the charging bull on Wall Street, right down to the tail. Pretty clearly an homage of sorts."
37-4,Metal as fuck  just give him red laser eyes that burns and blinds passerby's and he's perfect (chef's kiss)
37-4-3,"Hopefully they don’t ruin it with another little girl statueEDIT: I cannot believe I actually have to put the /s on this comment. I’m referencing the wall street bull having a statue of a little girl in front of it, implying this Bitcoin bull is way cooler. My gosh."
38,Bitcoin at $33k...
38-1,You mean ~~$32k~~ ~~$31k~~ ~~$29k~~ $28k
38-1-1,"All the way down to $20k, yes please!"
38-1-1-1,Wishing for that sounds like a risky bet.
38-1-1-1-1,"Oh damn, that would really cause a collapse, which isn't unreasonable. This massive amount of upwards trajectory almost needs to be balanced by such an event. How low would Bitcoin go before you dropped everything into it? I think a lot of people answer that question with a number much higher than $0 so there will always be liquidity."
38-1-1-1-1-2,"They already have plenty of coin to meet the call, so it's a ""meh"" on that point imo. How he and the other big vocal newcomers with play it off socially is the spicy question for me right now."
38-1-1-1-1-2-1,It won't go past 30k relax.
38-1-1-1-1-2-1-2,Wanna bet? Im calling it this week to 27-25
38-1-1-1-1-4,"No it wont. If you read the article, its only a small  fraction of bitcoin that is collateralized in that loan which was like 5% of their holdings at that time. Bitcoin would have to go near zero for them to get liquidated."
38-1-1-2,Yeeeees preciousssss
38-1-1-2-1,"We gonna see a lot of downfall to buy, that's a good thing."
38-1-1-5,I'm cool with that. Ready to buy!
38-1-1-5-1,"Just like me, we should not think about the market that much, just buy."
38-1-5,The market has become more attractive!
38-2,When 64k oh no if only I bought it look at it now.Takes balls to do stuff in every business.
38-2-1,52% correction from ATH is a pretty big discount! Looks cheap to me #BTC
38-2-1-1,As long term investment for sure I agree.Shorters are going to get wrecked this time.
38-2-1-1-1,"The macro 618 is around 28/29k and the 786 around 18k, we ain’t done dumping. We might see a short term bounce here soon but don’t expect that to break 37."
38-2-1-1-1-1,You must be a billionaire with all that TA knowledge you have....you are a billionaire right?
38-2-1-2,The smart ones will keep stocking up as we go
38-3,I think it's the price of groceries keeping people away at the moment. This market doesn't give much confidence to investors.
38-3-1,Good point.  Groceries are up at least 20% so far this year.  Some folks are getting spooked.
38-5,"Lol I'm trying, but I'm broke as sh*t RN. I won't sell tho, HODL Squad."
38-5-1,If you sell it will just push it lower.  More bitcoin for me..
39,"Everyone was for decentralisation until Russia wanted to sell Gas for bitcoin, now people around this sub are crying about it with comments like ""I would rather lose money and the price tanks than Russia making money from Bitcoin""First of all, as someone from a third world country that's been sanctioned, all sanctions do is bring a famine to a country. (Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human."
39-1,The truth is that people in this sub are not representative of crypto. That's it.
39-1-1,"Also bitcoin or crypto doesnt give a shit as to what someone thinks of it. If someone thinks "" ""I would rather lose money and the price tanks than Russia making money from Bitcoin"", then they should just quit crypto as they never really understood it in the first placeBitcoin/crypto can help a Ukrainian person flee the war terror, while at the same time it can help russia evade sanctions. Its just money. That is the first lesson on crypto"
39-1-1-1,"Exactly this. Doesn't matter how much people hate Russia, Crypto is neutral and everyone can use it. People don't understand what decentralization exactly is."
39-1-1-1-1,We wanted decentralization and now we got it.
39-1-1-1-1-2,"Did we? The dream and what people used to say even just 5 years ago, let alone ten was that this would be adopted and used as a currency. So far it hasn't, it's treated as a volatile investment asset by most people in the world including people in this sub. (You can't claim that you think BTC is a good currency while at the same time be yelling ""buy the dip"" and ""BTC is going to moon"" to whatever ridiculous threshold you decided to choose. A volatile currency is just a bad currency and people will move and use something less volatile for trade.So this gets to the heart of the matter, if most people are unwilling to spend their bitcoin and most people are unwilling to accept it for goods or services then it is centralized by all the exchanges you need to actually convert it into something you can use in your country. Hopefully one day this comment will age like milk, but we are not close to that as I see it right now."
39-1-1-1-1-2-1,"You sir put into words what I was holding in for years, thank you. To all bitcoin maxis out there: you can't call this a proper decentralised currency and then 25x leverage long it, thats not how this fucking works. Imagine going to buy a TV with bitcoin and due to volatility you are funds are not enough midway. Sorry but as long as this volatatility continues and people treats this as a moonshot leverage trading asset this will never be a proper fiat replacement. A proper currency should be as stable as it can be while also being decentralised and privacy respecting. Btc will never replace fiat, some other coin probably will but btc aint the answer."
39-1-1-1-2,"Very true, it is extremely difficult to judge the cause and justice of a war from just government propaganda either side, they are in fact no big difference than a group of gangsters. Being politically neutral is like Switzerland or Sweden, the best a world wide currency should doSimilarly, privacy of transaction is very important, otherwise any powerful entity would be able to sanction any person that has a conflict of interest. This is especially important when people do transactions over different countries that have different political ideology"
39-1-1-1-4,"Well, it's normal to reflect and ask whether people actually want a decentralized system when there's no real way to prevent abuse from bad actors. Are the pros actually worth the cons? As we learn more about how this technology is used over time, we become better informed to answer this question."
39-1-1-4,"Without crypto - the Ukrainian can be helped, and Russia can be punished.The world is better without crypto"
39-1-2,"We only form about 3.5% of the entirety of crypto investors and that’s not accounting for the double accounts and inactive accounts.And then there’s also moons which encourages a hive mind and incentivises saying the popular opinion and there you go, perfect recipe for an echo chamber completely detached from real life."
39-1-2-1,"I dont come around here much lately because of that. It seems like everyone around here is either brand new to crypto or still in the mentality of a noob investor. Constant buy high sell low jokes, BTC is going to crash!, and general fuddery. When I first discovered this sub it was easy to get caught up in how many people it seemed think this way. Made bad trades which I never did till I came around here and got exposed to fud. Quit for about 8 months now and no dumb decisions have been made because I got drunk and read what idiots have to say at 3am."
39-1-2-1-1,I'm new here but I see what you mean. I've only ever made bad trades trying to time flips like I have any godly idea when the price is going to fluctuate. Spoiler: I don'tPicking coins I believe in and hodling has been 100% better for both my wallet and my perspective.
39-1-2-1-1-1,"Yeah the whole anonymous network is a double-edged sword with both real positives and terrible negatives. I rarely ever trade on telegram shit now, mainly opt for drops only, did do a net gain thank god tho"
39-1-5,"B-b-b-but Reddit is real life! And my trendies are a strict Trump free investment! Anything to do with Putin and his cronies is forbidden! Biden was great, now it's Kamalas turn! Let's go ladies, I'm feeling witchy today! Got a 10:30am client coming over for some light BDSM and foot worship, then a regular at 1pm. After I suck him off I'll be free to rule the day!"
39-2,"Bitcoin is fair, not altruistic"
39-2-1,Bitcoin doesn't discriminate so everyone is free to use it. People need to get over this already
39-2-1-1,"Precisely. People you dislike are going to use it. That's what being decentralised is.Already an improvement from banks who don't allow certain parts of the population from opening accounts cause their ""income"" isn't enough (happens way more in 3rd world countries)"
39-2-1-1-1,"And it’s a stupid take anyway, drug dealers and gangsters use the dollar for their dealings all the time yet no one blames the dollar for that."
39-2-1-1-2,It is especially helpful for folks that can now send money to their relatives across the world with possibly minimal fees.
39-2-1-1-2-1,Before I know what crypto is I used to send money abroad with western union which was charging with ridiculous amounts of fees. Then I learned about crypto and have never used western union since.
39-2-1-2,"Exactly, this is main idea behind decentralization. Noone can control it, and everyone can use it."
39-2-1-2-1,"No one can create more btc, no one can control it. No one can take it away from you and everyone can use it!"
39-2-1-2-1-3,"Sadly that is exactly why governments will do all they can to squash it .... just like they did to the MOVE members, Randy Weaver and his family , the Bundys, LaVoy Finnicum , the Branch Davidians and on a larger scale Libya and other nations who dared challenge their dominance. As a rule they generally destroy what they can’t control !!But they will also work tirelessly to create their own central bank digital currency "
39-2-2,"The best way of summing it up. Money is a tool, like a Hammer. Someone can use a Hammer to build a house or cave in someone's skull. In either case, the Hammer isn't responsible, the user is.Crypto just gives everyone a chance to get a Hammer."
39-2-2-2,"Nuclear weapons are a tool , anyone can use them therefore nuclear weapons are not responsible for killing millions it’s the person who triggers them .Technology empowers people, empowers people to good or bad ."
39-2-2-2-1,"Shit comparison, but you knew that when you posted it."
39-3,"Using ""everyone"" all the time is getting annoying. I don't think the majority fully understands what decentralisation actually is, the fact that Russia CAN use BTC to sell gas is extremely positive for the ecosystem."
39-3-2,"There will probably be worse things too, like terrorist DAOs. Just have to accept that decentralization means people you don't like can use the system too and hope they are dealt with externally."
39-3-3,How is it positive?
39-3-3-1,"I think they mean the fact that it can be used to avoid sanctions shows one of it's core strengths. I don't agree the result is positive, but the way it's achieved is ""good for Bitcoin"""
39-3-3-3,To have Putin be able to sell Russia's gas with Bitcoin is the entire point of crypto currency. If you don't think that's a positive think then why are you even on this sub?
39-3-3-3-2,"I personally don't call it a positive or a negative. I call it an inevitability. I just stand back and watch what happens, and I react (buy, sell, re-accumulate) as I see fit."
39-3-5,This topic really splits the community. OP just says everyone like all of us are against decentralization and bitcoin. It's the same ol' sensationalized post to get karma.
39-4,**Decentralization is neutral and don’t discriminate!**
39-4-1,"Crypto is neutral, anyone is free to use it."
39-4-1-1,"The idea behind decentralization approves this. It's not controlled, and everyone can use it."
39-4-1-2,"Crypto has innate bias and discrimination built in. Anyone with money, a computer, an internet connection, and access to a viable on-ramp is free to use it. Neutrality is a myth. It doesn't exist. There will always be discriminating factors for all things. How we recognize and handle that fact is much more enlightening than trying to insist something is ""neutral""."
39-4-3,"Exactly, the whole purpose of decentralisation is to not have the government control your finances, even if you’re in the wrong"
39-4-3-1,"It's pretty simple: If they can't control it, they'll ban it. If Russia uses Bitcoin to circumvent sanctions you'll see a counter reaction from the west. At the end of day everyone loses. So it's better to play by the rules."
39-4-3-1-1,You can't ban what you can't controlHow do you even ban bitcoin lolAll you need is a device that has access to internet
39-4-3-1-1-1,"You can't ban bitcoin transfers, but you can make it useless by making laws that forbids companies to accept it as payment or use it to pay russian oil/gas."
39-4-3-1-1-2,"You ban it by saying its illigal tender. Thats all. All youre talking about is bit coin being used for illigal activity, if it cant be used openly. Have fun funding drugs and kidnappings i guess, if youre going to limit its uses in that manner. Otherwise, you still have to play ball with goverments."
39-4-4,"The world's opinion might change, but the blockchain will always remain."
40,"Are we still early? Go ask randoms, take $100 or a Bitcoin?"
40-1,I like how they acknowledged bitcoin was worth 40k dollars and said the cash was better because it was real.
40-1-1,"WAIT 40,000 DOLLARS? What are we getting? STRAIGHT DOLLARS!"
40-1-1-1,Straight cash homie
40-1-1-1-1,Man Im glad Im married now because when I was single these fools were all over the bar. I mean I feel bad hooking up with something that stupid.
40-1-1-1-1-2,Imagine you impregnate her and you get a stupid child 
40-1-1-1-1-2-3,"Is there something wrong here with the reddit as i am seeing the multiple same comment spamming here, which i usually don't see here.May be some kind of delay and people keep clicking on the submit button."
40-1-1-1-1-5,"They were a good time, they weren't a good thing so don't feel bad. I mean, I never expected to find the right girl at a bar but I did expect to find the right girls to have a fun night with lol. At least they weren't entirely stupid because they didn't end up getting knocked up (Plan B does get expensive though )Nowadays, I stack Shatoshis instead of stacking up body count, my net worth would go down if I kept that trend going lol."
40-1-1-4,"Dollars are going down, Bitcoin is going down but the purchasing power of dollar is down and BTC is still in between, you can see mass adoption of BTC in future"
40-1-2,"Also ""I dont know what bitcoin is but it sounds like scam"""
40-1-2-1,"In their defense, if someone  explains Bitcoin to you in a minute ('so everybody prints their own money then sells it for more"") , you probably *should* think scam. It takes a little more research (while not drunk ideally) to understand the magnitude of it."
40-1-2-1-1,"Maybe, but scam or not, if I were offered a choice between something that someone else is willing to pay 40k for and 100 dollars? I'd take the bitcoin and sell it immediately for the free 40k. Special kind of dumbass to say no, especially in a theoretical question.This gives the same energy as people who don't understand that 100kg of feathers weighs the same as 100kg of bricks/rocks etc."
40-1-2-1-2,"To be honest, in terms of the history of CURRENCY, crypto-currency is so radically new in human history that this transition will and rightfully be very slow and skeptic as it's been many many many generations since we've transitioned to a new currency. I hope to stop using currency one day and just use money :)"
40-1-2-1-2-1,I still remember people being skeptical of banks. My parents used travelers checks on holidays and I remember I got a bank card to get fiat out of the ATM . My parents thought it was dodgy inc the high interest you would receive. They continued to get their Salary in cash until they were forced to use their bank account. As they now force us to use cashless. (Apps) So it’s not a huge step going from cashless to crypto IMO
40-1-2-1-2-1-1,"This is always what I think about when I hear people talking mad shit(usually uneducated mad shit) about bitcoin and other cryptos.Probably nobody in the history of humanity has been initially onboard with changing what currency is widely used. When we went from shells to precious metals or when we moved away from the bartering system or when we got rid of the gold standard or now how we’re getting rid of paper money, it’s all been the same. There’s a bunch of people who come out against it mostly because it is a new system, but it almost always improves the quality of transactions."
40-1-2-1-3,"Research is important but Calling anything scam without any research is also not a good thing, people should understand block chain technology first, then they should see crypto"
40-2,They seem hammered
40-2-4,"They’re obviously hammered and just fucking around with the interviewer for fun but everyone is treating this like they’re being serious.Come on guys, go out and have fun at a party in the real world once in a while. And when the girls talk to you and they’re joking around please don’t start lecturing them on Bitcoin "
40-2-5,"Pretty sure no matter how hammered I was, I would take the Bitcoin."
40-3,I have made many of the right decisions in my life. Thank you ladies for confirming :)
40-3-2,"What right decisions? Staying single ? There is nothing wrong with staying single btw, just seems odd to use this video to justify that when we all know that not all women are like those two. Besides those two seem to be in their early 20s, who wasn't dumb in their early 20s?"
40-3-2-4,I have multiple women. Is that fine too?In a way I'm helping guys that want to stay single by keeping women potentially interested in them off the market. :)There will only ever be 21 million women.
40-4,"Damn, this made me feel better about myself, a lot."
40-4-1,"Why did this make you feel better about yourself?Most of the world still doesn’t invest in Bitcoin or crypto currencies. These girls are the majority. And even now crypto as a mainstream currency is only really just a concept. Not trying to be argumentative, but these girls are probably better off than the thousands of people who have done nothing but lose money on cryptocurrency."
40-4-1-2,"They’re literally not losing money in this case, they’re being asked which they’d rather be given. Bitcoin is equal to around $40k in this video, that means these girls traded a chance at $40k for $100 physical cash, because they don’t understand the concept of things having cash value themselves."
40-4-1-2-1,"Or because they don't know what it would entail to turn that Bitcoin into dollars.  If my thought is already ""I don't know what Bitcoin is but it sounds like a scam"", I'd probably be averse to taking on the risk of getting scammed out of something ostensibly worth $40k, whereas the $100 is a more sure bet.  I probably wouldn't know which wallet to use, or which exchanges are trustworthy, or why it's a bad idea to give someone my seed phrase - but I would know that $100 is $100."
40-4-1-2-1-2,Understandable to an extent but if I have a choice between something worth 40k and 100 bucks even if I know nothing about it and figure it will be a huge pain in the butt I’ll also assume I can take the easy way and sell it to someone cheap who can deal with the hassle. I mean I don’t use coke but if you offered me 40k worth of coke or 100 bucks I’d take the coke and ask my friends if anyone knew anyone I might only get like 10k for it but even at that discount I’m hella better than 100 bucks.
40-4-1-3,"They fall in same boat because investing without research in crypto always gives you loss, so if you are not researching and still investing then it's better you don't know about crypto atleast you can save your Money"
40-4-1-5,"I think he means more like; as a person or intellectually than financially.Financially, going to a bar in a tight dress and a thong to get cummed in by the first guy with a nice house is a very easy way to make 500k. Morally its not exactly the peak of philosophy.Honestly I'm with him just hearing drunken bar people talk is enough to make me want to leave a club these days.*flash backs to me having three beer and then seeing some dude yell ""White claw!"" as he jumped into a moving car*Fuck the phonies at the club."
40-5,Everyone commenting about how terrible women are in here as if he probably didn’t ask 500 women before this and just clipped this response lol
40-5-1,"Also, these girls look like they're maaaaaybe 18. How many teenagers in general would know this? And they're in the middle of partying, not economics class. Lol. We can only learn when we know better."
40-5-1-2,If they paid attention in economics class they'd probably still pick the cash. When I took economics they taught the typical Keyensian bullshit that we all know is capitalist propaganda.
40-5-1-4,"Um first of all they don’t look 18, and they literally say their ages at the start of the video ""22 and 23”.. and clearly they’re old enough to get drunk at a club lolLove that I’m being downvoted for pointing out that they stated their actual ages in the video."
40-5-4,"Every person we've asked gave us the sensible response, but we still want to show people are stupid and we are smart. I know, let's go ask drunk teenagers in the middle of the night!"
41,This right now is peak crypto-fear. If you are still sticking to Crypto you are truly a holder and you can go through the worst bear markets.Bitcoin just made its wickets below 28 and even further down to 25k. Luna is basically going down in a literally straight line and achieved 1$ before even UST. We got over a billion long liquidations.
41-2,Things were worse in 2018.  ETH went from $1400 all the way down to $56.2018 taught me to take profits.
41-2-1,"Finally, actual investing advice. Not sure why holding so popular in crypto."
41-2-1-1,Because most people aren't good enough to take profits at the right time and they get fomo. Trading is hard. Holding and buying heavier on dips is a lot easier.
41-2-1-1-1,I'd love to take profit but the problem is no matter how high it goes I always think it's going higher so sit tight.How can anyone know what 'the right time' is when we only have what is happening now and what happened yesterday to go on?I'd love to know your approach if you are willing to share.
41-2-1-1-1-1,Take profits if the money is gonna help your life in a very positive way. Thats why you need money afterall.
41-2-1-1-1-1-1,This. I took my profits to pay for a move and later to pay for a new PC. no regretsWins are ONLY wins when they are realized. Crypto is no different from other investments in this regard.
41-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,Currently I have similar invest and hold enough that in a some years  I reach my down payment target  for a house mortgage I hope Iam able to achieve that
41-2-1-1-1-5,"You're thinking about it backwards. That profit that you're letting sit is money you could be using for new investments. By letting it sit there you're missing out on opportunities and most likely it's going to go down before it hits what ever ""high"" you were hoping for. This goes double for hype coins with shit tech and no future. You should never leave your money in 90% of cryptos"
41-2-1-1-5,"Problem with crypto, it's not always ""a dip"".I have plenty of coins from 2017 that did not DIP but outright DIED. So do not think a hot coin today dropping is like buying the dip when the google stock dropps. Some coins that were popular this bull run will simply be gone.I bought the dip of waltoncoin, modum, whatever they all were called back then."
41-2-1-2,"Because someone has to provide exit liquidity for others to take profits, and there's a lot of what I'll politely call unscrupulous people in this space that find it useful to promote that idea."
41-2-1-4,Because they treat it like an ideological crusade rather than an investment. They hold it and refuse to sell out of principle rather than cut their losses like a sane human and reinvest when they see a path to profit.
41-2-2,"2018 told me I don't have a fucking clue what I'm doing or when to do it. But I did learn don't go heavy on shitcoins or altcoins. even ETH is a altcoin. I'm like 75% BTC his time round as opposed to 0% BTC in 2018. I'm cool, I can hold throughout this."
41-2-2-2,I have learnt that I don’t have a fucking clue what I’m doing every single year of life since I turned 18.Here’s the most scary part….NO ONE HAS A FUCKING CLUE. Not just about Crypto but about everything.We’re living in a “post expertise” world.
41-3,Im still here because i got place nowhere else to go
41-3-3,I'll be honest I haven't payed attention to my portfolio in months. I've had 0 fiat and haven't invested at all. Everything I have is staked so I guess I'll see you guys in like 6 months when it's at ATH?
41-3-3-1,6 months is very optimistic imo
41-3-3-1-1,Yeah i bet we won't see another bull market for at least 1-4 years
41-3-3-1-1-1,I’m ok with that:)) I’m going to buy a heavenly tone of crypto between now and then
41-3-3-1-1-1-1,I'm with you there. History repeats itself after all 
41-3-3-1-1-1-1-1,BTC will definitely touch 100k in next bull cycle
41-3-3-1-1-1-1-2,"I consider myself „new“ in crypto, only started following it in the run up of 2017/2018. BTC hitting 20k was nuts back then. Now it doesn’t even touch 20k when dumping „historically“.I can‘t wait for the future man. The next „historic dump“ will be from 150k to 60k.The time to buy (DCA) is now. Buy solid projects who will improve even in winter and you will make so much money in the next bullrun."
41-3-3-1-1-1-2,This is the way 
41-3-3-1-1-3,Halving in 2024 is probably where the next one starts again.
41-3-3-1-1-5,So... About the time that senile old crook leaves the Whitehouse?  Sounds about right lol
41-3-3-1-1-5-1," Let's hope, he's there to serve the interest of the federal reserve. And the last thing they want is the mass adoption of decentralized, unregulated currency aka crypto."
41-3-3-1-2,Like I said. I forgot about crypto all together. I went back to school and have been studying finance. I just zoned out about crypto tbh. And it's been great. I'll probably set up a dca strategy throughout the summer since I only have 2 finals left and can start working more now and get some fiat to invest
41-3-3-1-2-1,"I did the same, just DCA'd for the first time in months at the lower prices today. Been in school advancing my nursing degree and made a 4.0 not watching jack shit on YouTube. Helps to focus on goals and eventually the money will work for us."
41-3-3-1-2-1-1,Wow congrats. I think I did fail my finance exam so I'll have to retake it during the fall. But the psychology exam I took today went alot better. I only struggled with 1 question and managed to bullshit around it. I've got my math exam and my statistics exam left. And after that I plan to get very drunk. Hit up some bbqs throughout the summer and just be a lazy piece of shit
41-4,Having only a minor portion of assets in crypto helps keep me focused on what’s important. Like my stocks being down 50%
41-4-3,"Weirdly the fact that the entire global financial system is melting down makes me less worried about crypto in particular. It’s not like anything fundamentally changed, when we make it through the other side it’ll come back."
41-4-3-3,"Fundamentally crypto, like NFTs, are a greater fool scam. You need to hope that on the ""other side"" there is a greater fool to prop up the price for you so you can exit your position. Otherwise it isn't just bleeding, it is bleed out."
41-4-3-3-1,"You are thinking about it all wrong. The cryptography isn’t the asset, the cryptography secures the asset. Now apply that concept to literally anything that can be digitalized. NFTs are just a way of proving that the specific tokenized asset is non-fungible or in other words unique. That is all it is. A simple and super useful tool that will be everywhere eventually. Fundamentally, the stock market works the same way you explained crypto, except it doesn’t have the same security or consensus mechanisms to decentralize the market. So you are left with an unsecured market, that is controlled by a central entity, in other words a recipe for disaster."
41-4-3-3-1-1,See everything you say sounds like it means something. But Apple is a company. Sony is a company. Stocks are backed by fundamental of that company. Not funny money like crypto. Talk to me about how legit Luna Terra is. Explain how that isn't just funny money that lost its shine so people rush out of the market because they didn't want to be the biggest idiot left holding billions in worthless crypto. It's your money. Do whatever you want with it. Just remember you are not important enough to be bailed out when these scams eventually all fail.
41-4-5,Just wait for your house to fall in value too. That's a really butt puckering experience
41-4-5-1,You guys have houses??
41-4-5-1-1,Not for long :(
41-4-5-1-1-1,"If you own a house then it doesn't matter if it drops in value because you still have the house to live in.Same with cryptocurrency or any other investment. As long as it doesn't cease to exist, you still have it for the future."
41-4-5-1-1-1-1,"I mean, not if it gets foreclosed on because the equity is out of wack, or you can't afford the higher interest payments, or any number of things.But yeah, you're right, it never matters if an asset one owns falls in price. Tell that to all the people holding Luna. At least they still have their UST right?"
41-5,It helps when you’re still above what you bought in at. Eth is the only thing keeping me afloat right now though.
41-5-1,Same here. Bought eth real low but half of those gains I put into other coins which have ruined it for me
41-5-1-1,"yikes, sorry to hear thatAt this point I will literally only buy ETH and nothing else. If I make gains off shitcoins I move them into ETH"
41-5-1-1-1,"It’s all good, I’m in this long term. I’m probably gonna stick to just buying eth now too. Start dcaing over this bear market. edit didn’t realize you replied to the other guy lol"
41-5-1-2,"Sorry to hear that man, all we can do is just wait a year or two for the next bull market. Thankfully I didn’t venture into too many other projects, just link and ada. It’s crazy links below what I bought it at almost 2 years ago"
42,"A record 55,000 Bitcoin, or over $1.1 billion, was just withdrawn from Binance"
42-1,"Whether it be an individual or an institution, who the fuck keeps 55,000 BTC on an exchange? Binance is the only answer that makes sense to me."
42-1-1,Maybe he joined this sub and he/she realized that it’s not his/her keys so not his crypto **Good job boys and girls!**
42-1-1-1,"Nah that can't be right, no one on this sub actually has a stack of BTC worth any meaningful amount, right?"
42-1-1-1-1,My stack is meaningful to me! :|
42-1-1-3,"Teaching holders, one person at a time."
42-1-1-3-1,"Wait, so it's not my crypto if I keep it in an exchange? Brb, I'll go transfer out my $2 worth of Bitcoin."
42-1-1-3-1-1,got free from Coinbase Earn not doubt ...
42-1-3,I was waiting for my ledger to arrive…
42-1-3-1,This is concerning.Many investors follow the movements of whales to determine when to buy/sell. If this whale is moving BTC out of storage then they're likely looking to sell.Our current market uptrend may be short lived. Should have listened to that user that called it out as a bull trap.
42-1-4,Psychopaths
42-3,Meanwhile people are nervous about keeping $100 on an exchange

42-4,"... but could you just imagine - the paranoia, when you've copy/pasted that address.... and you're just about to sign the transaction ...and breeeeathe !"
42-4-1,Imagine the relief when it finally appears at the other end...
42-4-1-1,Imagine when it doesn't 
42-4-1-1-4,I would delete my life
42-4-1-1-4-1,"how do you do that? how can you 'delete' your life?can you caps lock your life too? or Return your life, Escape your life, number lock your life... even maybe you can backspace your life, Enter your life or print screen your life"
42-4-1-3,"Like taking the biggest shit after waiting for an hour. Trust me, very few instances of  relief come closer."
42-4-2,"There's NO way I'd do it one transaction.  I'd do a test transaction, then send it in increments, fuck those petty fees at that point. I'd do 55 transaction of 1000 BTC each and still be stressed out EVERY single time."
42-4-2-2,"I understand the logic there for sure and would probably do the same. But doesn’t more transactions mean more actions, which translates to higher probability of making a mistake? Versus doing the transaction once but have multiple eyes all check the address involved to ensure correctness?"
42-4-2-2-1,I’d add the address to the address book and do a small transaction. I’d then use the address book entry to do the additional transactions.I’d still check the address a million times when doing it though…I make regular transactions from Binance to kraken and the kraken address is stored in the address book. I still check kraken before any large transactions to make sure my address hasn’t been cycled for whatever reason… The pros do outweigh the cons on the blockchain but they sure do add a level of stress.
42-4-2-3,"Your competly right. Only time I ever cashed something out, close to 15k. I made so may ttansacrions to send it to exchange, and even from exchange to my bank account I made 20 transactions... I shit my pants every time I clicked confirm and waiting for confirmation."
42-4-2-3-1,"Seriously.. I move even a couple hundred and I'm refreshing, in a panic. Even after I do the test transfer.  I just always feel like I'm gonna mess it up"
42-5,Kanye really did it bois
42-5-1,No one man should have all that *bitcoin*

43,"Bitcoin drops to $35.5K as 1,000 point Dow correction marks the worst trading day since 2020"
43-1,Worst trading YET*
43-1-5,But there is more
43-2,"The best thing is, our failed investment will forever be written in the   blockchain. Archeologists will be like ""haha, look at this fool, bought   at 45k lmfao""."
43-2-1,45k? Loook at this low baller. I bought in at 69k
43-2-2,"trades are not really archived on the blockchain.They are done on markets which are mainly centralized in exchanges and not public.""Someone moved x amount of coins from an exchange to a real wallet while the Price was high"" doesn't have the same ring to it."
43-2-2-2,Dex would like to have a word with you
43-2-2-2-1,"sure. DeFi Exists and all... but what percentage of the market is traded through DEXs?Binance alone does 25% of all trades. Next big exchanges are in the 3-4% range.But if you have a site that shows orderbooks of exchanges public, I'd love a link."
43-2-2-2-1-1,Just cause I put something in the orderbook doesn't make it a trade. It still has to execute and by that logic you'd have to count every day funds that are in the liquidity pool's for dexs are volume which would make dexs far more in volume.
43-2-2-2-1-1-1,"The argument was that trades are public, which they are not.You cannot see who bought something at what price. But for the 3rd time... if anyone has a link that shows the actually executed trades on any exchange public, I'd love to see it. I'm not aware of a single exchange that gives access to that data."
43-2-2-2-1-1-1-1,what are you talking about? if your talking about the executed trades of any CEX just look at the orderfeed and confirm it with the orderbook. theres also tools like  &  which plug into the API the exchanges provide.
43-2-2-3,"This is highly incorrect lol, every cex and dex logs trades"
43-2-2-3-1,"They log it... they just don't have public lists.but if you have links to public lists of CEXs, please share.Your bank also knows who wired what amount of money... does not mean the public has access to those records."
43-2-4,"10 years from now they'll say 1 of 2 things.1 - ""damn, look at this dude. He bought it cheap when ut was srill at 45 k.Or 2 - ""damn.  Look at this fool.  He bought at 45 k.  Then sold at a loss.  Then bought again at 60k.""Play the long game over years and you'll be fine."
43-2-4-1,"Or 3 - ""damn, look at these idiots who didn't sell before it went to zero.(not saying I believe it's likely going to zero, but there is a very small possibility)"
43-2-4-1-1,"Any coin outside the top two could theoretically go to zero, in my opinion, but if BTC & ETH do, we have way bigger problems. They are so ingrained in the global economy, that them retaining at least some value is almost assured, as long as the blockchain itself doesn’t fail."
43-3,"tldr; Bitcoin price fell to a 10-week low of $35,571 on Binance on May 5 as the Dow Jones saw a 1,063 point drop and Bitcoin price fell below $37,500 for the first time since November. The drop in the price coincided with a sell-off in the tech sector, which escalated into the close of the traditional markets.*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

51,Future is here #Bitcoin
51-1,You can't stop my node from verifying it
51-1-1,"Sure they can. The Feds are perfectly capable of removing your ability to connect to the internet.Edit: Downvote me all you want. What I said is factually correct whether you like it or not. Don’t pretend Bitcoin is completely beyond the reach of government manipulation for the individual. They can’t take your coins from you, but they can stop you participating."
51-1-1-1,"Technically speaking, this is 50% correct.However, due to the **unique** level of decentralisation achieved by the BTC network, it would not be viable/feasible to apprehend every single operator's node.Further, if the above **somehow became** true, they'd only be able to do so with public nodes. There is a vast portion of operators operating within the TOR network, I2P network, and others. Further, it becomes trivial to hide the traffic by changing the TCP Port, and tunnelling it over different protocols too."
51-1-1-2,My node is located in another country via VPN + TOR. Good luck shutting it down  
51-1-1-2-1,"It's funny the amount of people who are ignorant of TOR and VPN. If it was possible to shut down Bitcoin then they'd be able to shut down Torrenting piracy, but they can't. They even sent the founders of The Pirate Bay to prison, but yet the website Is still up and running till this day. Government can't stop something that's decentralized. I swear people who FUD Bitcoin are genuinely retarded."
51-1-1-2-1-3,The state already controls BTC.  Grow up.  It will NEVER serve as money.  Nor wages.  Not FUD.  Just economic reality.  BTC is an abstraction and nothing more.  Something for idiots to never stfu about at parties
51-1-1-2-3,"Would love to here more about adding layers of anonymity to my node. I considered vpn, but not sure how that would interface with my network. Obviously new, but know enough to care and be curious."
51-1-1-2-5,Is a node the same thing as a miner? Isn't it not profitable to have a node at a certain btc price?
51-1-1-2-5-1,"By ""node"" he/she probably meant Full-node. Not the same as a Miner or Mining-node. Mining-nodes add blocks to the blockchain and get paid for it, while the Full-nodes only verify the work done by the Mining-nodes.I'm no expert at this, but I reckon that the profitability of a mining-node is a complicated function of BTC:Fiat rate, electricity cost in the region, age and price of the mining rig, real-estate costs, overheads, among probably a few other things."

51-2,"Thats great if I want to transfer 90 million. If I wanna buy a candy bar, that 0.39 is massive. The vast majority of transfers using the SWIFT bank system are under 5 euros. That tiny transaction fee is suddenly 10%!!Edit: everyone saying ""lightning network!"" - how much does it cost to add $5 to my ln wallet? I still have to pay the transaction fee."
51-2-3,Lightning network solves that problem. On chain transactions fees are fixed. On LN they are proportional to the amount sent.
51-2-3-1,No it doesnt because you have to pay the fee to open and close a channel.*edit*Just reread you comment. The on chain fees are not fixed. They are what ever is needed to get the transaction included in the block in time frame acceptable to you.
51-2-3-1-2,"Can you forego the blockchain entirely, and only use LN?"
51-2-3-1-2-1,"Nope. at some point, you or some one else has to pay an on chain fee for an on chain transaction to either open or close a channel. Otherwise 'your' coins would just indefinatly be in lightning limbo. Which doesnt really solve any problem at all imo. The on chain tx fee needed will be determined by the miners, it might be very low, it might be very high. Depends on demand at the time you want to open or close the channel."
51-2-3-1-2-1-1,"> Otherwise 'your' coins would just indefinatly be in lightning limbo.Is the problem that you can't write to blockchain because you can't pay the on-chain fee, in case the other party commits an earlier state (i.e. before paying you?)"
51-2-3-1-2-1-1-1,"Its a potential problem. If the on chain fees are high enough at the time you want your coins back. Your option are pay high fee, or leave channel open."
51-2-3-2,"lol why yall discussing this stuff? If crypto where in any way viable it would have been adopted alpng time ago, but to no ones surprise it hasnt been adopted"
51-2-3-2-1,">lol why yall discussing this stuff? If crypto where in any way viable it would have been adopted alpng time ago, but to no ones surprise it hasnt been adoptedBitcoin is undertaking the fastest monetization process history has ever seen. Two sovereign nations on two different continents already use it as legal tender. Gold took decades and decades, almost a whole century, for it to become a global monetary standard. It is clear that bitcoin is going to achieve this much faster."
51-2-5,"Yes, because let's use the settlement layer where we literally bid for block space for micro-transacting /s4 years later, and there are still people that rather than question, basically state the inexistence of the Lightning Network."
51-2-5-1,"Dude it took Bitcoin 10 years to reach 1% global adoption (and still, the word ""adoption"" here is debatable, because most people using Bitcoin are still speculators). You can't expect a layer 2 built on top of Bitcoin to become mainstream in half the time."
51-2-5-1-2,>it took Bitcoin 10 years to reach 1% global adoption Insanely fast and almost unbelievable level of progress for an open source decentralized monetary network / currency. All from a single point of origin too. The trajectory and development of this network is incomprehensible. Hold on hodlers.

51-4-2,Those people use Swiss banks.
51-4-2-3,Most definitely don’t lol.  This isn’t the 70s
51-4-2-3-1,"&#x200B;You are very much are OOTL&#x200B;Even El Chapo, the largest drug trafficker in the world, used banks."
51-4-2-3-1-1,Interesting.  Seems all those guys had legit streams of income though no?  I know first hand how hard it is to get a Swiss bank account as an American in a high volatility field.
51-4-5,"So? The beauty about bitcoin is that it does not matter. All you need is the sender and receiver of the money to agree on something, and nobody else can tell them what is right or wrong."
51-4-5-1,Yk I’d rather prefer drug cartels aren’t be funded but you do you
51-4-5-1-1,"I'm not funding drug cartels either, and that is not the point. I rather have no central authority overseeing all financial transactions from anybody. It's not like drug cartels had a hard time gathering money before bitcoin (or cryptocurrency) existed. Just because something makes it easier to commit crime, does not mean it gets a net benefit to society. Your argument is almost similar as ""human trafficker's use cars, let's get rid of cars and solve human trafficking""."
51-4-5-1-1-1,"Their argument is nothing like that. Crypto would be similar to unchecked travel in your hypothetical ie no passport checks, no security. Money laundering and crime is harder in the traditional banking system but obviously not impossible. Crypto for criminals is trivial though.I'm guessing you aren't full in on keeping up with fraud in the world but guess what - instead of fraudsters moving money to mule account and then out of the country it now just goes straight into crypto and then they are done.The idea that crypto isn't a huge fraud risk in the world is ridiculous. People acting like they are the only people that matter and forgetting that vulnerable people need certain protections in place. I don't want regulation and protection for drug cartels, they always find a way. I want exchanges to put in more anti fraud and money laundering systems so that it just isn't as easy as account opened one day all money transferred in then moved to a fraudsters wallet."
51-4-5-1-1-1-1,"And I prefer nobody else being able what I can do with my money except me. I'm not in favor of drug cartels, I am in favor of freedom. Free travel would be nice too, you're right. Enforcement of criminal actions also needs to happen."
51-5,That's solved my everyday  problem.
59,Bitcoin to be accepted by McDonald's and Walmart via Lightning Network |
59-1,"Seeing a lot of misunderstanding on this one, so let me lay it down... the bullish thing about this announcement is NOT that merchants are starting to accept crypto as payment, its that the Bitcoin NETWORK can now be used as a payment rail in the same way as Visa. The difference is that settlement is done instantly and for almost free compared to Visa's 3% fee.You DONT have to spend your Bitcoin.You can pay in fiat, it gets converted automatically into Btc, sent over the bitcoin network to the merchants bank and converted back into fiat. It all happens instantly and for free, so Btc price volatility is irrelevant.$ to ₿ - - - - - - - -lightning - - - - - - - > ₿ to $"
59-1-1,"Correct, so many news articles are completely missing this too!It rightly has done nothing to the btc price because it’s a non event, it is however a significant win for the use case of blockchain in the real world which will do nothing but underpin it’s importance to the future."
59-1-1-1,"It’s almost more bullish this way. A lot of companies are accepting crypto payments just for the hell of it and to jump on the hype train. This instead is a much more sensible and technical approach to crypto. If one company reaps the benefit in this approach, a lot more will follow"
59-1-1-1-1,"I agree. Ive been listening to this decentralized vs. Centralized debate too long. Not everything can be 100% accurate to satoshis prophecy.. At the end of the day, our world is highly centralized, and industries will adopt what works and is easiest to build and maintain. Fitting into existing infrastructure is difficult with new technology and Strike seems to have done a pretty seamless job at integrating BTC payments in everyday life.As much as I value my privacy and freedom, I really do not see megacorps of the world caring a whole lot about decentralization, definitely not when it makes everything more complex and puts obstacle after obstacle in the path. And imo, most bitcoin holders really just want to see something that allows them to buy groceries over the network!"
59-1-1-1-1-1,"You’re correct generally big corporations don’t care about centralization, it’s much more about the bottom line. This move can increase the bottom line by nearly 3% while not introducing a large complication of crypto related tax issues."
59-1-1-1-2,"But that’s just it, this isn’t about accepting crypto at all. No merchant has to accept Bitcoin as their receiving currency to use this, nore should they, auditing/reporting would be a nightmare. Therefore this isn’t any retailer “accepting crypto”, it’s an app that will accept bitcoin or any fiat at one end, and spit out the merchants preferred payment (fiat) out the other. Therefore it’s not a crypto transaction, it’s an exchange that uses crypto tech, very different."
59-1-1-4,Not true. I listened to the announcement. You can pay in Bitcoin. It is just that the merchant receives dollars. It is actually bullish to be able to spend btc
59-1-1-5,"for the consumer its a good event if they can save on fees..but will they even know it was the bitcoin network that saved them the fees? maybe the incentive structure of bitcoin will eventually allow them to know cuz likely the heads of wall and mcd are now holding bitcoin so likely they will start to cheer for it too..so maybe a little pop up that says, thanks to satoshi you have saved 3% on fees))"
59-1-2,"This. As a small business I spend on average 3.2% in cc fees. I pay 80-90k per year to our cc processor.If I can use the lightning network in the future this represents a large chunk of capital I can reinvest into employees, equipment or my own retirement instead of lining the multi-billion dollar banking industry."
59-1-2-1,You are exactly the sort of demographic that this announcement was aimed at. I dont think most people have cottoned on to how big this news is for small businesses. My local corner shop has a minimum spend on using visa debit cards because they're getting so screwed on fees. Lightning could put an end to all this.
59-1-2-1-1,I can't imagine a single person that goes to my local corner shop using crypto tho. Especially btc which is fuck awful for payment.
59-1-2-2,"I second this. I’m a small business owner as well. I’m roughly $60k a year in merchant fees. If I didn’t have that extra $60k a year to pay out I could offer my staff more for an hourly wage, purchase equipment to offer new/different services and take more income home for my family and I. It would improve everyone’s lives overall."
59-1-2-3,"PLEASE remember, in the short term to achieve this, you’ll need to incentivise your customers to use this payment method by offering a discount similar to your original card fee, otherwise why would they pay using strike over their card? Your fee isn’t their issue, or even something they’re likely aware of, they just see the price of goods, and pay for it. Get your customers converted to this payment method, only then will you see the gain."
59-1-2-4,"why not use Nano, which is free to transact, secure, decentralised and doesn’t waste energy like BTC does"
59-1-2-4-1,Nano got absolutely murdered by spam last year. That’s why not nano. Needs to be a dependable network.
59-1-2-4-1-1,"How is this still a talking point? Yes the spam attack last year shifted some nodes out of sync which slowed down the network, but the devs released an update a few weeks later which solved the issue.That same type of dust spam attack would not affect the network if it was attempted now.In addition to that spam mitigation the devs are working on more unique spam resistance for future versions."
59-1-3,>$ to ₿ - - - - - - - -lightning - - - - - - - > ₿ to $You should start a text based crypto education channel. Never seen something explained so succinctlyEdit: Text based
59-1-4,"> You can pay in fiat, it gets converted automatically into Btc, sent over the bitcoin network to the merchants bank and converted back into fiatBut how does that work? Thats strike doing the conversion? Is there a liquidity pool? AFAIK and what I got from JMs speech was that strike is offering those ability to pay via their app. Utilizing the lightning network. So I assume strike will be handling all of the lightning channels and set up the nodes with their partners. Therefore there has to be a business case?"
59-1-4-1,"From what I can tell, Strike handles the conversion of fiat to Btc at the consumer end, and then once its zipped over to the merchants end via lightning, its converted back into  fiat at which point the payment is actually settled (as opposed to the 3 day lead time with visa).Neither user or merchant has to interact with Btc at all, but the merchant just saved 3% on Visa costs.From a users point of view, you use Strike as a payment app (the same way as Revolut, Cashapp or Paypal) by topping it up with fiat, and at that point its the same payment experience as using a visa checkout (tap, barcode, whatever).Lightning has its own liquidity pool (Lightning Pool) as its an L2 on top of the bitcoin main chain."
59-1-4-1-2,Doesn't Strike need to charge at least a bit of fees to stay in business? Lower than 3% of course but it can't be 0 right
59-1-4-1-2-1,They would charge the lightning fees which are handled by their Lightning nodes. They have minimum overheads so can afford to charge super low fees.
59-1-4-1-2-1-1,"Oh interesting, how low would they be?"
59-1-4-2,And why would I choose to pay that way? Its a debit card with extra steps.
59-1-4-2-1,"Agree, there is no incentive for the customer to use it as it stands because its an extra step to add funds to a 3rd party wallet. Only merchants will see the benefits.This could however open the door to incentivising the merchant to pass on some savings to the customer if they use Lightning to pay for their goods?Alternatively, if banks/Google Pay/Apple start rolling this out on their own payment systems, then it removes the extra step for the customer and it just becomes the default payment network."
59-1-4-2-1-1,"> This could however open the door to incentivising the merchant to pass on some savings to the customer if they use Lightning to pay for their goods?Could it? Do you get a cash discount for using cash at mcdonalds? When cash is instantly accepted everywhere, has no fees, and no need for currency conversion with spread you're bleeding out on."
59-1-4-2-1-1-1,"You probably get a slight discount in the price of goods as cash would be calculated into a merchants turnover.If Visa accounted for 100% of transactions in a store, I imagine they would raise their prices slightly to cover the extra cost of visa fees."
59-1-4-3,"idk about strike, but with coinbase card on my apple wallet, you can apparently pay with crypto. You can select which crypto you would like to use as payment to “*wow you’re friends that you’re paying in crypto*” -actual quote it says when setting up your card"
59-1-4-4,"May be wrong, but BTC multi sig scripting via lightning network takes care of everything needed in the middle (aside from the initial and ending conversions from and to fiat) I would assume strike has built a smart contract tool or proprietary software that allows for on the fly conversions from fiat to btc before and after the lightning network does its part. I don't think there's a treasury of strike owned btc involved in this,  again could be wrong.. very cool and a vital piece of the grand puzzle regardless!"
59-2,">Jack Mallers of Strike announced in Miami that Bitcoin will be available via the Lightning Network to over 400,000 storefronts and all US Shopify sites.>During the presentation, a slide appeared listing some of the biggest retailers in America, including McDonald’s, Walmart, Home Depot, and Best Buy. According to their websites, Blackhawk and NCR also serve Starbucks, Chipotle, El Corte Ingles, Lowe’s, Staples, Woolworths, and thousands of other global retailers.Am I dreaming?"
59-2-1,All Shopify sites accepting bitcoin is huge
59-2-2,my dream of buying a double quarter pounder with BTC is finally close to becoming a reality
59-2-2-1,Bit Mac
59-2-2-1-3,"Bullish fries with BitMac only for 0,00005 BTC!"
59-2-2-2,I want a BLT with BTC
59-2-3,"1. This directly affects my business and I will be taking as many BTC pmts as I can with this. Coinbase Commerce has been a nightmare trying to get the previous crypto pmts out. They wanted more documentation of the business than existed to run it legally and then a month to analyze them. 2. There’s a way to do this with a decentralized wallet. Research before you talk about how this is centralized. It can be decentralized for you while being centralized for the merchant. 3. This is huge news if they are serious, despite the terrible presentation of it.Edit: 1.75 million different merchants sell on Shopify to put it in perspective."
59-3,Suprised BTC didn’t give a candle at all Wonder if this was already well known
59-3-2,"It's just through the Strike app. Not like these retail stores are directly supporting crypto.Besides, spending BTC isn't going to drive up prices."
59-3-4,McDonalds and Walmart shoppers are the poorest demographic in the world. Why would they care about this? Nobody at Walmart is speculating on Bitcoin… McDouble with Bitcoin? That’s ridiculous
59-3-4-1,The poorest demographic often are the unbanked demographic…
59-3-4-1-1,Good luck buying btc without a bank
59-3-4-1-1-1,There's a Bitcoin ATM in every single liquor store around me in a 5 mi radius...
59-3-4-1-2,Yeah let me just go buy some Bitcoin with cash. Does Coinbase take cash?
59-3-4-1-2-2,Literally hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin ATMs exist...
59-3-4-1-2-2-1,"Right, not to mention there are lots of things to trade for bitcoin besides cash. And it’s enabling families separated in different countries to send money without giving 30% to a third party."
59-3-4-2,">According to financial site Millionaire Corner, one in three people with a net worth of more than $5 million shops at Walmart on a regular basis. More than 40% of multimillionaires shop at Target and nearly half can be found in the aisles of Costco stores."
59-3-4-5,"The price of btc jumped like $2k in a matter of minutes last year when there was just a tweet that walmart would be accepted as payment at walmart.  It turned out to be a fake tweet and the price immediately corrected back but the point is that the wealth levels of walmart's customers has nothing to do with this.  It has everything to do with global adoption of BTC by a major corporation that will now use and give more exposure to BTC.  So, the short version, is we've already seen that the idea of walmart using BTC as payment has had huge positive price action.  Also, this system isnt requiring people to buy BTC so the ""buying a mcdouble with btc"" isn't even what's happening."
59-5,Too bad the LN is such a mess. Honestly feeling worried about it. I love BTC but LN is a house of cards …
59-5-1,"Don't worry, its just a centralized payment app that ""uses LN on the backend"", which makes it completely pointless. Whether they open an LN channel with the exchange they're converting fiat to crypto with or whether they just dump all that money directly on the exchange makes no difference, except LN just adds more security vulnerabilities that can go wrong."
60,Bitcoin is on the ‘road to irrelevance’ warns European Central Bank
60-2,That’s exactly what a centralized bank would want us to believe
60-2-1,">Christine Lagarde, the President of the European Central Bank, also has voiced her concern that the expansion of cryptocurrency could pose a risk to the conventional banking system, as Finbold reported at the end of September.Perhaps they have a vested interest in its failure."
60-2-1-2,That is most certainly the only reason they are saying this right now.
60-2-1-2-1,Banks hating on bitcoin since 2009.
60-2-1-2-1-2,You hate what you fear.
60-2-1-2-1-2-3,"Facts mate, they want us to make believe that crypto is going nowhere. However crypto is thriving and they see crypto as a threat to the traditional banking system."
60-2-1-2-1-2-3-1,I totally agree with that and I believe that cryptocurrency is here to stay forever and that's why we should start using it.
60-2-1-2-1-2-4,"they fear a horribly resource intensive, slow, unstable, theft-prone, utterly lacking in privacy cryptocurrency with almost zero practical use cases, with a bunch of incompetents guiding its development? I really doubt it"
60-2-1-2-1-2-4-1,Let's hope that cryptocurrency is going to make big ecosystem for money and transactions so that it will be adopted by everyone.
60-2-1-2-1-2-4-2,Still better than a bank though
60-2-1-2-1-3,European Central Bank. This isn't a retail bank it's a European government organization. It's role it's is to regulate the stability of the Euro by controlling quantitive easing and interest rates. They oversee bonds. This isn't Morgan Stanley.
60-2-1-2-2,"The threat they're talking about is banks putting money into valueless assets which then depreciate to 0, causing their assets to be less than their liabilities, as happened in the housing crisis in 2008.This is what they're concerned about, because bitcoin (and all crypto) has value almost entirely based on fraud."
60-2-1-2-2-1,">entirely based on fraudAh, no. Based on what people consider it worth paying for, just like everything, art , houses, action figures, the dollar"
60-2-1-2-2-2,"And false scarcity, and without regulations and support systems, we see time and time again that the money can just vaporize.  Bitcoin may exist forever in the future, but the idea that there is forced ""scarcity"" would only work if they had a monopoly on crypto.  but they don't.  If bitcoins cost to much to use, I will use a lite coin, or other shitcoin.  The ONLY thing that gives bitcoin value is that it is accepted in many places others aren't."
60-2-1-3,Absolutely because God forbid we actually make money on our own money.
60-2-1-3-2,If you can't inflate the money supply then the people effectively have their government on a leash.
60-2-1-3-2-1,10/10 countries hate this 1 simple trick.
60-2-1-3-2-1-2,The country which is going to adopt cryptocurrency as well as blockchain technology is going to make faster progress.
60-2-1-3-4,"Bitcoin is incapable of generating value.Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. The only way to make money on Bitcoin is to find a bigger sucker than you are to buy it for more money than you paid for it.Bitcoin costs money to operate.The net value of Bitcoin is thus always negative.It is literally impossible for the holders of Bitcoin, as a group, to ever make net money."
60-2-1-3-5,"which is one reason why you want an inflationary currency, to encourage people to NOT keep their money in the banks. Which they dont, in general, anymore, especially since we went off the gold standard.Before then, it COULD be more profitable at times, to not invest to not do dick but put your money in the bank and let it sit.AND PS the biggest reason to not leave your disposible income in the bank, is ""TO MAKE MONEY OFF YOUR OWN MONEY""god forbid yall learn that fact existed before BTC was even born.ANd BTC didnt change dick about that fact.  You could have bought gold in 1980 or stocks. Now you can buy gold, stocks and crypto. DOnt act like you just invented the sun."
60-2-1-4,She’s totally unbiased. Completely trustworthy
60-2-2,Its called the european **centralized** bank for a reason.
60-2-2-1,Banks were the real centralised shitcoins all along.
60-2-2-1-1,Always will be.
60-2-2-1-1-1,Time to offload all of my shitcoins like this and put it into some real currency like Bitcoin lol
60-2-2-2,bullish on european decentralized bank
60-2-2-2-1,Any bank which is going to adopt cryptocurrency and blockchain technology along with decentralization is going to build the future for itself.
60-2-3,I think they just want to make sure we know it's the bottom
60-3,Major Buying signalAsk yourself why your bank will let you spend 25k a night in a casino but will block your account if you try to buy 100$ of Bitcoin on Binance.
60-3-1,I use this point all the time to people. Banks dont step in to stop any other form of fraud users self commit but when its crypto they are the heros of customer preservation lol
60-3-1-1,"Precisely! Casino gambling is not a threat to them, but a secondary currency is."
60-3-1-1-1,"There are regulations with gambling.In fact, please research the history of UltimateBet.  Dan Friedberg, the Chief Regulatory Officer of FTX, was involved in the cheating scandal with UltimateBet.Not only that, but Stuart Hoegner, the General Counsel for both Bitfinex and Tether used to be the Director of Compliance for Excapsa (the parent company of UltimateBet).These are the people you trust with your money.  Have fun!  Good thing you D\[id\]YOR!!!!"
60-3-1-1-1-1,There are regulations with crypto too.  So many regulations. That’s why people go to jail for crypto related crimes. It’s why FTX & Binance have entirely separate websites just for Americans.
60-3-1-1-1-1-1,What regulations?The other guy who replied to me said bitcoin was self-regulated.  You say it’s already regulated.  And there are others here who say that it’s not regulated and nor should it be.Few understand I guess…
60-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,"The usual theft to jail regulations.  It’s why FTX was not registered in America, because America had stricter regulations.  The Bitfinex hack couple were arrested & having a trial soon. The FTX CEO will definitely have a trial. I don’t get any of this talk about it not being regulated.  Hell Coinbase helps you do your taxes on your earnings. Coinbase & Binance enforce the KYC regulations."
60-3-1-1-1-2,BTC is self regulated...it's trustless. Everything else in this space should arguably be regulated if it's centralised.
60-3-1-1-1-2-1,"Well, let's hope those regulators don't get to the central bank of Bitcoin - Tether - or the Bitcoin price will plummet....."
60-3-1-2,Let’s not pretend that crypto isn’t truthfully rampant with scams and fraud
60-3-1-2-1,It absolutely is. 99.9% of it is pump and dump scam degeneracy. The constant self imploding crypto exchanges and lenders is a strong indicator that it’s mainly all scams. The *only* thing not a scam in this entire shit show is BTC and the BTC maxis will tell you they predicted these scams happening over 10 years ago.
60-3-1-3,What are you talking about banks stop fraud like that all the time. If you try and buy something they think is fraudulent like thousands worth of gift cards they’ll probably block the transaction
60-3-1-3-1,Stop you’re disrupting the circlejerk
60-3-1-3-1-1,"Man, it was getting really good too."
60-3-1-3-2,Hot take: isnt crypto basicly a gift card? Trade some fiat for some other currency that isn’t accepted everywhere?
60-3-1-3-2-1,A gift card that isn’t accepted everywhere and changes value by the minuteI’d prefer cash
60-3-1-3-4,>If you try and buy something they think is fraudulent like thousands worth of gift cards they’ll probably block the transactionBecause that's a common way of getting money out of a stolen credit card.But you can just confirm that it's really you and your card was not stolen to get the transactions unblocked.
60-3-1-3-5,I don't think fraud is the word they meant to use. I only say this because playing at a casino and buying crypto are both NOT forms of fraud in any way...
60-3-1-3-5-1,"Crypto is all fraud, actually. It's all a ponzi scheme."
60-3-1-4,"They stop all kinds of fraud, actually. It's literally required of them.Blocking transactions that are likely fraudulent is very common.Casino gambling is not fraud. It's a form of entertainment, and the casino industry is regulated."
60-3-3,European Central Bank. This isn't a retail bank it's a European government organization. It's role it's is to regulate the stability of the Euro by controlling quantitive easing and interest rates. They oversee bonds. This isn't Morgan Stanley or Wells Fargo.
60-3-5,"Because Binance is engaged in fraud while a casino is a regulated business?This isn't a hard question to answer.Also, LPT:Governments taking action to shut down the Ponzi scheme will put an end to the charade.The reality is that the amount of real money in Crypto is tiny, probably less than 5% of its face value.Crypto has no actual value ($0), unlike a corporation or similar asset, so when the whole fraudulent scheme gets shut down, all the money that is available is the assets that the fraudsters have - which is not much.Governments shutting down the ability of crypto actors to continue to defraud the public will immediately tank the price of crypto to very nearly $0."
60-3-5-1,"I see you are really jealous and bitter about not believing in crypto 5 years ago but your irrational hate won’t stop it’s adoption, sorry."
60-5,European Central Bank is on the ‘road to irrelevance’ warns Bitcoin. Fixed it for you.
60-5-2,"CBCDs on the 'road to irrelevance', warn two r/cryptocurrency users"
60-5-2-1,two **Expert** r/cryptocurrency users!
60-5-2-1-1,Three now! This is true exponential growth.
60-5-3,Already is. They are suffering the consequences of printing mountains of money.
60-5-3-2,"Proving that from a fundamental perspective, FIAT currencies are a true shitcoin."
60-5-3-2-1,Maybe that’s why people are so happy to invest in shitcoins since they already hold fiat
60-5-4,As a European I agree. This year euro strength made me enjoy staying in crypto
60-5-4-1,But... Crypto is down even more
60-5-4-1-3,"Heavily depends on the timeframe you're looking at. For this year you're absolutely right, for the last 10 years the Euro gets crashed. Imo long term trends matter more than short term trends, so I think we're good."
60-5-4-1-3-1,So the euro loses 20% value over 2 years and bitcoin lost… 67% of its value in a year.Idk man
60-5-4-1-3-1-1,"Time frame again. The longer you make it, the better Bitcoin looks"
60-5-4-1-3-1-1-1,"It doesn't, because the massive volatility is not good for a currency, it is good as a get-rich-quick scheme."
60-5-4-1-3-1-1-3,No it fucking doesn’t
60-5-4-1-3-1-1-4,"No it doesn't. You can't cherrypick buying BTC like 10 years ago and compare it to stable fiat currencies. For all you and I know something happens and BTC crashes down to like 5k again and never gets the trust or enthusiasm to get back to its all time highs. Bitcoin itself was inflated by overprinting of major currencies like the USD and Euro which gave people the disposable income at the time to buy and gamble on crypto. That 65k+ BTC high was fueled by an oversupply of fiat money in the real world and as soon as inflation caught up and reduced everyone's disposable real income, they pulled money out of crypto and stopped buying more crypto. That's why it has crashed. Until we see a stable rate of inflation and everyone has loads of disposable income again, crypto isn't going back up. It's not a coincidence that crypto peaked during a pandemic when governments were giving every single person repeated free payments of cash. Are you like 10 years old?"
64,Bitcoin Lightning Network used in South Africa
64-1,The peoples money!
64-1-1,"Yep, that's what it's about. It's all about the masses here."
64-2,Awesome 
64-2-1,I'm going to send to this wallet asking to pay for next person's apple. I just love using lightning
64-2-1-1,"Great idea!I tried but it's too low res, couldn't scan it.OP, do you have a high-res version or care to share the LN address?Edit: I'll try this linkEdit 2: Better res but still too low and didn't scan"
64-2-1-1-3,I was able to scan the QR code shown in the video just fine. The LNURL posted at the Nitter link that /u/CoinCorner_Sam is posting here is the same as in the QR code in the video.
64-2-1-2,I have a ledger how do I use it?
64-2-1-2-1,"Install Muun wallet on your phone (self custodial) or wallet of satoshi (custodial) like they used.Edit: In short: Ledger is to store your wealth safe, the Bitcoin lightning wallets is to do (small) payments."
64-2-2,"This is as awesome as it gets, brings me complete joy."
64-3,Now THIS kind of thing gets me excited.
64-3-1,This made me excited and as well as emotional man. Love it.
64-4,The future 
64-4-1,"The future is here, we're making great progress towards it."
64-4-2,"Is it though? Why are we seeing adoption in these dirt poor countries, and not countries with already functioning banking systems? Is it because Bitcoin can't compete with modern western banking systems?  I personally think so. Why would i change out my free, instant, contactless, safe, 100% fraud insured, and even cashback giving credit cards with Bitcoin which doesn't really do any of that, and the stuff it does, it does worse?"
64-4-2-2,It's called privileges. Which most people in the world don't have.
64-4-2-2-1,"Yeah, but as an optimist i assume they'll eventually get as good banking and payment systems as Western Europe, for example. When that happens, why will the average person keep using Bitcoin?"
64-4-2-3,This is my home town. South Africa isn't dirt poor but there are massive wealth distribution problems. You can open a bank account and use apple pay. I do daily in the same town that this video was made. This shop is likely owned by a foreigner (from another african country) so he probably uses Bitcoin as it's easier for him to move it across boarders than it is to make international ETF payments.
64-4-2-3-1,"Yeah, sorry about that, i know South Africa isn't dirt poor. The area in the video, doesn't look too well off though. Shopkeeper behind bars, broken ipad and all."
64-4-2-3-1-1,No worries dude. Yeah the specific area that this is probably the poorest part of this town. So I agree that it's not a great testament. But it's an example of a usecase regardless.
64-5,Broken ipads and free wifi will change this world more than we know.
64-5-1,Just wait till starlinks fully deployed and every rural place on earth has the option for internet.
64-5-1-2,"Starlink atm is expensive and that's on the USD. Imagine how much a monthly fee would cost in 3rd world countries. And who is gonna pay for that, certainly not subsidized by the government.  Let's chill a bit."
64-5-1-2-1,"Rural communities already pay high fees for a communal satellite system. The difference being starlinks is cheaper, more reliable, and designed for the intended purpose of bringing cheap wifi to the masses and Not to serve solely first world countries.Starlinks current high price is only due to it's early rollout and testing. Prices will drop dramatically when full rollout has been achieved."
64-5-1-2-1-3,Starlink just raised their prices today..
64-5-1-2-1-3-2,Cool story bro. Question. Have they fully released their final product globally yet or are they still in early deployment?
64-5-1-4,It won’t be starlinkLook up ASTSpacemobile - satellite service to regular cellphones across Africa is their first deployment
64-5-1-4-1,"Ah yes, some startup no one knows about will be the first to get high speed internet with satellites to the entire continent of Africa!"
64-5-1-4-1-1,"Ah yes, some EV company noone knows about will be the first to install superchangers across the US and change the entire auto industry?See how things look like in hindsight when game changing technology comes into play?"

65-1-1-1,Can't wait for 2020 to be over with
65-1-1-1-1,It has been a weirdly long year
65-1-1-1-1-1,"Time flies when you're having fun. But also the opposite, apparently !"
65-1-1-1-1-1-1,"There is study on this - during the pandemic we were desperate for routines amidst uncertain times, we found routines easily and found them often, but this made time speed up. So you're dealing with stress with routines while your life seems to going by too quickly. Leads to depression unfortunately and, well, obviously."
65-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,I went to clean my attic only to find stacks and stacks of puzzles.  So before throwing them out (Sent to charity shop/local homeless shelter) i decided to build them all. I shit you not... Doing a 1000 piece puzzle that's made of a dense city makes time slow the fuck down. It felt like a lifetime doing that puzzle.  Charity shop wanted to sell the puzzles for silly money so i took them to a local homeless shelter where they gave them to hostels around the county for those living there to have something to do.
65-1-1-1-1-1-2,Crypto makes time go faster and us age faster
65-1-1-1-1-1-2-2,"Can confirm, I have aged 10 years since this bullrun started"
65-1-1-1-1-1-4,"I wanna be in Joe Biden’s shoes. That guy is trapped in 2010, he still has a chance to buy a few bags of Bitcoin."

65-2,I don’t think it will get there by 2021.  Just don’t see it happening.
65-2-1,BTC will surely reach 100k in 2021 Q8
65-2-1-1,Let's get through Q5 of 2020 first shall we??

65-3,Btc will be $100k by July. Mark my words. If I'm wrong I'll delete this comment.
65-3-1,Pretty much any crypto influencer ever 
65-3-5,Put up some real collateral and delete your account.
65-3-5-1,I'd never wager my account. I'm a crypto speculator so it's the only thing I will realistically be leaving to my children.
65-4,Lmao 10 days of green and 100k is on the table again love this sub mate cheers
65-4-1,"Once it inevitably drops and goes red for couple of days, you’ll see several posts like these:1. This is your time to DCA in!2. You asked for a dip! Here it is!3. TA on why it’ll drop more4. I traded on leverage, help"
65-4-2,Plus this prediction implies we time travel.  (2021)
65-4-2-1,"Satoshi was a brilliant scientist. The time he created BTC, little he knew he also created a thing that bends time, a market that works like a time traveling machine"
65-5,"Another day, another 100k EOY 2021 prediction. One of these days its gonna come true surely"
65-5-1,It did. We just haven't seen it in our hearts yet.
65-5-1-1,I want to see it in my portfolio
65-5-1-1-1,One day we shall achieve it. This year has been weirdly long.
65-5-1-1-1-1,TA indicates 10th quarter of 2021 in order for BTC to hit 100k and above. We still have a long time before 21 ends so I'm hopeful
65-5-2,"another 2021, another 100k*"
69,"JUST IN: Bitcoin transactions up to $200 will be tax-free under Senator Lummis' new bill, encouraging use as currency, and also the bill will protect the right to self-custody bitcoin "
69-1,"Good start but should up that limit to $1,000 because of inflation with the US dollar"
69-1-1,"She has to start small,  or the bill would never get past the senate approval process in the current climate.Once a foot is in the door, and more hearts and minds have been won over,  then more aggressive revisions can be sought."
69-1-1-1,Agreed. Start with 200$ and get to 2000$ soon
69-1-1-2,true. until the idiots in the room figure out it is indeed a also currency and medium of exchange and it should not be taxed like an investment or asset.
69-1-1-3,"This. But also, they need to wait until we see if the midterms reshuffle the sides a bit. Limited chance this gets thru the current regime, even with Gillibrand's support."
69-1-1-4,Indeed the fact though never be in a hurry that can indeed screw things up though.
69-1-2,"I agree. The same can be said about old laws that are not adjusted for inflation. The ""Bank Secrecy Act"" established in 1970 which defines 10k usd as the reporting requirement for travel and banks reporting to FINCEN has not been adjusted for inflation for many years. 10k usd in 1970 dollars has had $74,513 USD in purchasing power. IMHO the BSA is unconstitutional , but when brought to the supreme court some justices argued that it was fine because it was such a large amount of money(10k in 1970 was as you can see) that it did not impact normal people in their daily lives when the reality is that due to inflation 10k is a very small sum of money these days and often impacts everyday txs (used cars/boats)200 dollars exception is better than nothing (many normal people are uncomfortable with adopting bitcoin as p2p money if they are taxed per tx), but also absurdly small where in a few years that will be the average cost of a normal (non fine dining) dinner at a restaurant for 2."
69-1-2-2,I can break purchases into $200 segments.
69-1-2-2-1,I think they call that structuring and it's illegal
69-1-2-2-1-2,Structuring is about breaking up transactions to gain privacy.  Breaking up transactions to avoid capital gains taxes is probably not illegal (but I don't actually know).
69-1-2-2-1-2-1,"It's never been challenged in court. Even in the case of privacy, there's no law against that, it's just in general that it is illegal. For example, if you publicly announced you were structuring payments as an extension of your first amendment right to free expression (ie, spending money) as per Citizen's United, I'm not sure there's a prosecutor that would prosecute you. But no one's put forth this kind of challenge that I know of."
69-1-2-4,"I agree with you for the most part but your exaggerations are seriously hurting your argument and make you look silly, do you honestly believe that inflation is going to rise more than 400% in two years?In 2020 could you get dinner for two for $12?"
69-1-2-4-1,>In 2020 could you get dinner for two for $12?That seems like a difficult number to achieve for even fast food these days Fine dining for me is 200-400 usd these days for 2 due to a bottle or 2 of wine most of the time. In some places much more if its a more expensive restaurant. Right now any decent (non fine dining) restaurant will cost 2 adults 60-120 usd  usually(You need to tip at least 20 % to be decent) In a few years (5-10) I can easily see this getting closer to 200usd
69-1-2-4-1-1,"I was asking you where you could get a sit down dinner for two for $12, not telling you, and thats because excluding fast food you really couldnt, and havent been able to for a long time. The whole point of my comment was just saying your numbers are exaggerated. You can head on down to any old average joe sit down place and get dinner for two for 40$ pretty easy."
69-1-3,"Nah not even close. NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX on Bitcoin. Period. That is where we need to be to adopt as a currency. $200 is a joke and I will still never spend my Bitcoin when I could just save it and spend fiat. Once we get rid of cap gains, I would spend my BTC on everything."
69-1-3-1,Doesn't every other currency manage while being subject to capital gains?   Yall are hilarious.
69-1-3-1-1,There's no capital gains for using USD as a currency.
69-1-3-1-1-1,Try to do currency trading and see what the IRS has to say when you dont pay them.
69-1-3-1-1-1-2,Currency trading and using BTC as currency are two different things. right?
69-1-3-1-1-2,Haha no there's a capital loss tax though (inflation)
69-1-3-1-1-2-1,Being a part of the game and the economy after all. This happens by time and the market conditons!
69-1-3-1-1-3,Every other currency does though right?Then there is the debate on whether or not BTC should even really be classified as a currency...
69-1-3-1-2,Make BTC legal tender is my point. This $200 is a joke. BaBy StEps. Lol
69-1-3-1-2-1,So what other currencies should become legal tender as well?   The yen?   Euro?   Yuan?   Etc?Why should BTC be exempted from rules?Your idea seems like a joke.
69-1-3-1-2-1-1,"I guess I'm just a little bit ahead of my time. When we need that tax rule, it will unfortunately be too late for most. Why not start now? If you think USD still has legs to stand on, I've got a couple years bad news for you, or a war to sellyou. BTC is the future and we need to embrace it NOW."
69-1-3-1-2-1-1-1,"Sounds like you have little clue on how an economy works.> When we need that tax rule, it will unfortunately be too late for most.How so?   Sounds like you think BTC holders shouldn't have to pay capital gains tax ""just because"".   I don't think that's a great argument."
69-1-3-1-2-1-1-2,"That is indeed a major cause where taxation concern peoples.The fact that we need to look more into this taxation, where poor to at a some extent pays that."
69-1-3-1-2-1-4,"Btc already is a legal tender to El Salvador, they pay their debts in BTC and it gets accepted"
69-1-3-1-3,Lol they dont get it
69-1-3-4,True though more like the people are indeed concerned about holding.The fact that they be spending more fiat then to that of Bitcoin instead make it last in the long run.
69-1-5,"$5,000.00"
69-2,Oh cool so a tank of gas
69-2-1,"It's actually so weird to introduce limits like those without accounting for inflation.It's like the limit of $10,000 before triggering all sorts of mandatory KYC/AML bullshit, they instated limits like these decades ago when $10,000 was a much more substantial amount and they'll most likely never change it, making the law more strict each time they fuck up the economy with their inflationist policies."
69-2-1-1,"Yeah, the rule should be denominated in BTC."
69-2-1-3,"They did account for inflation, you just failed to recognize their intentions and motives because you believe they are as dumb as they seem."
69-2-1-4,"It would have been way better to set the tax-free amount in terms of Satoshis, not in terms of USD. For example it would have been great to see up to 1m sats (right now around $300) being exempted."
69-2-1-4-1,"I think they might be concerned that 1m sats could become a pretty large sun of money soon. I get why they price things in terms they understandAlso, while we might think Bitcoin is the clear winner, they need to write the laws to account for other crypto. I don't want the government to pick the winners"
69-2-1-4-1-1,So they're bullish? Good ;)
69-2-1-4-1-2,Somewhat we need to give things time though so that it gets set out accordingly.Nevertheless we have some great days ahead with Crypto shinning ahead and Bitcoin being at moon.
69-2-1-4-2,Good idea but 300 doesnt cover most my grocery runs.
69-2-3,It’s per transaction so unless you’re constantly buying stuff over $200 this would allow most daily purchases to go under the limit.Not optimal but the bills with higher limits hit too much resistance.
69-2-3-1,What about the tax that they would indeed charge for that though.Like we could somewhat bring a limitations to that though make things be better enough.
69-3,People in this thread are really acting as though they could have negotiated a better tax deal in a country that doesn't even want to recognise bitcoin as a currency.
69-3-1,Even if it was a currency you would have to pay taxes on your gains in the US.
69-3-1-1,"Yeah, people in this thread are arguing for stuff they don’t understand the tax ramifications for.A carve out like what Lummis is pushing for is the best legal outcome second only to the US adopting BTC as a national currency, which just isn’t going to happen anytime soon.Keeping it an asset that qualifies for long term capital gains while allowing smaller purchases to go tax free is by far the best possible outcome that’s actually achievable.All non-USD currencies are subject to taxes on exchange gains and the only reason nobody ever pays these when traveling abroad is because there’s a carve out for small gains from purchases made abroad! Legally this lets them treat BTC more like spending foreign currency when traveling and exempts it from tax"
69-3-1-1-1,"how is the limit not going to be exploited with high frequency/high volume of sub 200 dollar transactions?If I pull out a million from BTC, using about 5,200 transactions of 199$ each wouldn't that be completely tax free?"
69-3-3,Even this passing would really impress me. It mostly benefits natural persons and only a handful of corporations.
69-3-3-1,"Though I'd say ""mainstream"" people rather than ""natural"", I agree with your sentiment - and it would also allow businesses to get involved, which can smoothen a path towards Bitcoin adoption - which further smoothens the bitcoin towards bitcoin being seen as a currency."
69-4,then hyper inflation hits and now you can buy a pack of gum with $200
69-4-3,"Hyperinflation by definition means any inflation rate of 25% and above. At 25% it would take almost 24 years for a one dollar pack of chewing gum to be as expensive as $200.So your example might be a bit exaggerated, at least for now. But taking a look at the complete picture you are of course right. Within the given timeframe a lot of things had to be overthought and readjusted."
69-4-3-2,"There is no definitive definition of hyperinflation, but it us usually a lot higher than 25%. Turkey, for example, is not experiencing hyperinflation right now.Found this:""Hyperinflation refers to rapid and unrestrained price increases in an   economy, typically at rates exceeding 50% each month over time."""
69-4-3-2-2,"At least it's very unlikely that a pack of gum *suddenly* costs about 200 times as much.Regarding the bill it would have been way better to set the tax-free amount in terms of Satoshis, not in terms of USD. For example it would have been great to see up to 1m sats (right now around $300) being exempted."
69-4-3-2-2-1,"I completely agree. My point was only regarding the definition of the term ""hyperinflation"", which is bandied around a lot here :-D&#x200B;>Regarding the bill it would have been way better to set the tax-free   amount in terms of Satoshis, not in terms of USD. For example it would   have been great to see up to 1m sats (right now around $300) being   exempted.But that would also become weird when bitcoin does its next 10x... I think we have a problem either way. We really need some kind of virtual asset that is ""truly stable"", that we can measure against. E.g. a CPI-like basket of goods, that we somehow actually trust."
70,PayPal Lets Users Transfer Bitcoin and Ethereum to External Wallets
70-1,PayPal linking up better with crypto is such a huge leap towards better and more widespread crypto adoption
70-1-1,"more accessibility definitely, can't think of many people who don't have paypal. even my grandma uses it"
70-1-1-1,"If grandma uses it, you can guarantee everybody can use it. That's why PayPal is good for crypto"
70-1-1-1-1,"Also, PayPal pushing something like this will trigger more business to do the same or to move towards making crypto more ""easy"" to use for the global market.Not too long ago one of the main counter-crypto statements was the lack of credibility, PayPal made its way and its name, this will help for sure.100% good news."
70-1-1-1-2,"I was saying this through the last bull market... I got the not your keys argument regarding PP many rimes, I use pp, but my counter is Im not personally showing grandma how to use cold storage wallet ever.  Services like PP enables adoption"
70-1-1-3,"I know someone who went to sell all their Bitcoin last year around ATH, and PayPal froze their account for 6 months. I can't imagine how much money they must have lost because of that."
70-1-2,"PayPal understood that they're a payment service and don't have to fight crypto, just because it could replace USD. Many people will still use services like PayPal even with crypto."
70-1-3,It will increase the crypto transactions for sure!
70-1-3-1,"With PayPal being such a huge household name, it's undoubtedly a step in the right direction for crypto"
70-1-3-1-1,For a one world currency tbh
70-1-5,Do you know if this is only offered to US account holders? Last I checked they didn't offer it to Canada or UK yet.
70-2,"Good for me. I got a little bit of coins lingering on there. Was my introduction to crypto. Sold some junk and eBay and forgot about the cash, so I moved it into BTC."
70-2-3,>Was my introduction to cryptoAnd now hopefully we get a bunch more people saying the same thing
70-4,"PayPal Executive Fernandez da Ponte: ""There’s a lot of discussion about crypto winter, but it’s important to see beyond that,"" he said. ""The macro trend [of broad crypto adoption] is undisturbed.""I'm already liking this guy"
70-5,This is really a huge step to increase adoption.
74,"Bitcoin breaks through $46,000 for first time since January"
74-1,"It feels so odd that it has been green for what.. a week and half? Bought some at 39-41k but ran out of fiat because I had IRL home issues (roof needed repair, set me back). I'm skeptical.. but hopeful. Might be safe to buy in now before it goes to 50k and I regret it"
74-1-1,I think FOMO buyers will come today and we will reach 50k around when the stock market opens.
74-1-1-1,Yes I can't wait for the stock market to open so I can buy more crypto. /s
74-1-1-1-1,It’s not crazy to think people will sell stocks to buy crypto.
74-1-1-1-3,"I’ve been a long time crypto investor and I only buy through the market now. I know it’s “not my keys, not my coins”. BUT buying through the market I’ve just maxed my tax free accounts so I can enjoy all of these sweet future gains tax free!"
74-1-3,No don't buy in now lol we can always go back down
74-1-3-1,Is this not r/wallstreetbets ?
74-1-3-1-1,What's the possibility of crypto becoming worthless and people losing thousands of dollars on a crypto currency? I have still yet to figure out how you use it.
74-1-3-1-1-1,"If crypto becomes worthless, it will be billions of dollars, if not trillions. Not going to happen."
74-1-3-1-1-2,"Don't worry, everyone's already experiencing fiat losing all its value via inflation and runaway Fed printing."
74-1-3-1-1-3,At this point. To many believe and want out of fiat. The fed is print disaster. Everyone is aware of what banks are doing with our money. Good luck stopping any of this. Regulation can't cover the globe.Game over
74-1-3-1-1-3-1,I always want to start the crypto journey but when I look up how to mine I get trapped into some phone scam with some guy with an Indian accent calling from a European phone number that doesn't trace back to anything...
74-1-3-1-1-3-1-1,Aww .. this kinda reply tells Me :I need to troll backMmmkay *rubs  hands warms cold black heart   im microwave*So ... you know? They have these places? They are called college or higher education  right? *sips whiskeys throws stacks of hundreds on fire place .... *Ahhh this whiskey takes like like Jennifer Lawrence on a Tuesday at soho house 
74-1-3-1-1-3-2,It is so cute when people think that crypto including that with limited supply is not subjected to inflation.
74-1-3-1-1-4,I can write you a detailed guide on how to use crypto. You  can pay me in BTC
74-1-3-2,"And then we can always go even lower than that.No one knows when to buy.Best bet is always gonna be buy now, wait 3-5 years."
74-1-3-3,wait for the 20k? i got this advice in summer. You promised! Never again i trust people like you
74-1-3-3-1,"When did I say wait for 20k? Ive never said that btw. Truth is you just shouldn't buy the fomo, buy the fud instead. Current price is fomo"
74-1-4,"Totally, handling FOMO feelings again."
74-1-5,Better to space out buys while it's low than wait for confirmation.
74-4,Now do 50k!
74-4-1,Do 100k! I double dare you!
74-4-1-1,100k in 2021.
74-4-1-1-1,Do 250k! I triple dare you
74-4-1-1-2,We hope friend
74-4-1-1-3,Uhhhhh. Not quite.
74-4-1-1-4,"Well now it's 2024 -- no problem, update your models. I've been buying under $40k but over the next couple years, that will get bumped up to buying under $60k. $100k in 2024 is all but a guarantee imo."
74-4-1-2,I double-doge dare you!
74-4-1-4,Before EOY at least!
74-4-1-5,Easy there!  I can only get so aroused.
74-4-2,Let's do 69k already!!!
74-4-2-1,"BTC to $69,420 "
74-4-3,Just a few more hours and we will get there.
74-5,"Wow, we did something we already did before."
74-5-2,It's going to reach some number it was just recently.
75,Bitcoin has now recovered all its losses since FTX collapsed
75-1,Bitcoin  &  and related info are in the collapsed comments below. Pros and cons will change for every new post.
75-1-1,"* Relevant Cointest topics: , , , * Official and related subreddits: r/Bitcoin, r/BitcoinMarkets, r/BitcoinMining, r/BTC, r/BitcoinCash.* Sort comments as controversial first by . Doesn't work on mobile."
75-2,Can it recover all it lost from oct 2021 pretty please
75-2-1,"Can we choose November 2021 instead? I want to see new ATH's.$69000 Bitcoin, $55 DOT, $4800 ETH. Yes please. I'll take $0.35 Moons to go."
75-2-1-1,Hearing of those highs is plain torture especially DOT. I had mine all staked and unstaking them took 28 days and by then that $55 high was reduced to a fraction
75-2-1-1-1,"My story is quite similar, got into at $46, staked it and when I got it back it was $12. At least I made all you guys proud of me."
75-2-1-1-1-2,Similar story with Atom; Just compounding away the rewards and waiting for the day it reaches triple digits
75-2-1-1-1-3,It should recover I hope
75-2-1-1-2,"Haha same... But polkadot i see go up in the bull run like bitcoin, so patience will be rewarded I guess"
75-2-1-2,"Can we skip and go straight to $100k BTC, $10k ETH and $3.5 Moons. I want to see myself retire"
75-2-1-2-2,Wait I'm not done buying cheap.
75-2-1-2-2-1,Yeah hold the fuck up people please. No where near done accumulating.
75-2-1-2-2-1-1,"Hoping the same. I would love another year of accumulating, it's too soon. This first rally is already stressing me out."
75-2-1-2-2-1-2,"Seriously, I only earn so fast.  Which is not actually fast at all.  I need more time to buy."
75-2-1-2-2-1-3,Can’t we compromise and just have a little more profit?
75-2-1-2-2-1-3-1,Won't be selling anytime soon so I'm not sure about that bro .
75-2-1-2-3,They say retirement comes before the die. True ?
75-2-1-2-4,Me too. My job is horror.  But I will need a lot more than $100k BTC unfortunately.  Still hopeful and DCA'ing all the way down and hopefully all the  way up too.
75-2-1-2-4-1,"It couldntake many years, but it will be worth it"
75-2-1-3,I am REALLY curious about Moons the next bullrun. Most people who frequented this sub throughout 2021(?) and 22 have a little bit saved up unknowingly. At the peak you could make a very decent living just Moon farming on this sub. What will that be like now that it's on mainnet?
75-2-1-3-1,Still don’t even know what the point of them is
75-2-1-3-1-1,"You could say that about crypto in general. Or at least most of it.    At the least, Moons are a community currency, where you can trade stuff or reward others."
75-2-1-3-2,10 dol per moon or nothing
75-2-1-4,"and before Voyager, Celsius, FTX and other exchanges crashed....So that I can try to time when i sholuld get out... and most probably still loose"
75-2-1-5,>I'll take $0.35 Moons to go.What an undervalued price we got last bullrun
75-2-1-5-1,"You guys never learn, eh? That's why scammers like SBF etc. will always be around. Wake up."
75-2-1-5-3,Imagine if it got to $1. *jizzes in pants*
75-2-1-5-3-1,69 cents is the trigger my man *jizzes everwhere
75-2-2,I'd also like to recover all the girls I dated in 2022-2019 plz. Well mostly just Ashley. If you're reading this Ashley plz come back.
75-2-3,"May come sooner than you realize. With all the lending programs shuttered (blockfi, Voyager, Gemini Earn, Genesis, etc) there will be much less artificial Bitcoin being lent out, which should allow prices to more easily squeeze up"
75-2-3-1,"Yeah right now no big funds can really borrow substantial bitcoin to short, and ftx isn’t able to sell nonexistent bitcoin and then take user bitcoin to dump to go pump FTT.So upwards moves may be shockingly strong. Has the real beast of Bitcoin been unleashed?!"
75-2-3-2,We new the cleanse was needed and is going to be good mid-long term
75-2-4,"The thing most of the market doesn't understand is that it will likely blow past that so fast the next few bull runs, that it will be too hard to time or catch. I believe it will happen so suddenly that once again everyone will wish they had just held. When you take a plane somewhere you don't try to hop on last second or you risk getting left behind... you buy your ticket early for the best price and take your seat. So when it's time for take off you aren't begging the counter attendees to hold the plane so you can check your luggage. You should be sitting in your seat ready for take off."
75-2-4-1,"This. I remember the take off in the 2nd half of 2020. When we got past $20k the 2017 ATH, $24k came quickly then by new year $30k and within a day it rose to $33k. Then Tesla bought and we jumped to $40k and $47k in the blink of an eye."
75-2-5,The Terra/Luna collapse is what we really need to recover from. By the time FTX went down it had already been a slaughter
75-2-5-1,"pair it with the halving and a global economy recovery, now you have a bull run trigger"
75-3,Bitcoin going 100k by 2024. Source: Your FOMO.
75-3-2,"It's interesting to think that if BTC really did hit $100,000 at the end of 2024, it would have the 3-year growth rate below that of several major stocks."
75-3-2-1,I saw that post about 280k BTC 2025 and I won't take anything else
75-3-2-1-1,"Daring today, aren't we."
75-3-3,Ah shit here we go again
75-3-4,My FOMO is a pretty good source. It told me CRO would reach $1 by 2021 so we're right in schedule.
75-3-5,Ive been watching youtube vids and some are saying 400k is the most accurate assessment givin all the statical data and kathy wood and telsa and stuff like that
75-3-5-1,"??  Kathy wood has lost an insane amount of money, even compared to regular stocks. She's a verified loser"
75-3-5-2,20k higher and it’s a deal
75-4,"Other than, you know, the people with bitcoin in FTX"
75-4-1,Dicks out for FTX homies
75-4-1-1,I only pull my dick out for Harambe.
75-4-2,And those who sold low and are waiting for higher levels to buy again.
75-4-3,"What would the peak price of most cryptos have been if all the FTX purchase trade volume had actually hit the market?You know, instead of being embezzled."
75-4-4,"But those of us with Bitcoin or other crypto in our own wallets with our own keys, are sitting pretty."
75-4-5,Hope don't have to wait the same than mt gox dudes
75-5,To the moon! And back down
75-5-1,Buy the Moon!
82,"Bitcoin has finished 8 green candles in a row. That happens less frequently than you might think. If it finishes green every day until Friday, that's the longest streak since 2012!I just noticed that BTC has finished 8 green candles in a row. You don't see that too often, so I was curious when it happened last, and how rare it really is. So I looked into it."
82-1,OP just killed the bull run
82-1-3,If i buy then we might as well cause a flash crash
82-2,I’m just here to remind people that 2021 doesn’t end until BTC hits 100k
82-2-1,If this green streak continues we will definitely see 100k 2021 BTC quicker than we thought.
82-2-1-1,Hopefully we get hit 100k by the end of 2021 Q6
82-2-1-1-1,maybe 2020 Q1
82-2-1-2,My portfolio would love that thank you very much
82-2-1-2-1,My debt collector would love this very much.
82-2-1-3,Am I the only one sick of all the 100k 2021 jokes?
82-2-1-3-1,**They’ll never get old.**
82-2-1-3-1-1,I’ve been ceaselessly entertained by them for 3 months now. Let’s see if we can make it 4.BTC could always ruin the joke by cracking 100k
82-2-1-3-2,Most definitely not.
82-2-1-3-2-1,Overused to the point of a lame clichE.
82-2-1-3-2-1-2,It's not overused until you can't get moons for saying it... so get ready to see it for the next 3 months
82-2-1-3-3,"Yep, especially when we have 9 more months until 2022 and there's planty of time to pass the mark."
82-2-1-3-4,everyone knows we will hit 100k when the next halving gets priced in
82-2-1-4,And then finally 2022 can begin
82-2-1-5,Maybe 2021 Q 1.5
82-2-1-5-1,It’s about to 2021 Q6
82-2-2,Today is obviously December 119th 2021
82-2-2-1,Shib will reach a penny on December 420690th 2021.
82-2-2-1-1,"Only because a $1000 will buy less than a penny does today.Actually, I doubt fiat will be around in 1152 years, if humans are still around it'll be crypto, gold (if nukes take us back to the stone age)... or maybe space ore?But nah, I'm sure your cryptokitties will hold up"
82-2-2-1-1-1,Finally someone who believes in my cryptokitties
82-2-2-2,I can't wait for December 420th 2021
82-2-4,It hit 96k in Australia so it must count for something
82-3,&#x200B;!
82-3-1,We all like those green dildos and the bulls!
82-3-1-1,All I see is a bear getting wrecked
82-3-1-2,I'm ready for green dildos
82-3-1-3,"I for one love them, and I guess the bull part is alright too"
82-3-2,!
82-3-2-2,That looks disgusting
82-3-2-2-1,That's an investor doing TA at wall street. This signal means a double bear market in both directions.
82-3-3,Ah that gif again. We are truely back in a bull market.
82-4,Now i want to know the record for red candles
82-4-1,"8 (happened twice, both times in 2014)"
82-4-1-1,My man be quick with the answers and facts
82-4-1-1-1,Also his username applies
82-4-1-1-1-2,Number of moons is a little unnerving though.
82-5,you jinxed it!
82-5-1,"Sorry, it’ll go down now because I bought some."
82-5-1-1,Shit if I buy we might as well cause flash crash
82-5-1-2,If we all buy it will crash soon
82-5-1-3,I see you got that same superpower as I do
82-5-2,It just noped the 200 day
82-5-3,"I don't see any jinxing here, it's just a fact which really happened in 2012"
83,The biggest exodus of Bitcoin ever to cold storage has begun.! Bullish sign.
83-1,the cold rush begins!
83-1-1,Might want to copy write that
83-1-1-2,"Cold Rush u/AdamJensensCoatSorry, It's mine now.Cold Rush has become more than just a brand – it is a spirit and a philosophy, a reminder just how powerful Cold Storage can be. Any illegal reproduction of the Cold Rush name and wordmark will result in immediate legal action."
83-1-3,Serious question as I'm relatively new: how do you store your bitcoin in a way that is easy to access but also available to you in the case of emergency or God forbid something happens to you and your family can't get it.Don't need details just general.I have kids and a will and it scares me that if something happens to me they won't be able to access it.It's a tradeoff between safety of not letting anyone get it and safety of it being available for others
83-1-3-1,You can store a wallet on your phone or dedicated hardware device like a Ledger or Trezor or others.  Then you can store your seed phrase (24 words needed to recreate the wallet from scratch) somewhere more secure like a safe or with your lawyer and will.
83-1-3-1-1,That's a good idea.  Makes it tough every time you transact or buy more but it does make sense
83-1-3-1-1-1,"You can keep a modest amount in a more convenient and separate wallet, for casual uses, but you don't want to make that your long term investment storage.  The same way you might keep monthly spending money in your checking account but you would not want to keep your retirement savings there."
83-1-3-1-1-1-1,"Or a small amount on a mobile device in a Lightning wallet only protected by some PIN, a bit bigger amount on another one still on some platform for selling it when needed, but the biggest part should be in a wallet.Most important: Don't forget your password to the cold wallet. You need to really remember it, not just in muscle memory."
83-1-3-1-1-2,"Transactions with your phone are really easy and fast.  Some people are nervous about storing large sums of money on a phone wallet, but that's up to you.Hardware wallets aren't much slower, but you have to keep them with you.  Some have Bluetooth and others USB.  I can connect a Ledger S to an Android phone via USB to sign transactions.The seed phrase backup is only needed if you lose your digital wallet.  If your phone or hardware wallet dies, then you have a slow backup you can use to restore it."
83-1-3-1-1-3,"You can export the extended public key from your hardware onto BlueWallet or similar on your phone.This way, you can generate new addresses to make new deposits and check the balance, and still not be able to make payments for safety reasons."
83-1-3-2,Exchange your Bitcoin for a real currency like USD and put it an FDIC insured bank account.
83-1-3-2-1,Ummmm in the climate of today's world? If you are going to exchange your crypto into anything else it should be gold or silver not Fiat.
83-1-3-2-1-1,What do you mean climate of today's world? If you bought USD with BTC a year ago you'd be up almost 300%.
83-1-3-2-1-1-2,"what happened last year, last month or today is no indication of what will happen tomorrow, next month or next year."
83-1-3-2-1-1-2-1,"I never claimed it did. This would be a more appropriate response to all the people that post charts with TA voodoo arrows and highlights ""proving"" that bitcoin is primed to rip based on past dips."
83-1-3-5,"Many people have outlined a protocol to leave bitcoin inheritance. Passwords, on offramp exchange, and private keys must be available to whom you’re leaving your assets too."
83-1-3-5-1,Any links or anything you'd recommend to read more?
83-1-3-5-1-1,"It was a long time ago when I saw it, but if you simply do a Google search for, “steps for leaving crypto inheritance“, you should find plenty of tutorials. If you have a true understanding of how bitcoin works, you can essentially work out the steps yourself. Everything you need to do to get your bitcoin is everything they are going to need to know how to do."
83-2,"Exchanges gonna get a stress test, we'll see who \*actually\* has the reserves they claim"
83-2-1,The people fleeing FTX put all the customer BTCs into a cold wallet
83-2-2,How could any exchange not think this is going to happen?
83-2-2-1,Greed. Same shit they pull at all the banks.
83-3,"I need more time in the fiat mines anyway, so I’m happy to DCA at these prices until the next halving."
83-3-1,Feel that so hard m8. I am a trainee at the moment so yeah.
83-3-2,hahahaha same
83-3-4,Continue to DCA the gains will have you a tectonic cream levels in the next bull and you will be able to smear the goo of “I told you so” on the fiat monkeys who mocked you
83-3-5,you'll be happy to dca at 5k too
83-3-5-1,roughly three times as happy in fact
83-3-5-2,That means a MAJOR custodial player is crashing like CB or biance not happening
83-3-5-2-1,lol i said DCA at 5k.. not zero buddy. if asset values dropping to where they were 3 years ago kills an entire industry... then it proves my point... not lessens it.
83-5,I spent an hour transferring my little bitcoin I have on Strike to Ledger. I still get tense. I even to a small test then wait. But the second move always gets me.
83-5-2,"I used to get anxiety but nowadays I tell  myself “if I can’t get this transfer right, the whole industry is fucked anyway since it means normal folks will all just screw it up” and I just click it."
83-5-3,It's how I started small bits now I interact with ease try also buying something with it through lighting I do Lightning  is going to be huge this decade  not in Western world but poorer country's
83-5-3-1,"I just started playing with Lightening, and I’m truly impressed. Idk, we may see more adoption than we think  n the Western world, but it will be huge in developing countries, agree."
83-5-3-1-1,"Lightning really is impressive when you start using it. It's not perfect but the rate it's improving is pretty rapid. The power of open source! We're on the Isle of Man, a small island in the UK and have nearly 50 merchants from coffee shops to car dealerships accepting it. I use it often. We launched our contactless  only a few months ago and are already close to getting lightning integrated with a regular merchant POS system also running legacy Visa/Mastercard payment rails. Once the user and merchant experience becomes indistinguishable from the legacy system and merchants realize they can save 2% in fees it might not just be the developing world where this takes off. Adam @ CoinCorner"
83-5-3-1-1-1,Super cool!
83-5-3-2,That will be nice!
83-5-3-3,I totally agree. Have you tried the cashapp spending? Iva always got my eye out for it to give it a try but like you said I live in a “first world area” so adoption is slooooow but I can’t wait to try it out somewhere.
86,Bitcoin Mining powered by used cooking oil
86-1,"Wow so you eat fries to generate bitcoin to buy more fries, perfect cycle."
86-1-1,Suck it thermodynamics
86-1-1-1,No you do have a point there...hmm if only we could cook more fries from the energy wasted by the generator. Or at least somehow give the fries a delicious smokey flavor with the exhaust
86-1-1-1-1,"Well of we could do that, that's a great thing. I'd prefer that way."
86-1-1-2,"Suck in, that nanoparticulate. Cooking oils burn dirtier than diesel.Edit: spelling"
86-1-1-2-1,Contributing to that pm 2.5 baby!
86-1-1-2-2,Wrong it’s far cleaner.  There was a project that proved it at USB.  Biodiesel is the future and cost less. They tested the emissions etc.  They specifically used used oil from McDonald’s and exhaust had that recognizable McDonald’s restaurant smell
86-1-1-2-4,"Per Consumer reports testing,  cooking oil actually produced  less smog causing  NOx and particulate matter than diesel, but had slightly higher unburned hydrocarbons."
86-1-1-2-5,Burning cooking oil is carbon neutral.
86-1-1-3,Then you use the Bitcoin to buy more electricity to keep mining bitcoin
86-1-1-3-1,That’s how I paid my electricity bills since I started mining.   Then I dumped all my earnings in November peak.   I know it’s not acceptable to not HODL but a Pleb has to do what a Pleb has to don
86-1-3,Infinite Fry Glitch
86-1-3-1,"Lol, that's what the glitch is? Well I like it so far and it's good.I think this is some good stuff and could be done better here, but what do I know, I'm just sharing my opinion."
86-1-4,KABOOM!
86-1-4-1,"Yep here it goes, it's only going to get better from here."
86-2,Trailer Park Boys bitcoin mine
86-2-1,Ricky would have made HashCoin and rugpulled his first buyer
86-2-1-1,Which probably would have been himself and then he'll lose his wallet info in Ray's dump.
86-2-1-2,"Lol, he definitely got the brains to do that, he could do that."
86-2-2,"They're mining it and they're mining it good, coming for it.And you can't say that it doesn't look good, because it does look good, I'm liking what I'm seeing."
86-2-3,It's like they replaced a cocaine lab for mining
86-2-4,"If I had an award, I’d give it to this W comment "
86-3,I'm sure that chain link will do a superb job protecting the hardware from the elements.
86-3-2,"Right. At least, if BTC has actually been mined out of that setup. The Bitcoin itself is as safe as where he put his seed phrase."
86-3-2-1,"Yes, but one could very easily make a solid case that any benefits of this setup would be offset by having to replace hardware because of a rain storm."
86-3-2-1-1,"Yep, that's a good argument. I think it'll be a disaster in that situation."
86-3-2-2,"Atleast it's secure lol, gotta give it that for sure man."
86-3-3,I don't understand how that setup looks super ghetto but then the guy is wearing airpods and presumably has an iPhone?Why not use all that money to live somewhere better.
86-3-3-1,I would assume he has some kind of more robust structure in which he lives. Why he puts the rest of his gear outside is the question.
86-3-3-1-1,Optimum cooling obviously. He doesn't need any fans because he's got a natural breeze.
86-3-3-1-1-1,"Natural 85-90°F breeze, at a natural 60-70% humidity, blowing in natural dirt and natural debris into the fans and heat sinks, and the natural 10-15” inches of rainfall per month during the natural six month long rainy season all over the electronics.Plus natural access for all the natural critters to naturally chew on all the wiring because they are naturally stupid."
86-3-3-1-1-1-1,And let's not get started about how great high humidity and high-amperage DC power is for metals.
86-3-4,"Ohh yeah lol for sure, I don't have any doubts about that at all.I don't think anything bad is going to happen with it, I'm sure that it'll end up real good for sure."
86-4,"This video led me down a Saturday learning spree of 'What is Transesterification'One part i found interesting, the U.S. processes 23 billion lbs of vegetable oil into biofuel, of which 5% is used cooking oil/waste. "
86-4-2,"Yeah, biodiesel is apparently the profit motivator behind heavy soy production and subsidies in the US, even though most of it by mass goes it livestock. The like 18% that is oil makes more money than the 82% that go to other uses.  IMO flooding markets with all that extra soy mass creates perverse incentives in other industries."
86-5,Jose Rogaño de Bitcoin
