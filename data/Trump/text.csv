Jan 1865 - GEN Sherman's Field Order #15 seized 400,000 acres along coast in SC and FL and gave it to ex-slavesApril 1865 - Lincoln assassinated.March 1865 President Johnson pardons most Confederates and allows them to recover their seized land and property.Think how things would be now if former slaves -instead of the former slave OWNERS -had all that wealth to pass to their heirs.

I think I would take the land from the planters and redistribute it. Not sure what to do with the planters, I feel like hanging them or exiling them or something lol.

He also basically lost the potential business of 50% of the US as I can't imagine anyone even remotely left leaning ever doing business with him again. He dun dicked himself pretty hard there.

59-1-2-2,"I agree with you on the face of it, but I think a big part of why they didn't is because they knew there were a lot of armed people in that crowd *looking* for a reason to escalate and nowhere near enough capitol police to do anything about it with or without guns.Shooting into that push, even when justified, could have easily thrown the crowd into an even greater, consuming frenzy and escalated that situation to an even greater degree than what it already was. I do have the dark thought that maybe if it was even worse (instead of a largely impotent, self-incriminating, live-streaming event given the scale and potentiality that was there) that maybe the country as a whole would take it more seriously, but it could also have steeled those broken, conservative victim mentalities even further too.",none

So instead of competing, he just skipped them entirely choosing instead to focus on Florida, thinking that the big delegate haul there would propel him to victory.Problem there was that Florida didn’t vote until Super Tuesday and he took a string of losses in states he skipped leading up to it.
