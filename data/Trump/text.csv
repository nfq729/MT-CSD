1,FBI executes search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago
1-2,"According to Fox 11 LA, the classified documents in question regarding the search warrant have been found. That’s according to them 45 minutes ago"
1-2-1,"Who illegally removes classified documents, and stores them at home for years… and coming from a guy that ate and flushed sensitive documents…"
1-2-1-1,Someone who thinks laws are for poor people
1-2-1-1-1,Where's Rudy? How did he let these men come into my house?
1-2-1-1-1-1,He was waiting at Mar-A-Lago Total Landscaping
1-2-1-1-1-3,"Getting another hair dye from Philadelphia's underground hair dye king, Frank."
1-2-1-2,Someone who thinks he's untouchable and invincible.
1-2-2,Assuming this is trueTrump was accused of illegally moving classified documentsWe do a raid on his home and we find the exact documents we thought he stole Thats a pretty open and shut criminal case IMHO
1-2-2-1,"His fans are already trying to spin it as ""He told his people he declassified them, so they're declassified."" even though he didn't go through the actual process required for declassification. Which means they WEREN'T declassified. And even if they WERE declassified, he still had no right to hold onto them, the public would then have a right to see them all, so they should still be part of the presidential records in the archives. He doesn't get to declassify something and then keep it away from prying eyes!"
1-2-3,"Hopefully, gg"
1-3,I can’t wait for Mike Lindell to start selling MySafe after this shit.
2,2 years ago today Rudy Giuliani held a press conference for Trump at Four Seasons Total Landscaping
2-1,The fact that they made a mistake when booking it and still went with it is absolutely unreal
2-1-1,It's straight out of Veep it's so bad.
2-1-1-1,I'm not sure even the Veep writers would have been able to come up with this gag. Or at least they would've thrown the idea out as too implausible.
2-1-1-1-1,"It feels like Arrested Development's early seasons. It works with jokes like ""loose seal"" and ""business model."""
2-1-1-1-1-1,"It's so implausible that if I'd seen it in a movie or on TV, I actually wouldn't have found it funny. It's not funny if it's scripted because it's so ridiculous. The fact that it actually happened makes it... transcendently comedic."
2-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Thank you, That’s the right word"
2-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"The day it happened, I was about ready to get religious again. I had a brief few hours where I was considering that there might really be a god afterall and he/she/it/they had the same sense of humor as me. Transcendent."
2-1-1-1-2,"This event proved God's existence, because the comedy is too perfect."
2-1-1-1-2-1,Or that God doesn't exist because there is nothing intelligent about this design 
2-1-1-1-3,"If I were watching a political comedy and there was a plotline about someone working for the President booking a press conference at Four Seasons Landscaping instead of the Four Seasons hotel, I’d shut it off in frustration and watch something else. Nobody is that useless!"
2-1-1-2,Gives me Parks & Rec vibes too but for them it would be reasonable
2-1-2,"I like to imagine the conversation:  Rudy: ""What the fuck is *this?""*  Aide: ""Sir, apparently there was a mixup. We thou-""  Rudy: ""A *fucking mixup???* We can't do it *here!*""  Aide: ""Sir, we have to. All the major networks moved their programming to accommodate this. There's no turning back.""  Rudy: {sweats hair dye}"

2-1-2-3,"Aide: Sir, but we did get a good deal, at least 25% off their initial asking price. Really stuck to our guns. Way below the average rate for The Four Seasons, we could even work it into the script.Aide 2: yes, we know all Americans are tired of just fantasizing about of the American Dream, but instead are getting reamed out behind a crematorium.Rudy: …"
2-1-2-3-1,Aide 3 to Aide 1: Price doesnt really matter we arent going to pay them anyway.
2-1-2-4,"Rudy: ""think Rudy, think! How can 9/11 get me outta this one?"""
2-1-3,I wonder if they admitted it was a mistake. But I don't believe they have the ability to admit even the most obvious mistakes.
2-1-3-1,"To this day, no."
2-1-3-1-1,"I love the implication that if they didn't make a mistake, they legitimately and purposely booked the press conference in the dirt lot of a random small landscaping company.  They're trying to pass it off like that was the decision they legitimately made, which is hilarious."
2-1-3-1-1-1,"It's amazing that a sizable chunk of the country saw the president's lawyer dripping hair dye in a parking lot for a landscaping firm between a crematorium and a dildo store and thought ""Yup, nothing weird here; these people should definitely run this country."""
2-1-3-1-1-1-1,My only wish is that there was a photo of RG with the dildo store in the background.
2-1-3-1-1-1-1-1,Doing the deep shirt-tuck.
2-1-3-1-1-1-2,">""Yup, nothing weird here; these people should definitely run this country.""It really goes to show how little value people place on the skill required to run a successful government.  And then on the flipside, you get some politicians are considered ""policy wonks"" because they discuss the fine detail of policy and its implications.  Shouldn't that be the ideal that all candidates aspire to, rather than an oddity that deserves a slightly derisive name?"
2-1-3-1-1-1-2-1,"Yeah, for some reason the right started leaning into the idea of intelligence being a negative quality for politicians, and somehow their base ate it up"
2-1-3-1-1-2,"> They're trying to pass it off like that was the decision they legitimately made, which is hilarious.This sums up the entire Trump administration, 2017-2021."
2-1-3-1-1-2-1,covfefe
2-1-3-1-1-3,"Honestly, it's not *that* weird. As a contrast between ""Real Americans"" and ""Coastal Liberal Elites"" it'd be an incredibly potent bit of messaging. The real issue is that we don't trust the team behind it to be that canny; it being a mistake feels much more likely. But some other campaign? It'd have been right on brand for Bush Jr, just the right combination of goofy and folksy. McCain? Definitely in the realm of possibility. Romney? It would have been painfully awkward pandering, but without a doubt intentional."
2-1-3-1-1-4,"Imagine how much worse it could have been if they had a modicum of strategic talent and leaned into the mistake scheduling public events at small businesses nationwide under the guise of ""speaking to the common man""."
2-1-3-1-1-5,"There's exactly zero parts of this statement that aren't completely and totally accurate. This is exactly what happened and it's not even ""technically what happened"". This happened, full stop, exactly as you said. They did it to avoid having to admit they didn't clear the booking with the real Four Seasons first and for no other reason.It tracks perfectly with the conservative game plan when you think about it. Never admit you were wrong, double down. ""Alternative facts""."
2-1-3-2,"Honestly under different circumstances I *could* have seen it as an intentional move - like ""look - all the out of touch people would have done it at a five star hotel, *we* are the down-to-earth ones, our Four Seasons is a small business bc we are For The People.""But they didn't even try to play that angle. They just acted like nothing was off at all"
2-1-3-2-1,"I would have spun it more like ""here at the humble business of your average guy""."
2-1-3-3,"Like the hurricane black marker thing. And they call liberals ""sensitive snowflakes""."
2-1-3-4,They should have. They could've easily said they fucked up and went with it and thanked them for accommodating them and made it into some bullshit community event.
2-1-5,"There was no mistake. Twice impeached trump stated he would hold a press conference at the Four Seasons. Four Seasons told him go f*** yourself, you’re not holding anything here. So dumb-dumb’s campaign held the press conference at Four Seasons Landscaping to save face."
2-1-5-1,"yup, he already tweeted out ""its at the Four Seasons!"" before they even bothered asking the venue, and they were told no so they had to find ANYTHING with Four Seasons in the name, because trump would sooner die than admit he made a mistake."
2-1-5-1-1,"If only he had said the Four Seasons Hotel. Damn, they would have then claimed the landscaping business operates a hotel on the side."
2-1-5-2,>held the press conference at Four Seasons Landscaping to save face.And it totally worked! /sTruly the party of Lawn and Order
2-1-5-3,Honestly if they had just done it anywhere else no one would’ve really cared- maybe laughed at the fact that 4 seasons wouldn’t take them- but that’s it. This shit is going to be in history textbooks
2-1-5-4,"Like they literally could have tweeted an ""oops"" with a correction to a different legit venue and yet they still thought that would be more embarrassing than this fever dream of an alternative."
2-2,Greatest Press Conference in the history of press conferences. Really won that day.
2-2-1,"I LOVE that the business didn't correct them. Just ""yep, you can do that here"". Then later made shirts. I would LOVE to have been in the office when that call came in"
2-2-1-1,"I probably would have thought it was a prank call at first.I'd tell myself, ""no one can be this dumb"". And then I'd ask who I'm speaking to. When they say ""Rudy G. the former mayor of New York"", I'd say, ""say no more, I believe you"". And of course I let them go through with it because it was/is absolutely hilarious. I would love the opportunity to dunk on Trump while also making him pay me to do it."
2-2-1-1-1,I'm honestly disappointed they didn't have some guy ride through the middle of the press conference on a ride-on lawnmower and dump a load of clippings behind Rudy
2-2-1-1-1-1,Fertilizer should have had a dump truck lay down so fertilizer
2-2-1-1-1-1-1,"That beep beep sound getting ever closer.Biff is Trump, Trump is Biff, and [manure…..]"
2-2-1-1-2,If he pays up at all
2-2-1-1-2-1,He could do it for free if I owned it. I mean honestly it’s worth it to watch the president of the US show up to my landscaping company to hold a press conference because Rudy G couldn’t figure out it was a landscaping company. Like my god it’s absolutely perfect.
2-2-1-1-2-1-1,"I don't think it was Rudy not realizing he'd fucked up. It was *Trump* saying that they'd ""have a press conference at the Four Sessons"", and then the hotel was like ""Nah fam"", and Rudy had to make it so Trump ""hadn't lied when he said it'd be at the Four Seasons""."
2-2-1-1-2-1-1-1,I'm so glad Trump is such a soldier for the truth? /s
2-2-1-3,I bet that business is booming now.
2-2-1-3-1,They made almost 2 million just from T-shirts
2-2-1-3-1-1,They’ve also hosted some concerts and shows there. They’re loving it.
2-2-1-3-1-1-1,Holy shit is that true? What a lovely opportunistic cash grab!
2-2-1-3-1-2,Probably the biggest thing Trump did for the working man while in office.
2-2-1-5,Just wore my shirt the other day lol. It’s fun how it blends with others when it’s one of the biggest campaign gaffs in recent memory
2-2-2,So good. The hair dye really put a bow on it too.Edit: And the fact that it was near a sex shop and a crematorium. And they had a convicted sex offender speak for them.
2-2-2-1,More incredibly it was during this conference that the election result was officially called for Biden
2-2-2-1-1,"""Networks don't decide the results, Courts do.""I love how mask off he was right there. It wasn't the voters and the people aggregating the results. It was the courts that they stacked they were openly relying on."
2-2-2-1-2,"thanks for ripping off the scab.  Everything he said during that press conference seemed totally reasonable to me, and time has just bolstered my feeling that the democrats totally cheated, and that was a juiced election if I ever saw one."
2-2-2-1-2-3,"I love it. I genuinely find it hilarious that people have this perspective, whether or not you in particular are trolling. America is just this caricature of itself nowadays"
2-2-2-2,Thank Frank Reynolds for that
2-2-2-3,I just hope Borats daughter is ok
2-2-2-5,It wasn’t hair dye…. It was credibility. Just escaping from the body.
2-2-2-5-1,That's impossible since it would mean he had some credibility left at that point.
2-2-3,It really summed up the 2020 Republican campaign for me
2-2-3-1,"74 million Americans want this shit show to continue.And good chunk would murder for it. Its sad, funny and so utterly grotesque."
2-2-5,Bigly!
2-3,You can get a thousand comedy writers working for a thousand years and they will never come up with anything as funny as this.
2-3-1,It’s one of those things that I can’t believe actually happened. It’s literally an Onion article come to life.
2-3-1-1,The onion writers probably suffered over the last few years. Really tough to keep the imagination ahead of the game.
2-3-1-1-1,When the Onion writers wrote a brief to the Supreme Court regarding satire being protected speech they listed their ability to correctly predict the future as one of their qualifications.
2-3-1-1-1-1,How about Charlie Brooker correctly predicting David Cameron’s pig sex antics…
2-3-1-1-1-1-1,That was a rumor kinda thing about Cameron's time in college. It's not like he made the Black mirror episode and then Cameron went to town on a pig
2-3-1-1-1-1-2,Or the parallels of the Waldo moment and trump’s election
2-3-1-1-1-1-2-1,It's crazy how Trump's election made that episode simultaneously better *and* worse in retrospect.  Better because it no longer seemed like a wholly implausible scenario. Worse because it's traumatic to watch.
2-3-1-1-1-4,"The amicus brief they filed is absolutely worth the read. It's relevant again right now as Elon is suspending accounts that mock him if they don't explicitly say they are parody. EDIT: And turns out suspending even the ones that did.> I. Parody Functions By Tricking People Into Thinking That It Is Real  > II. Because Parody Mimics “The Real Thing,” It Has The Unique Capacity To Critique The Real Thing  > III. A Reasonable Reader Does Not Need A Disclaimer To Know That Parody Is Parody  > IV. It Should Be Obvious That Parodists Cannot Be Prosecuted For Telling A Joke With A Straight Face  "
2-3-1-1-3,"Republicans Elect Game Show Host as... No, wait.President Asks Why We Seriously Can't Use Nukes... Wait, shit.Actual Nazi Runs for State... Eh, fuck. Fuck.There's nothing. We got nothing."
2-3-1-1-4,"The writers for Veep spoke about how challenging it was.They designed their show to not feel biased toward any specific political side, careful to avoid scenarios too close to reality. However, they ran into problems where they'd film their president doing something asinine only for Trump to go ahead and do the same thing."
2-3-1-4,I can't believe that NOBODY that supports trump even cared. At a certain point they must know how awful and ridiculous Trump's administration was...right?
2-3-1-5,"I could totally imagine this being in something like Arrested Development.  I'd laugh at it but never really think it was actually possible.  Yet here we are, we actually live in this timeline.  A comedy sketch timeline."
2-3-2,"If I hadn't lived through it, I would never believe it actually happened. I thought I was hallucinating when it went down."
2-3-2-1,Rudi would be such a great arrested development character
2-3-2-1-1,Is he not just George Bluth Sr?
2-3-2-1-1-1,"Nah, he was actually vaguely intelligent.Giuliani is like a partner at Barry Zuckerkorn's law firm."
2-3-2-1-1-1-2,"Oh he founded that firm, gave Barry his job but was then ousted. Mainly for being a really bad lawyer but also because of the… incident."
2-3-2-1-4,They would probably get criticised because the character would be too over the top and unrealistic.
2-3-2-2,"I remember following it quite early on when the location had been announced by Trump's team on Twitter (?), trying to find livestreams of anyone who'd actually got there, and looking at it on Street View incredulously. There were a couple of streamers nosing around filming the gates and the yard through the fence, although nothing had been set up yet, and it seemed like it was just a mistake.Half an hour or so later we checked back in and they'd set up the lectern and backdrop. It was really going ahead! We were crying laughing."
2-3-2-2-1,"i watched trump delete the tweet announcing it was at the 4 seasons hotel, and then they announced it was at the landscaping place. just such a fucking clown car of shit those 4 years were. I honestly just cant believe it was all real still today."
2-3-2-2-1-1,"The incompetant, seditious, and treasonous clown car of shit wants to return.  Please vote against anyone who stands for that."
2-3-2-2-1-2,"Despite all that, which I agree with 100%, you can bet that unless he drops dead beforehand, he will run in 2024 (he absolutely cannot resist the attention he would get), and he will win, because people are stupid and they'll incorrectly judge the scale of ""I'm annoyed with the fringe leftist obsessions"" and ""the other party wants to install themselves as permanent idiot kings"" to be close enough to evil, but the economy's iffy right now, so, ""better to switch ruling parties just in case that helps."""
2-3-2-4,"People used the phrase ""satire is dead"" quite a bit during TFG's administration, but for me, this was it. This was the line. The peak. The day the comedy died, so to speak - because nothing could ever top this event. I still can't believe they were so stubborn and so unwilling to admit making a mistake that they *went ahead with the press conference in front of a landscaping company they had clearly mistaken for a hotel*.Kind of the perfect encapsulation of Trumpist thought"
2-3-5,"The location, the juxtaposition of the sex shop, the dripping hair dye. Political satire is ruined forever because of this."
2-3-5-1,The hair dye was a different event.  Giuliani was the gift that just kept giving.
2-3-5-1-1,"Oh man, you're right. You'll have to excuse my chronology error, the whole thing felt like a fever dream to me"
2-5,This was a true Spinal Tap moment. Absolutely beyond parody. Unfathomably absurd.
2-5-2,It’s all funny until these people take over the government after tomorrow.  It’s beyond absurd there’s so many people ready to vote for this insanity again.
2-5-3,Rudy turned it up to 11.
3,Former President Donald Trump invokes Fifth Amendment rights and declines to answer questions from NY attorney general
3-1,"“I’m being attacked from all sides. We’ve never seen anything like it, it’s terrible. You know they’re investigating me about my beautiful real estate, what a sham. It’s a disgrace. I told them I’m pleading the fifth. It has to be done. Truly, must be done, to protect the patriots all around this country.“"
3-1-1,...is that a real quote? I can never tell with trump
3-1-1-1,It's real.
3-1-1-1-1,Oh fuck. I thought it was a joke. Jesus fucking Christ.Edit: lol I see what autocorrect did and I’m keeping it.
3-1-2,">Truly, must be done, to protect the patriots all around this country.“Fucking lol. You know idiots actually eat this shit up"
3-1-2-1,[And then some]. This shit is scary dude.
3-1-2-1-1,"How do you reconcile with people like this? They need therapits or something, I don't know. Is that wrong of me to say? Personally, I think everyone needs a therapist sometimes but these people, like, *really* need someone to sit them down and help them sort out reality."
3-1-2-2,Protecting myself protects all the patriots in the country.
3-1-2-2-1,Hes the only one makes sense
3-1-2-4,100% cult leader talk right there.
3-2,"The guy who said only mobsters take the fifth, took the fifth."
3-2-1,"He also said ""If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment."""
3-2-1-1,Hypocrisy is the native tongue of the Trumpster.
3-2-1-1-2,It's not hypocritical at all. He said you only take the fifth if you're guilty....
3-2-1-1-3,All Republicans. It’s because it’s an authoritarian movement. They WANT different rules to apply to different people.
3-2-2,Trump = Walmart mobster.
3-2-3,I don't think this case proves him wrong. Donny's in deep with the Russians.
3-2-3-1,I have to wonder if that isn't why the DOJ went full board getting the WH documents back. I would not be surprised if Trump sold US info to other countries. I wouldn't be surprised if he already has and the DOJ was tipped off about it.
3-2-3-1-1,This. But don already poked the bear that is the intelligence community half way throu his term. He made enemies of all the wrong people and friends of none of the right people...
3-3,"Ohhh, so he is capable of shutting the fuck up."
3-3-1,"I doubt it. He *~~plead~~ pleaded* the 5th, but I doubt he's actually going to stop talking."
3-3-1-1,"""I plead the fifth, which is a thing I'm told I can do, the fifth what I don't know but that's what you have to say, that you plead it. And I do. Plead it. Plead the fifth. I had a friend, great guy, he tried to plead the fourth, I said Bobby, that's not a thing you can do but he still wanted to do it anyway..."""
3-3-1-1-1,"""He came to me with tears in his eyes and said 'Sir, you're the greatest pleader of the 5th I've ever seen.'"""
3-3-1-1-1-1,"My lawyer, very competent man, went to Princeton, which is not as good as Harvard, which is where I went by the way, not as good as Harvard but still pretty good. My lawyer, a very good lawyer, he told me I’m the best client he has ever worked with. And it’s true! Ask any lawyer, and I know many of them! They will all say the same things about me. Very talented client, knows all what to say, never makes mistakes. Folks, I know you’re not supposed to brag, but what can I say! I’m a perfect client."
3-3-1-1-1-1-1,"I hate how easy it is to *hear his fucking voice* when reading these. Even when I type them myself, I hear them in his voice."
3-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,"""I don't think I need to tell you, folks, but I'm the pleader everyone else wants to be. I can tell you that...it's been told to me, folks, great people have told me I can plead like nobody's business. Like NOBODY'S BUSINESS. And I know business, folks. I know business. I can nobody a business like nobody else, alright? That's right. That's right."""
3-3-1-1-1-2,"The ""came up to me and said 'sir...' "" are my favorite!"
3-3-1-1-1-2-1,You can tell it is true because of the Sir.
3-3-1-1-1-2-1-1,">You can tell it is true because of the Sir.My theory is that it actually happened a handful of times and it's the best he's ever felt about himself, so now he uses it in his lies to give himself more confidence in them."
3-3-1-1-2,It’s amazing how incoherent random rambling immediately puts his voice in your mind. I think I’m scarred for life.
3-3-1-1-2-1,I'm not even American but I can hear it perfectly fucking kill me
3-3-1-1-2-1-1,Welcome to our nightmare
3-3-1-1-2-2,And millions of voters decided they want the leader of the free world to spew word salad.
3-3-1-1-3,"A guy came up to me, big strong guy, this guy came up to me with tears in his eyes, and said ""Sir, sir you have to plead the fifth. We couldn't stand to see them get you like this, so please just take the fifth."" And you know what? Maybe I will. Maybe I won't feel so good about it, but I might just have to do it."
3-3-1-2,Well these are his lawyers talking right now. I’m sure Trump will put his foot in his mouth when the time comes.
3-3-1-2-1,Not if his representation is Rudy again. Talk about the dynamic duo of incoherent bullshit
3-3-1-3,"But can you truly blame him? He has words. He has the best words, after all. A stable genius with big, strong hands. You WISH you'd be him."
3-3-2,Is he still banned on Twitter? If so they can reinstate his privileges and we could bet on when he will incriminate himself.I say 48 hours.
3-3-2-1,"He has ""Truth social"", his own platformThat being said, twitter banning his account immediately after the jan 6 was the best thing they ever did for him, because he 100% would've self incriminated in that timespan."
3-3-2-1-1,That's gotta be the most geriatric name for a social media platform I've ever heard of. Yeesh
3-3-2-1-1-1,"Even better, they basically just ripped off the Twitter layout and design, but replaced ""tweet"" with ""truth"". It's the ""we have Twitter at home"" social media platform."
3-3-2-1-1-1-2,Not Twitter at home 
3-4,"""You see the mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"" -Donald Trump, 9/28/2016 rally, Iowa"
3-4-1,"[another source with a bunch of times he's criticized others for taking the 5th]edit: Since this blew up I'll post the original tweet I got this video from, [this is from 2018]for those unable to see, the tweet says >If Donald Trump pleads the Fifth, don't let him forget all of this"
3-4-1-1,"Wait, does he think pleading the 5th just means you're immune from charges?"
3-4-1-1-1,"""I declare the 5th Amendment!"""
3-4-1-1-1-1,"That only works with bankruptcy, sorry.[Source]"
3-4-1-1-1-1-1,He’s done that too!
3-4-1-1-1-1-1-1,Six times. Declaring bankruptcy at his numerous failed business ventures is one of his rare specialties.
3-4-1-1-1-2,"Michael, you can’t just declare “5th amendment” and all your problems go away."
3-4-1-1-1-2-1,"“5th amendment”, Donald, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start. It's a clean slate."
3-4-1-1-1-3,"You can't just say ""5th Amendment"" and expect anything to happen."
3-4-1-1-1-3-1,"I didn't say it, I declared it"
3-4-1-1-2,He doesn't think.
3-4-1-1-2-1,"Only time [he DOESN'T talk], so not sure if people should savor the moment or roast him for it.  It got a lot more quiet after he was kicked from Twitter."
3-4-1-1-2-1-1,"Should roast him for it considering he basically (paraphrasing) said ""only guilty people plead the fifth""."
3-4-1-1-3,"He genuinely doesn't seem to know what the 5th amendment is. I think he's essentially just done the judicial equivalent of roaring ""I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!"""
3-4-1-1-4,"Yes, maybe, probably, who knows! I think his attorneys are just amazed that he is finally listening to them."
3-4-1-1-4-2,"This right here. Nobody should be surprised that the coward is doing something in his own self-interest, but I'm surprised that the twice-impeached loser finally learned how to shut his mouth."
3-4-1-1-5,"Because he's used slimy legal tactics to avoid any consequences so far in a life full of scams, fraud, and all sorts of mobster behavior. And it's worked. In the legal system he is subject to (not the legal system we have access to), powerful people can use general fuckery, chicanery, and indignant outrage, and these are all reasonable types of defenses."

He's such a clown it's hilarious that people believe him at all.

3-4-1-4-1,I don’t know who wrote the letter for him but it’s fascinating how they always chain the nation to Trump’s personal problems. This forced merge is the trick to manipulating the cult members to keep donating because they feel victimized too.
3-4-1-5,He’s also said on multiples occasions that he thinks someone under investigation by the FBI isn’t fit to be president. Let’s make sure he remembers this in another year when he starts campaigning.
3-4-2,"""I was the most transparent — and am — transparent president in history."""
3-4-2-1,He's transparent alright

This was said with a straight face in a room full of doctors addressing the covid emergency. That's the full quote. I didn't snip and move parts. He said these words. And while rambling and barely coherent, the intent is clear."
3-4-3-1-1-1,Wasn‘t that the same visit where he shared the fact that he knew so much about the virus that the scientists praised him for it?

3-4-5-1,Oh you know he was in bed with the mob big time. To be in real estate in New York back then? Fuggedabowdit. And when the Italian mob got hammered he just got in bed with the Russians. Which brings us to Giuliani. Some people think it's a little suspicious that after going so hard against the old Italian syndicates that he would be so close with the Russians that came in to fill the vacuum. 
3-5,"His options appear to have been: 1. Perjury.2. Admit crime.3. Plead the Fifth.If I were in his shoes, I'd have done the same thing. I'm not in his shoes, however, because I don't commit tax crimes."
3-5-1,"This is absolutely it, laid out succinctly. Unless he wanted to commit new crimes or admit to old crimes, this was the only option.Given that the FBI just raided him and took evidence, he has a lot of fresh reasons to be protective."

3-5-1-2-2,"Not for Trump. He has no self discipline. Even on Jan 6 when lawyers and staffers were warning him of his criminal liability he still had a really hard time delivering scripted lines about the election. He just can’t not lie. It’s his entire ethos.If his lawyers had encouraged him to say anything other than the 5th, he would have gone off the rails. It was a smart call on their part.I mean, it’s not a winning strategy. But given the circumstances it’s the least likely way to cause more damage."
3-5-1-2-2-1,I think this is a big part of it. Every second he speaks is a massive liability when under oath.

4-1-1-5,">Various classified/TS/SCI documentsApparently SCI is ""above Top Secret” [source]"
4-1-1-5-1,"SCI or ""Sensitive Compartmented Information” is not a level of clearance. SCI grants access to certain information, such as intelligence sources, methods, or analytical processes.Top Secret information can be compartmentalized so only those with a need to know are allowed access."
4-1-1-5-2,Not quite but close.  SCI can exist as both Secret SCI and Top Secret SCI.  Secret SCI is between Secret Collateral and Top Secret Collateral.  Top Secret SCI is above Top Secret Collateral but most Top Secrets information is Top Secret SCI so in practice Top Secret SCI is just a longer name for Top Secret.
4-1-1-5-2-1,"SCI is ""Sensitive Compartmented Information”Don't know what this ""collateral"" you mention.*Information ""above Top Secret,"" a phrase used by the media, means either Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Program (SAP). It is not truly ""above"" Top Secret, since there is no clearance higher than Top Secret. SCI information may be either Secret or Top Secret, but in either case it has additional controls on dissemination beyond those associated with the classification level alone*"
4-1-1-5-2-1-1,"Collateral information in the US classification system is any national security information classified as TS, S, or C that is not in the SCI or SAP category. Basically, classified info that doesn’t require any addition security protections above the normal TS/S/C protocols for documents."
4-1-1-5-3,"Ugh, it's not. Didn't even read the source you posted. It's more similar to a ""need to know"" any level of Classified, Secret or TS can be SCI. It just means you need to be read in to a certain thing to get access to SCI."
4-1-1-5-3-1,"I read it, but am not an expert so perhaps I misunderstood“Above top secret” comes from that wiki and [this] article says ""some of the materials recovered were marked as ‘top secret/SCI’ -- one of the highest levels of classification”"
4-1-1-5-3-1-1,"“Above top secret” is close enough. SCI clearance requires additional vetting beyond just top secret but it’s not much more and is usually accomplished much faster than the TS clearance investigation. For all intents and purposes, what you said is correct though. Don’t let the muggles get you down!"
4-1-1-5-3-1-1-1,"It's not though. They are not the same, SCI is a special access modifier."
4-1-1-5-3-1-2,"I think a helpful clarification as to why some people describe it as ""above TS"" is the intent of SCI. Requiring a need-to-know to be read in ensures that there are as few eyes on the material as necessary. This means that even if the SCI document is otherwise only protected at the confidential or secret level (as opposed to top secret), generally fewer people will be able to access it.The confusing part is that truthfully you always need to have a need-to-know for any classified document. SCI just makes you prove it by having someone authorize your read in."
4-1-1-5-3-1-3,"> SCI is not a classification. SCI clearance has sometimes been called ""above Top Secret,""[2] but information at any classification level may exist within an SCI control system. It literally says in the wiki that it's called that but it's not correct. You can have Secret/SCI and Classified/SCI.A better explanation> Information ""above Top Secret,"" a phrase used by the media, means either Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Program (SAP). It is not truly ""above"" Top Secret, since there is no clearance higher than Top Secret. SCI information may be either Secret or Top Secret, but in either case it has additional controls on dissemination beyond those associated with the classification level alone. In order to gain SCI Access, one would need to have a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). Compartments of information are identified by code words. This is one means by which the ""need to know"" principle is formally and automatically enforced."

Cue Michael Scott's ""I declare Bankruptcy"" scene from The Office."
4-2-1,The Trump supporters will say that anything Trump took is by definition declassified.
4-2-1-1,He could theoretically make that kind of argument for normal classified documents. The kind they said they found in the receipt are way beyond top secret and have special rules for declassification
4-2-1-1-1,"And none of it even matters. The Espionage Act just says documents related to the defense of the country, etc. Doesn't differentiate with classifications."
4-2-1-1-1-1,"That's the best news of all. Declassified or not, none of that matters with the 3 potential charges."
4-3,NYT says that DOJ also has subpoenaed surveillance footage of the storage area at Mar-a-Lago to see who’s been able to access the documents that were stashed there. That’s pretty juicy.Edited:typo
4-4,"Trump isn't denying it, he's claiming it shouldn't be a big deal because Obama received 33 million pages of documents after leaving the Whte House... which the National Archives immediately countered with legal clarification about how those materials were given by the national archives to his Presidential Library."
4-4-1,Not given to Obama. The National Archives owns and operates the Presidential libraries.Obama's Presidential records have been in the physical custody of the National Archives since the day he left office.
4-4-1-1,All that will be in the Trump Presidential Library is a copy of Grumpy Monkey.
4-4-1-1-1,And his sharpie'd edits and that crayon drawing.
4-4-1-2,I’m just imagining that Trumps national library would be full of pop-up books and crayons.
4-4-2,Actually it appears he's now claiming that he declassified everything already. How about that. This guy has got spin for days
4-4-2-1,"A counter-point is that the espionage act doesn't distinguish between classified and unclassified documents.[The Espionage Act, for instance, does not distinguish between classified and declassified materials – unauthorized retention of any document relevant to the statute remains a crime.]"
4-4-2-1-1,I will keep this in mind whenever anyone tries to bring up that unclassified talking point.
4-4-2-1-1-1,Be sure to also bring up that the President cannot and has never been capable of declassify top secret nuclear documents. There's no argument at all to be made.
4-4-2-1-1-1-1,>Be sure to also bring up that the President cannot and has never been capable of declassify nuclear documents.They are being told.  They don't care and are calling that fake without taking any time to fact check it.
4-4-2-1-1-1-1-1,"But keep saying it.This is the trick they use. If they deny something enough, they trick the opposition into being like ""well assuming that is true, then still..."" and each time you do that, your arguments get weaker until they bring you all the way down to their level."
4-4-2-1-1-1-2,"Even if he could, he has to go through the process of actually declassifying them. He clearly didn't do that here."
4-4-2-1-1-1-2-2,"And during his presidency, not after."
4-4-2-1-2,"A sane-ish person would go from ""So what if I had the documents?

4-4-2-2,">NONE of the 3 crimes cited in the warrant turn on whether the information is classified.So that whole point is regardless, Trump is literally just an idiot regardless.Also you can't declassify Nuclear secrets so his defence is irrelevant if he even tries to argue his point."

People are just giving me money and I don't have to give them anything in return!"" And he started to believe his own bullshit."
5-2-4-2-2,It was definitely a “The Plot Against America” thing.
5-2-4-2-3,Yeah that election day picture of him and Melania not looking thrilled when the news came in of winning springs to mind.
5-2-4-2-3-1,He's smart enough to know how stupid people are.
5-2-4-2-4,Pure unrestrained ego.  He got his feelings hurt when Obama roasted him pretty brutally ( which he deserved for lying about the birth certificate stuff)
5-2-4-3,Is this how knockoff Steven Spielberg got famous on /r/whitepeopletwitter? Seems like half the posts there these days are from this one not really famous guy.
5-2-4-3-1,He’s not even funny. I dislike trump but my god that guy tweets about him and only him. He’s equally as pathetic.
5-2-4-4,"Can't even get incest right, what a wannabe."
5-2-5,"I think it's funny when big cases like this happen and regular people get a glance at how the legal system really works. This is a totally normal thing to do that happens in thousands of cases every day probably. It's how people get away/get off easy with henious shit all the time, especially white collar crime. But you gotta have $$ for a lawyer that can argue that effectively."
5-3,I don’t quite understand how someone can be affiliated with so many convicted people / coworkers / associates yet continue to avoid prosecution himself despite having a continuous stream of illegal actions filed against him
5-3-1,"I recently watched the Enron documentary (the [whole thing] is online and I highly recommend it, it's fascinating, and I'm not usually a documentary fan.) I'd say other people who responded to you made a good point- he doesn't win, he stays just ahead of the consequences. The entire Enron business model ran the same way. And one striking thing I got from the documentary. Enron was celebrated, there was tons of press from legitimate sources about what a successful company it was, what a good investment, etc. But it turned out that nobody could quite pin down exactly where all the money was coming from. An investigative reporter started pulling at the thread. And then it collapsed REALLY quickly. iirc one exec killed himself and a few others are in jail. Thousands of people lost their jobs and/or savings in essentially an instant.So... I'm hopeful that the other side of ""how is he still going"" is ""the fall is inevitable and will be shockingly quick"""
5-3-1-1,"I remember reading in Time magazine or something, before Enron collapsed, about how they grew so fast and yadda yadda yadda. But it never said what Enron actually *did*. It seemed super shady and I was like, 16 at the time."
5-3-1-1-1,"Enron had the same strategy that worked for Madoff. They convinced the public that normal people were literally too stupid to comprehend what he was doing. Financial investors in turn tried to figure it out, couldn’t, and decided that Enron was right, that they were too stupid, and to just trust Enron and the market.One of the best examples of this strategy was Enrons CEO Jeff Skiling saying “Fuck you” when asked a very simple question at a press conference…that was towards they end when everyone in the industry started waking up This is why accountants like me have literally had the concept of “professional skepticism” carved into us. You’re literally not allowed to believe you’re too stupid to understand something. Enron and Worldcom, and the resulting collapse of Andersen traumatized the entire profession."
5-3-2,"Trump is very good at stalling. His whole life is staying just one step ahead of the law. He never plays to win, he plays to see another day. But, fuck with his money and you fuck with his ability to pay for lawyers."
5-3-2-1,"Yeah, you saw this in a handful of pieces on him in 2016 where in the 70s and 80s he would hire contractors and then not pay. And when he was taken to court the contractors would eventually drop the case because they couldn't afford their lawyer anymore"
5-3-2-1-2,"Or in some cases, the contractor would get an offer for a third of what they were originally promised, and just settle so they can pay their workers and their debts. Guess that's the american way?"
5-3-2-1-2-1,Even more stupid was there was a contractor who got stiffed by Trump and still voted for him.
5-3-2-1-2-1-1,He hates the same people they do.
5-3-2-1-2-1-1-1,"""He won't let immigrants steal the job that he's not paying me for!"""
5-3-2-1-3,"He tried this on my father-in-law (a lifelong Republican, only non-R vote was for Hillary in 2016) on a security contract for some apartment buildings Trump owned in Queens.  Father-in-law and his partner were security consultants, they designed the security systems, sensors, cameras, staffing, set the whole thing up...and Trump simply refused to pay.  He figured, they wouldn't have the money to sue, and he was right.What Trump didn't figure is that they were both hardasses who have a chip on their shoulder, so they went about fully dismantling cameras, lock sensors, etc...they were maybe an hour in before Trump caved and cut the check."
5-3-2-1-3-1,"> and Trump simply refused to payA lot of things really blow my mind about the trump era, and so much of it centers around this.Trump is a well-known for being a con man.  Like, really well known.  There are countless stories like this.  Which begs a couple simple questions.How did working-class America come to support a man who represents everything they (supposedly) hate? He's a coastal elite con man.  He lives in a golden penthouse in NYC.  Small-town America should be gagging at his very existence.And two, how did the other Republicans (during the primary), and later Hillary, not jam this fact down everyone's throat?  There should have been a never-ending parade of everyone he ever screwed on television, making sure that every voter knew what a lowlife he is.(And sure, plenty of voters like him because he's a lowlife, but not nearly enough to get him elected.)"
5-3-2-1-3-1-2,"Work construction in Canada. Former coworker LOVESSSSSS Trump. Loves, loves, loves him. Heard allll about how GREAT he is for the working man, construction in particular, how he's done so much for black people, librul women are ugly thats why you dont see ugly female Trump supprters, cant remember how but he tried to make Trumps comment about dating his daughter not pervy and gross idek. Yadda fucking yadda ya at the lunch table everyday the whole time. I will never understand it either. Brilliant propaganda I have to say however to make anyone think Trump is a legitimate businessman who is good for literally anything but padding the wrong peoples pockets."
5-3-2-1-4,"I suppose I'm not sure if it's necessarily ""he doesn't pay his lawyers"" anymore (although it might be).But I just always see the kind of bozos he gets to represent himself these days, and I get the impression that this is someone who has burned a metric fuckton of bridges.What other explanation is there? I don't really buy the ""Trump is unsavory "" argument. These are lawyers. Representation is not personal endorsement. Certainly for every 10 of them who soapbox about how they'd ""never do that"", there's gotta be one of them who would. He has to either not pay, or he's doing something privately that turns away the respectable ones."
5-3-2-1-4-1,"I'm pretty sure he's a terrible client and doesn't listen to legal advice. Clients like that make it nearly impossible to make progress and having conversations with them is about as productive as banging your head on a wall.  Also, generally, professionals don't like having clients who throw temper tantrums or insist that they can do something cause Fox News said so."
5-3-3,"It's a shell game. He just tries to keep things moving. ""I can't do this because I am already being sued by them, that has to be resolved first... I would love to show you my taxes, but I'm being audited... You can't look at the documents because I need a special master..."" I mean he has run out of credible lawyers a while ago and he has too many spinning plates as of now. He already tried to settle this one. There is a Congressional Hearing on January 6th, this lawsuit plus its criminal referral, pending criminal investigation in Georgia, and so many more. His lawyers are being sanctioned for lying, his isn't winning his cases, Bannon is facing charges once again. Justice is coming, it will likely be inadequate, but it is coming."
5-3-3-1,Yeah at this point the only winning strategy is running him dry of his resources and time. He can't keep stalling if he doesn't have the money to keep fighting dozens of lawsuits over multiple years
5-3-3-1-1,His supporters will happily send him their last dollar to support his legal fees.
5-3-3-1-1-1,"Shrug, let them bankrupt themselves along with their hero."
5-3-4,"Trump is basically king of the idiots. He's like this giant candle that all the grifters, charlatans, and criminals can flock to like moths. Eventually they all go down in flames chasing money and fame. His associates go down because (i) trump sells them out to keep himself afloat, (ii) they make a mistake the feds can pounce on before they are able to achieve Trump's protective notoriety, or (iii) They say something out of step with the ever changing whims of their own populist frenzy and get cancelled/cannibalized so the rest of them can maintain their performative loyalty."
5-3-5,Teflon Don
5-3-5-1,"Do people not know the original ""Teflon Don"" John Gotti was not able to escape prison. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1992.In the end continuing criminal activity after getting off almost always catches up to criminals. The saying is ""The wheels of justice turn slowly but grind exceedingly fine.""  exist for a reason.Only caveat is, are people willing to just say a President or Ex-President is above the law? That's what this will all come down to."
5-3-5-1-1,"The insane weirdness of this whole thing is that it was *Rudy Giuliani* who took down the original ""Teflon Don."""
5-4,"The same people who stole money from cancer charities would *never* commit fraud, I refuse to believe it."
5-4-1,"Moreover, kids' cancer charities"
5-4-1-1,Wow really? That's truly disgusting.
5-4-1-1-1,"As part of a resolution of the lawsuit announced on November 7th, Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, or $250,000, a piece to eight different charities. Those charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children’s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha’s Table, the United Negro College Fund, the United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Additionally, Trump was forced to reimburse his namesake foundation $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation’s bank account. The combined $1,809,123.30 was split evenly and recently transferred to the eight agreed upon charities. Each charity ended up receiving a total of $476,140.41."
5-4-1-1-2,"Well yeah, they're the living embodiment of all the worst aspects of America."
5-4-1-2,He’s like a fucking cartoon villain
5-5,And this is how he'll be forced to admit he's broke.
5-5-1,"""I had to say I was broke, it wasn't true"""
5-5-1-1,"""... and even if it was true, which it is not - let me be very clear - it is not, okay? But if it was, it would be the most beautiful, wonderful broke that anyone has ever seen. People would look at this broke, and actually, it's not even broke - it's just a complete lack of funds - and they would say, wow. Just, wow. To be broke like that is really, truly an honor - really. Truly. An honor."""

6-1,"Winston Churchill, who once remarked: “The United States can always be relied upon to do the right thing — having first exhausted all possible alternatives.”"
6-1-1,Lol that's that's pretty good burn.
6-1-1-1,"Winston Churchill's relationship with the U.S. and President Roosevelt is meant for TV. When Pearl Harbor happened, he took the entire office of Prime Minister, got on a boat, and sailed to D.C. unannounced.He showed up at the White House on Christmas Eve and got drunk off the President's best scotch with the White House staff for three weeks before finally leaving. Eleanor Roosevelt was pissed."
6-1-1-1-1,"If I could go back in time, I’d like to get shitfaced with Churchill.  The dude would probably drink me under the table, but I’d give it my all."
6-1-1-1-1-1,Thomas Shelby knows all too well
6-1-1-1-1-1-1,"No Fighting. No F\*\*\*Ing Fighting, No Fighting, NO F\*\*\*ING FIGHTING!"
6-2,Announcement that he's running for president incoming
6-2-1,It’s the only way he can save himself. He has to spin this as political persecution so he can rile up the idiots and get some more grifting done.
6-2-1-1,He saves himself by just existing.  There is no jury in America that doesn’t have one MAGA person who’ll refuse to convict
6-2-1-1-1,Isn't that why they do the selection process?
6-2-1-1-1-2,The worst jurors either lie about their bias or remain silent through the whole process so you have no valid reason to strike them if you’re out of no cause needed strikes.
6-2-1-2,He'll split the DeSantis vote in half if he runs. Probably actually saves Biden a second termE: primary
6-2-1-2-1,"Split the DeSantis vote? He isn't going to run 3rd party. Trump is going to be the GOP nominee unless this investigation results in a conviction. No other Republican, including DeSantis, is going to stand a chance in the primary against a former President with high approval ratings within the party.     I know that people don't want to hear that, but it's something we should all mentally prepare for."
6-2-1-2-1-2,"I actually think DeSantis will beat him because all Republican media will put their weight behind him and praise him as Trump but younger and more focused, but also send the signal to people who don't want Trump ""Hey look it's not Trump"". They'll turn on Trump, ever so slowly and subtly until they get the fascist they really want. They've already begun laying the groundwork for this.:edit: The amount of people who engage heavily into politics but don't know what a primary is is very concerning."
6-2-1-2-1-2-2,"I've also heard DeSantis was favored over Trump by Republicans because he actually knows the system and isn't a giant baby that throws tantrums to get his way.On the one hand I feel like he wouldn't do the outright BS things Trump did, on the other I am scared he will be more effective about damaging our rights."
6-2-1-2-1-3,"God, no one take this as an endorsement for Trump but wouldn’t DeSantis be worse? Trump is a bumbling idiot whose vision for America isn’t anything other than being worshipped. DeSantis, Hawley, etc. seem much more calculated towards a “bigger” vision."
6-2-2,He keeps saying at his rallies that he won the election in 2016 and 2020.   If he won twice doesn’t that make him ineligible to run for President again?
6-2-2-1,"He, also screamed that the 2016 election wasn't legitimate, even though he won, so.... He should have 3 terms. The mental gymnastics is exhausting."
6-2-2-2,"He wasn't sworn in, so he even he admits he never served a second term."
6-2-2-2-1,I love living in times where we constantly have to define what reality is.. like it absolutely could be feasible for the Maga crowd to believe he really did serve a 2nd term and it was covered up by the left.
6-2-3,"If he does, then campaign finances are now fair game too…uncle RICO just waiting and hoping"
6-2-3-1,He could throw a football clear over those mountains
6-2-4,"He thinks running for pres will save him from legal prosecution. As usual, he doesn't understand shit."
6-2-4-1,It probably will though
6-2-4-1-1,"Not really. Don't think that Trump won't be challenged either. DeSantis, Pence, and Liz Cheney appear to be gearing up to run, and every primary debate will inevitably bring up the fact that Trump is being investigated."
6-2-4-1-1-1,And Trump will say that he won't be convicted on fake charges. That's managed to hold him over in the past.
6-2-4-1-1-1-1,"And then he will deflect and say “Obama is under investigation too” And Faux News will run nightly pieces on Hunter Biden’s laptop and how Obama did a zoom call in it or whatever. Nightly from August until Election Day and all the republicans who vote will believe it and say “Obama and Trump or under investigation it’s just what happens to former presidents. It’s fine!” And they will vote trump. Then after the election when the Hunter Biden laptop with Obama zoom meeting stuck inside cannot be found, these same republicans will say, “look at Hillary’s emails again because those got lost too!”And faux won’t get in any trouble for lying to millions every night. Trump won’t get in trouble because he’s president. Obama won’t get in trouble either because faux made up the horseshit like they always do. And America will become a Christian only nation where the word “gay” is banned to spell or say and woman and minorities have no rights."
6-2-4-1-1-2,"Really? Because the Justice Department declared while he was sitting president that charges couldn't be brought against him.That had no basis in law though, they made it up on the spot, and they didn't not bring charges for any of the Ukraine or Russia stuff after he was no longer sitting either."
6-2-4-1-2,"Running doesn't, winning does for a while."
6-2-4-1-2-1,"For federal crimes, winning can save you permanently, since you can pardon yourself.President can't pardon state crimes, though."
6-2-4-1-2-1-1,"It is not clear if you CAN pardon yourself. Most legal scholars believe you can not. Nixon would have done it if he could, he had to have Ford pardon him instead to ensure that it held up to all legal scrutiny."
6-2-4-1-2-1-1-2,Ok but the conservative Supreme Court would probably side with him because the judicial system is heavily political as well. Every legal scholar in the country could say you can not but that doesn’t mean he can’t try.
6-2-4-1-2-1-1-4,As sad as it is Nixon isn't as corrupt as Trump and his Rep cronies
6-2-5,I don’t think he’ll officially announce. Just keep hinting/insinuating so he can raise money
6-2-5-1,"I think he will announce very soon. I think his only defense is witch hunt, politically motivated,the laptop,e-mails, Nancy, etc. it’s not like he would actually do anything to prove his innocence because as you know,  he can’t."
6-2-5-1-1,"Except in the mind of Trumpians Trump going “I didn’t do it” is definitive, documented, internationally scientifically supported, independently fact-checked, irrefutable proof he didn’t do it."
6-3,Criminal being investigated for crimes caught on camera.
6-3-1,"I’m a witness, saw it all live on the tv screen."
6-3-1-1,Weird how basically everyone in America and half the world is basically a witness
6-3-1-1-1,And yet half of America will insist aggressively that there was nothing to see…
6-3-1-1-1-2,"How bad could it be, we didn't even overthrow the government!!"
6-3-1-1-1-2-1,"What scares me is what they learned from the last one, for next time."
6-3-1-1-1-2-1-1,"If you look at past crimes which are almost entirely by Republicans, Nixon's crew went on to do crimes for Reagan.  Reagan's crew when on to do crimes for Bush, Bush's crew went on to do crimes for Trump.  There is a line of the same people showing up to do crimes over and over and none get prosecuted enough to teach them a lesson.  Nixon: Watergate: theft of opponent party data to try to win electionReagan: Iran/Contra,  Involving guns and terrorists and not in a good way.Bush Jr: Shipped people overseas to be tortured, said it wasn't but it was.Trump: Probably 50+ crimes.  Ukraine extortion, Georgia vote rigging, Russian collusion with Putin and Wikileaks, calling for Russia to hack the DNC (which they did), trying to overthrow the government, calling for the death of Mike Pence, using his position to funnel millions into his golf courses and hotels, ... I could go on, but why."
6-3-1-1-1-2-2,"Yeah, it didn’t even work anyway so it wasn’t *really* an insurrection, lol"
6-3-1-1-1-2-2-1,This is why no bank robber should be charged with robbery if it wasn't successful.Do I really need the/s?
6-3-1-4,"Same, and I hope I get to testify."
6-3-2,"DOJ: “We found Trump was responsible for inciting the Jan 6th attack”Cool. Wanna know when I found that out? On Jan 6th, when he incited the attack on live television, on a recorded broadcast.How much money do I need to get to the point where Walmart CCTV footage can catch me stealing a tv but the court needs to take 3 years to decide if I actually stole it or not?"
6-3-2-1,Does trump even have much money? He seems to have a history of lying about it so I’m not sure.
6-3-2-1-1,"Just another grift or two away. “Our fearless leader needs YOUR help TODAY!!

6-3-2-1-1-1-2,"As someone who works full-time in church, I support this message.Those people are embarrassing all of us, and I’m sorry y’all have to deal with it."
6-3-2-1-1-1-2-1,We need the leaders and other Christians to be more vocal in their rejection of Christian Nationalism and how the church has been used by politicians to create a divide in our country. I hope your church is one of those voices.
6-3-2-1-1-2,"The things some people won't see even if it's right in front of their eyes...""But he's a successful businessman"" they say"
6-3-2-1-1-2-1,"If you measure success by people duped vs. bankruptcies declared, yea, he’s not too bad"
6-3-2-1-3,He got a heap when he was president by using government money to fund his businesses.
6-3-2-1-3-1,"And don’t forget his phony university,  the money he stole from his charity, etc Trump and his family are prohibited from starting any other ‘charitable foundations’ so now he just asks for money for campaigning and uses it to pay his bills. He’s about as fucking crooked as can be imagined."
6-3-2-1-4,He has money. They send out multiple emails a day asking for donations. I used my junk email to reserve tickets for rallies and it gets emails daily from him. I like to screetshot them so I can share them. Some of them are so crazy
6-3-2-1-4-1,"I get those too. Have you noticed that the ""make this a recurring donation"" box comes **pre-checked?** You have to actively UN-check it if you don't want the donation to be sucked out of your bank account regularly. And that's IF you notice it, in that tiny font.It's so sleazy and scummy."
6-3-2-1-5,He let a Trillion dollars of PPP walk away.  I would guess he wanted a Billion in kickbacks.
6-3-2-2,Hell I’m not sure how his call where he asked a Georgia election official to find votes for him wasn’t a clear cut crime/corruption
6-3-2-2-1,The fact that he took boxes of classified documents with him to Mar-A-Lago when his term ended should be enough to arrest him. He had those papers for a year before agents recovered them. How much sensitive information found it's way into the hands of lord knows who?
6-3-4,And he’ll get no punishment
6-3-4-1,Maybe not jail or prison but I wouldn’t mind seeing him under a couple of years house arrest with an internet ban.
6-3-4-1-1,"I'll just be happy with 'can't run for president'. I got a text today asking for my 'support' for him running. The funny thing was the last question on the survey was will I donate $20, or will I donate more than $10' so clearly a scam. But I will feel so much better if he is just gone forever. Edited cause typing on phone is hard."
6-3-4-1-1-1,"You know what's really frustrating? During the impeachment stuff (I believe), they actually had the opportunity to invoke a part of the 25th Amendment which would've made it so that Trump could never run for public office again, but everyone let it slip by. Trump not even being able to run again was on the table and the opportunity was squandered."
6-3-4-1-1-1-1,Ugh. It is so frustrating. I just want him to go awY. I want these weirdos to stop having so much influence. I'm just so tired
6-3-4-1-1-2,His entire life has been one long scam.
6-3-4-1-2,"Then he’ll dig out his ages old fax machine and spam the world with that. Nobody will be able to read them since he’ll dial our cells, but we’ll all be tortured answering a bunch of *skrreeeeee**beepbeep**skreeeeeeee* calls"

6-4,Guys we South Koreans impeached one of our president and put her in jail for corruption. Just wanted to let you know...
6-4-1,The French will burn cities to the fucking ground over their taxes going up and here we are patting ourselves on the back because our Justice Department hinted that they might be taking the rule of law seriously regarding crimes we all watched unfold live on television.
6-4-1-1,"And when Americans bother to protest in anything more than the least offensive way possible, they get accused of ""burning cities to the ground."""
6-4-1-1-1,>And when Americans bother to protest in anything more than the least offensive way possible...triggering four months of unchecked police brutality across the entire nation which we seem to have collectively forgotten about.
6-4-1-1-2,"Accused? Well, the DHS announces the protestors' presence in advance, accuses them \*in advance\* of terrorist activity, and stations snipers on the roofs of surrounding buildings.Equal protection under the law."
6-4-1-1-3,That was the same garbage can fire that Faux played on loop. Somehow it became entire cities razed to the ground by BLM.
6-4-1-1-3-1,My aunt believed that DC had been burned to the ground.  She was shocked when I said that I was still going in on a regular basis.  I invited her son out to see some monuments because I believed the exposure to “other” would greatly benefit him.  She insisted on coming along for his safety (he’s a young adult).  She was completely shocked that everything was so normal and intact.
6-4-1-1-3-1-5,I protested in Denver. My aunt called me asking if I was in one of the burning buildings. There were no burning buildings. My eyes were on fire for sitting and drinking a bottle of water in front of a bank and getting maced out of a police vehicle window about a half mile from where the protests were. If I didn’t hate cops before I sure would now.
6-4-1-1-3-2,I can't believe there was a bigger out rage over destruction of buildings more than the killing of black people BY POLICE (of all people) because of their skin color.
6-4-1-1-3-2-1,Really? You can't? A lot of conservatives have seen that as one of the police's primary purposes for generations. It wasn't a shock to me at all.
6-4-1-2,"American protesters have to face local law-enforcement agencies that have received decades of military equipment runoff from the most robustly funded military in human history, not forgetting that the same local law enforcement agencies have been publicly getting away with murder about once a month despite sustained, widespread disapproval. Americans want change and they’re willing to get it just the same as everyone else; it’s just really fucking hard."
6-4-1-2-1,"And the ammosexuals in the U.S. are the same people that excuse and support the police to behave this way. If only the ""well regulated militia"" was focused on a tyrannical government and protecting our first amendment...."

6-5-1-2,"Oh my friend... NY has had so many cases against him in the 80s and 90s, but they were mostly civil. However all the shit he was doing was illegal then too.It was dumbfounding to us that half the country ate his shit in 2016. He used bankruptcy in the 90s the way people use toilet paper."
6-5-2,"Exactly. This is just like the impeachment. A whole lotta nothin.Once he’s in prison (and I don’t mean with a 6month time served sentence), then I’ll celebrate."
6-5-2-1,"The ONLY reason his impeachments didn’t have any sort of meaningful impact is because republicans controlled the senate. In the first impeachment, the republican controlled senate refused to listen to credible witnesses and review the evidence. Same shit happened with the second impeachment - refusing to acknowledge evidence.How the fuck can you win a case when the judge (Republican senators) refuses to review the evidence? You can’t win. There’s a reason Robert Mueller specifically said it would take a “traditional court” for Trump to actually face consequences for his actions. Which is what the DoJ is attempting to do - to get his ass to an actual court that isn’t flooded with stupid ignorant comments/questions by guys like Gym Jordan and Matt Gaetz."
6-5-2-1-1,Several senators said *before the impeachment trial started* that they weren’t going to vote for impeachment. It’s beyond ignoring evidence. They decided the outcome before the start.
6-5-2-1-3,"That’s well and good, but he’s still going to get a jury trial, and it’s going to be nigh impossible to get 12 non-trump-supporter jurors."
6-5-2-1-3-1,"He’s not going to court in bum-fuck, Mississippi. There are PLENTY of non-trump supporters in D.C. and if he goes to New York, he’s even more fucked. The evidence is completely stacked against his stupid ass."
6-5-3,Trump will probably get rich from this.He will ask his supporters for money to fight the “lies and injustice.”His supporters are going to up their cash donations.He will get away without any consequence.A few scape goats will fall but nothing else.MAGA culture is here to stay. It will be a few generations before that’s an embarrassment of the past.  Assuming the country survives that long.
6-5-3-1,"In a way I'm rooting for MAGA culture. It's showing signs of splitting the republican party, so if we want to actually end the two party system, then having a MAGA party probably is the only way it's going to happen in our life-time. I foresee a MAGA party splintering republicans, then the progressives on the left who are fed up with the do-nothing democrats split into a 4th party. All of a sudden being a libertarian candidate actually means you have a chance and we've got 5 parties and actual representation across the whole spectrum, which should (hopefully) lead to more moderate decisions based on more than the whole ""Our side won"" bullshit."
6-5-5,"He is wealthy and influential so he would go to rich white guy prison. His version of ""jail"" is just Mar-a-lago, but his name isn't on the sign and he's not allowed to leave. So it's 92% the same as his current life."
7,"Democrats maintain control of Senate, NBC News projects, defeating many Trump-backed Republicans"
7-1,Now we turn to Georgia and make Sinema and Manchin less relevant.
7-1-1,"Exactly. Don't get complacent--it's time to double down, especially since senators serve for six years. We need to plan ahead and turn every seat blue we can."
7-1-1-1,"I'll show up to vote against fascism every chance I get until I die. I'm in Indiana. It's not realistically turning blue in the near future, but it won't be because I didn't get up off my ass and vote."
7-1-1-1-2,"Indiana Dem Party is trash. I’m highly politically involved, and Dems here have done very little to organize and bring people into the fold. If we started treating every race as winnable, maybe we’d get somewhere."
7-1-2,More Cinema than Manchin
7-1-2-1,Yeah. Manchin is the best you can hope for in WV and you know what you're getting.  Sinemma just lied about who she was
7-1-2-1-1,Exactly. Manchin is Manchin. The alternative is much worse. Sinema can easily be primaried and replaced with a better candidate
7-1-2-1-1-2,Ruben Gallego is 100% primarying her.
7-1-4,Wouldn't be surprised if they flip parties to be honest
7-1-4-1,"Manchin won’t. He gets a lot of shit, but he never pretended to be anything other than what he is. Sinema, on the other hand, just might pull a stunt like that."
7-1-4-1-1,"Manchin would make a tenth of the money he makes as a Democrat as a Republican. There's 0% chance he switches parties unless the democrats make him, and they can't really afford to lose him. He generally comes around, he gets a soundbite in so the WV voters see him fighting against the democrats, and when it counts he's been there. I'm sure they bribe him, he's totally that kind of politics dude."
7-1-4-1-1-3,Yes! A lot of what Manchin and Sinema do is political theater. I don't think many realize it.
7-1-4-2,They won’t do that because they’ll lose in a Republican primary. Arizona and West Virginia Republicans won’t vote for them because they’ll prefer the “actual” republican candidates
7-2,Hopefully Georgians don’t stay home. Still CAN NOT let Herschel Walker become a senator
7-2-1,I’ll be embarrassed if Herschel Walker wins and I’m not even from Georgia.
7-2-1-1,"He did get less votes, but it should have been a blowout with Walker losing heavily.I think some people haven't heard this man talk. He legitimately isn't well"
7-2-1-1-1,"I read a great comment earlier today. The right votes R not because of who the person is and they bring to the table, they vote R because they know they will vote for what leadership tells them and it’s effectively a rubber stamp for the party line. It’s so fucking true. Tuberville is a perfect example of this."
7-2-1-1-1-1,"It’s not just that; Kemp was (sadly) decently popular, so Walker definitely rode on his coattails a bit"
7-2-1-1-1-1-1,"True but misleading; Kemp was not really popular, its just that people turned out specifically to vote against Abrams. Right wing media has spent the last two years making her into the boogeyman. She was a rising star in the democratic party and was easily portrayed as ""the reason the republicans lost the senate"" in 2020. That plus the ability to put her picture up on the screen and instantly have most of their base hate her either because she's blue or black made her into an easy national target. They wanted to cut her off at the knees after whispers started about a possible future presidential run."
7-2-1-1-1-2,I sincerely do not want 2% of the Senate to be there because football.
7-2-1-1-1-4,"I may get downvoted to oblivion…But with the current close battle in Congress, I vote Dem, not bc of the person, but because I want Democrats to pass legislation that I want passed. I shouldnt blame Republicans for doing the same."
7-2-1-1-1-4-5,Yeah I don't see many Democrats voting for someone who's pro-life just because the Democratic candidate is a moron.
7-2-2,Hopefully this will discourage Walker voters now that the Senate isn't up for grabs anymore. The only thing they have now is the thought that they spent time out of their day to vote for Herschel Walker.
7-2-2-1,"No Kemp (edit: on the ballot), no control of the senate even if Walker wins, at a minimum that's gotta be discouraging af."
7-2-2-1-1,"Wait didn't Kemp win though?Edit: oh I see what you mean, Kemp won't be on the runoff ballot (since he already won the governor's race) so there's less incentive for GA republicans to vote this time around"
7-3,Pack it up folks! We're now on down do Georgia to *expand* the majority.
7-3-2,If people ask me I’m gonna say it’s for 2 reasons. 1) to expand the majority so everything isn’t hung up on one person forever. 2) more importantly. A Senator serves for 6 years. Whoever wins the GA runoff will hold the seat until January 2029. You positive democrats will hold the presidency in 2024? How about the senate midterm in ‘26. The impacts of this are much larger than just the next 2 years. Clarence Thomas will be 80 by the time this Senator leaves their seat. Who do you want voting on Thomas’ replacement?
7-3-2-2,"If Trump runs again, he will lose. His popularity is even taking a beating from Republicans after the midterm failure on their part. They're *trying to drop him, but he will never let his cult go and will drag the party down with him."
7-3-2-2-1,"I'm honestly curious if they'll just start saying ""lock him up"" to get rid of him. Like let him face all the charges he should have faced ages ago."
7-3-2-2-1-1,"Will be interesting to see play out. That's for sure. All the non magas who want DeSantis are gonna start slinging MAD shade at trump if he tryst to hold their party hostage. He's no Romney or McCain. He's not just gonna...""move aside"" after losing."
7-3-4,"Hey, we need that extra seat for all sorts of reasons. There are a lot of old ass Senators; with a 50/50 split, one geriatric Senator dying could flip the chamber."
7-3-4-1,It also lets Democrats go around Manchin or Sinema holding up everything (but not both together unfortunately).
7-3-4-1-1,"I'm hoping this means that Sinema will fall in line a little more now, personally. She's up for reelection in 2024 if she decides to go for it, but the situation in Arizona is a *lot* different than it was in 2018.'No filibuster vote, no support next election and we'll take our chances with literally whoever comes at you from the left' seems like it would be a good way to keep her on track, but is also a strategy that couldn't work for Manchin due to his position in a super red state."
7-3-4-1-1-2,"I mean now that Kelly has won twice now her ""I'm in a red state wahhh"" excuse doesn't really cut it anymore"
7-3-4-2,"Manchin and sinema exist. They're combined like -1.5 dem votes fwiw, we need walker to lose"
7-3-5,"If the Rs are going to call us Satanists anyways, then the devil is going down to Georgia."
7-3-5-1,Ironic coz Warnock is a pastor and Gingrich called Football as the only man of god in the race.
7-4,“Red wave” is going to end up with Democrats having more senate seats than they started with.

7-4-1-1-1,“Wow! Democrats love to cheat!”“How are they cheating?”“They count all of the votes!”“Wha-?”
7-4-1-1-1-1,I saw the argument earlier that the red wave would've happened full force if absentee voting wasn't allowed. More convenient voting so as many people as possible have their voice heard = a bad thing?
7-4-1-1-2,*Sherman rises from the grave*
7-4-2,"This is nothing short of a total repudiation of Trumpism. If he runs in 2024, whether as the Republican candidate, or as a third-party candidate, it's going to be an unmitigated disaster for the Republican party.[And I'm there for it.]"
7-4-2-1,"I think it is a rejection of Trumpism, but also a reaction to the Supreme Court overturning Roe and threatening to overturn gay marriage, contraception, etc."
7-4-2-1-1,"Republicans in general. They're absolute shit ""leaders"" and more and more people are realizing it. Even their extreme gerrymandering's hardly working."
7-4-2-1-1-1,*Only* their extreme gerrymandering is working. Without it even the House wouldn’t be within their grasp.
7-4-2-1-1-1-1,Michigan voters passed a ballot proposal to reduce gerrymandering by creating an independent redistricting committee to draw voting maps.All branches of the state gov are now controlled by Dems.  First time in the legislature in 40 years. This is not a coincidence.
7-4-2-1-2,"Thank you, you get it. I was trying to get this across upthread. Roe was overturned in June, Trump has been a threat for seven years. A lot of this momentum is due to Roe."
7-4-2-1-2-1,"I very much agree that’s it’s all due to roe and the prospect of minority groups losing more even more rights under republican controlled courts. It’s sad that people aren’t giving this much more credence. Had republicans gone light on their abortion rhetoric, they probably would’ve wiped the floor with Dems."
7-4-2-1-2-1-2,"But are these two things completely unrelated? Roe was a pretty stark reminder of how democracy can protect us from unsavory, unpopular violations of civil liberties."
7-4-2-1-2-2,"That alone may have dragged Gen Z out of the disconected shell, Gen Z being of childbearing age had a strong intrest in that."
7-4-5,The likely loss of the House will hurt.No more Jan. 6 commission.
7-4-5-1,"But unlike the senate, the House Majority Leader doesn’t have the power to prevent legislation from reaching a vote, so Democrats will still be able pass bills if they can flip X Republican votes. The senate is way more important in the world where Republicans wouldn’t confirm a single judge if they had the majority."
7-4-5-1-1,True.But there is still some hurt.  Like with Jan. 6 committee.

7-5-1-1-1,I'm sure they'd stop women voting as well if they could.
7-5-1-1-1-1,I wouldn't be surprised if that's on their list. And some of the women in office as Republicans would probably still vote in favor of the measure.
7-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Ann Coulter came out and said it herself about 20 years ago - women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they're ""too emotional"" and tend to vote for liberals."
7-5-1-1-4,Their gerrymandering will probably win them the house.
7-5-1-1-4-1,Gerrymandering is a huge issue.  I'm in WI and we just re-elected a Democratic governor but barely held off the Republicans from getting a veto-proof 2/3rds majority in the legislature.Edit: s/of/off
7-5-1-1-4-1-1,Here in NC the Republicans missed out on a super majority by 1 house seat. Insanity.
7-5-1-1-4-2,NY Dems fucking up the redistricting will probably win the Republicans the House.

10-1-3,"I mean, how many appeals can you file before you exhaust them? It seems trump gets unlimited appeals."
10-1-3-1,My layman’s understanding.  Any real lawyers can correct me if and where I’m wrong.You get one appeal per “thing” per layer.  It’s just that there are a lot of “layers”.  There are also a lot of “things”.If Congress and New York both want these records you’ll be seeing an appeal per layer for  each of these two independent cases.  That leads to a lot of reporting about appeals over his financial records.

10-2-1,Why does he have to hand them over. why can't the IRS just do it?
10-2-1-1,"Because Trump sued to stop it.  So the IRS is waiting until the legal issue is resolved, is my understanding."
10-2-1-1-1,Wonder why he's allowed to do this.  Is there even a legal issue?
10-2-1-1-1-1,"The lawsuit started while he was President. So when Congress requested them, like they are legally allowed to do, Mnuchin (Secretary of the Treasury over the IRS) immediately ran to tell Trump, who filed a lawsuit to stop it. There is no ""legal issue"" but more a separation of powers issue. The law clearly states Congress has the right to get anyone's taxes for legitimate legislative purposes. Trump is arguing it's a witch hunt, and there's no legitimate legislative purposes being served through Congress getting his tax returns.As with most lawsuits rich people are in, the goal is delay and distract. He successfully delayed this over 3 years, and Congress only gets it now because he's conceding the case. If he won reeelction, you can bet he would continue the case and draw it out another year or two."

10-2-2-1-2,"I just try not to underestimate the ability for congressional democrats to shoot themselves in the foot, and democratic voters to stay home on election day.Both have a tendency to disappoint when it matters, but republicans never miss an election and have made themselves immune to scandal or even criticism.&nbsp;Vote, tell others to vote, and call bullshit on anybody encouraging otherwise.If the midterms don't go blue and you didn't vote, then you don't get to say a thing about it."
10-2-2-1-2-1,"> I just try not to underestimate the ability for congressional democrats to shoot themselves in the foot""hey guys we are doing really well right now. I think it is a good time to bring up gun control and see how that goes."" - every chance they get."
10-2-2-1-3,"Don't just have hope, go out and vote and convince everyone you know to vote blue as well.Republicans have gerrymandered the fuck out of the november election. It's one of the reasons why they're still favored to win the house. If people don't get out and vote we can't punish that, and they may well just steamroll their way into the house and attempt to put a stop to all of the investigations.Hope doesn't win wars, you need to get out and vote."
10-2-2-1-3-1,"Fun fact- a lot of the gerrymandering was done based on 2016 results. The districts were made to inch out Republican pre-pandemic, as 4 pink districts is better than 2 deep red ones. Now it is 2022. Those margins shrunk as the morons died off from an avoidable ailment. It is NOT as hopeless as it seems on a map. Your vote really does actually count now, more than it did in 2020. Don't let the squiggly lines tell you otherwise. You can make sure that they know we're not putting up with this."
10-3,"[Trump said this in May of 2016]:> In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!It's been 6 years and he still hasn't released his tax returns.  Is the audit over yet, Mr. Trump?  Fucking liar."
10-3-2,"Just like how “his lawyers” were in Hawaii and you wouldn’t believe what they are finding out about Obama’s birth certificate, and he’ll release that *real soon*…"
10-3-2-1,And his awesome health care plan to repeal Obamacare.
10-3-2-1-1,"I remain the most bitter about this.  Promised to appear as soon as he was elected, promised to appear in ""months"" several times while he was in office, and finally, to appear in ""weeks"" just before the end of his term.This should have enflamed the American people.  Nope."
10-3-2-1-1-1,We were one vote away from losing the ACA with nothing to replace it. No plan whatsoever.
10-3-2-1-1-1-1,"Republicans constantly claimed to have better ideas for healthcare since pretty much the day Obama started becoming a serious contender for being a presidential candidate, way back in like 2008. And at absolutely no time since then have they put forth a serious workable proposal for a replacement. When the people actually put them in full control of the federal government for two years at the beginning of Trump's term, they still couldn't be bothered to propose anything legitimate. They are not serious about legislating or governing. Most of the current Republicans in congress wouldn't have the first idea how to even start writing a serious bill for something like health care reform."
10-3-2-1-1-1-2,"Yes, the plan was no plan.Trump gave the game away by insisting they have a plan."
10-3-2-1-1-2,Were you honestly surprised that it turned out he was lying?
10-3-2-1-1-2-1,"No, but this is much bigger than Trump's dishonesty.  The entire Republican party that has been shouting ""repeal and replace"" since the day that Obamacare was passed, has zero plan with which to replace Obamacare.  The problem is not just Trump; the whole party is stupid and evil."
10-3-2-1-1-2-1-1,"Even while Obama was still in office, Obama routinely told them they're welcome to present their plans to change or improve healthcare, for years, and not one single Republican came forward with anything other than ""Well, we've just gotta scrap Obamacare entirely."""
10-3-2-1-1-4,"All the people who claimed he was some ""outsider"" trying to ""drain the swamp"" should have been pissed off as soon as they saw his cabinet choices. I never thought he'd be anything besides a mafia-wannabe grifter, but anyone who believed his lies should have known what's up when they saw who he thought the ""best people"" to hire were. He surrounded himself with shills, yes-men and outright pieces of shit."
10-3-2-1-1-4-1,A wise point. Totally forgot that was one of his selling points. Sigh. He sucks.
10-3-2-1-1-5,Who knew healthcare was so hard?
10-3-2-1-2,"What exactly did Trump even accomplish while in office. Aside from sending our country into chaos and committing crimes, he didn't do shit. What a waste of 4 years. I'm not a huge Biden fan but at least he is getting things done. Expect massive steps backwards again if a republican gets elected again though.Edit:  yeah lots of bad stuff, I was mostly talking about anything positive. The only positives were accidents."
10-3-2-1-2-1,"He gutted a lot of our infrastructure. The Post Office is just one example. He hollowed out a lot of federal institutions, gutted the EPA, etc. He has sowed endless skepticism about our democratic processes.  As a Russian asset, he couldn't have done a better job destabilizing our national institutions and people's faith in them. Disinformation. When you back up and really see who he's been working for (himself, Russia, and the highest bidder), it all really makes sense."
10-3-2-1-2-1-1,"It's hard to choose the worst damage, but the State Department apparently lost a *lot* of veteran diplomats, which are hard to replace."
10-3-2-1-2-1-1-1,It’ll take decades to replace the amount of institutional knowledge lost from the State Dept because career civil servants bailed when they saw how bad things would be.
10-3-2-1-2-2,Neil Gorsuch  Brett Kavanaugh  Amy Coney Barrett
10-3-2-1-2-3,Massive tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations
10-3-2-1-2-3-1,Biggest heist ever of public money threw PPP loans.
10-3-2-1-2-3-1-1,And paying himself to stay at his golf resort with the secret service and other staffers several times a month after repeatedly saying he wouldn't have time to golf if he were elected (unlike Obama who went once in 8 years iirc)
10-3-2-1-2-4,Put a TON of conservative MAGA judges across the nation in top judicial spots who are still there.
10-3-3,I suppose that is an excellent justification for hiring more irs agents. 6 years for a single tax return? Send those guys some help. Or just keep lying whatever you think is best.
10-3-3-2,Not to mention the IRS pretty much never audits rich people.  So I guess the argument could be made that he's either lying or not that rich.  My guess would be both.
10-3-3-2-1,"Also, the IRS has said, repeatedly, that Trump is perfectly fine to release his taxes while under audit.  And they were bewildered why that could be considered an excuse."
10-3-3-2-1-1,IIRC Nixon released his returns while under Audit.You know it's bad when NIXON is more transparent than you are.
10-3-3-2-1-1-1,"Nixon was infinitely more respectable, intelligent, and honorable than Trump, and Nixon was a ratfucker of the highest degree."
10-3-3-2-1-1-1-1,"I think what Nixon was was someone who didn’t understand the sheer depths of open corruption American conservatives would accept and American liberals wouldn’t riot over. I don’t think anyone in politics knew just how much blatant bullshit the American voters would swallow, and it took someone like Trump to really push this to the far edge. That, or decades of Fox News and conservative talk radio radicalized the right and desensitized the left enough to change us into a voting population who will put up with just about anything and ask for seconds.In either case, I won’t say that Nixon was a better man than Trump. Just one who thought he had to operate under at least *some* rules or be bounc d out of politics. But then on the other hand, Nixon at least liked dogs."
10-3-3-2-1-1-1-2,Nixon used to get black out drunk and try to nuke countries… and that is amazingly still better than anything Trump does
10-3-3-2-2,"That’s his entire con, dude has never really been that rich. He’s always been losing money left and right and has declared bankruptcy multiple times, his brand is basically faux wealth."
10-3-4,Has trump ever told the truth?
10-3-4-1,"""I will accept the results of the election *IF I WIN*!""That statement seems to have come true.But then, he disputed the election in 2016 because he lost the popular vote, so there's that."
10-3-4-1-1,"When he said he could shoot someone and not lose supporters, that wasn't a lie"
10-3-4-2,[I LOVE the poorly educated!]
10-3-4-2-1,True as long as you understand he meant:I love (manipulating and grifting) the poorly educated.

10-3-5,"Imagine the surprise Putin will get when he goes through the copied secret files, and suddenly finds Trump’s financial records in between? Trump’s team have had so many fuck ups, I wouldn’t be surprised they sent Putin the wrong stack of papers."
10-3-5-2,I bet you Trump has a picture of Putin flexing his muscles in the box of documents that he sent Putin.  Putin has never had a more supplicating subordinate than Trump.
10-4,Better start sending out those donations to MAGA world for the legal fees
10-4-1,"Its already happening, I recommend signing up for their email lists, the amount of shit they they send you selling merch and asking for money is hilarious for so called 'billionaires'."
10-4-1-1,My personal favorite: Would you donate $10 to help President Trump? A. YesB. I’d like to donate more!That’s it. Those were the only 2 options.
10-4-1-1-1,"They believe their followers are so dumb, and they are probably right."
10-4-1-1-1-1,"I had a coworker who checked his phone in front of me and said aloud, “trump hounding me for money again - can’t he wait till payday?”So this man sends money every email it appeared."

10-4-1-1-1-2-1,"I remember occasionally seeing people with the Obama HOPE shirts and every once in awhile a hat during and immediately after the 2008 election - but outside that, has anybody ever dressed themselves completely in schlocky political schwag the way these people do? Even years after the campaign? Years after his presidency at this point."
10-4-1-1-1-3,I've seen a lot of them where people are signing up for recurring donations.
10-4-1-1-1-4,"Over $20M was donated to Trump's last ""legal defense fund"" Of course it didn't go to a damn legal team. It went into the pockets of him and his cronies."
10-4-1-1-2,"Makes me think of the bullshit ""polls"" issued to soothe Trump's ego, where it was like ""Do you approve of the job Trump is doing?""A) ""Yes, he is the bestest president in the history of anything!""B) "" No, because I'm a godless hyper-Commie who kicks puppies and wants to see our Glorious Christian society burn to ashes around me"""
10-4-1-2,"Nothing is funnier than the Trump bear, who the fuck wants that haha"
10-4-1-2-1,Are they grooming kids now? Why else would you buy political merch for someone under the legal voting age?Just asking questions.
10-4-1-2-1-1,"Check it out, literally thought it was an SNL skit"
10-4-1-2-1-1-4,"I…I…can’t watch it again, but was one of those endorsements from a guy named ‘Warholic’? SNL isn’t this good"
10-4-1-2-1-1-4-1,I always compared his presidency to “VEEP” but even they couldn’t write this insane amount of screwups and corruption that we witnessed
10-4-1-2-1-2,Yeah it’s all about grooming. Hook ‘em while they’re young. I’m seeing it in my extended family. My niece recently attended a GOP event with her parents and you would have thought she attended a rock concert the way she was acting…. Not normal 12 year old behavior.
10-4-1-2-1-2-1,I saw a girl in Meijer a couple of weeks ago who couldn't have been older than 14 wearing a MAGA hat.  Last weekend saw a kid maybe 6-8 years old wearing a pro-life t-shirt.
10-4-2,"Hi gamerdudeNYC,   This is Don Jr. Trump and my dad found out you haven’t donated recently and he was very  surprised since he always says gamerdudeNYC is his biggest fan and always donates! He is very bigly sad please donate so we can fight these evil democRAT deep state RINOs!"
10-4-2-1,This would be laughable if I hadn't gotten spam texts from them somehow with almost this exact wording.
10-4-2-1-1,Pretty sure this was copy/pasted from the last few they sent out.

11,Supreme Court allows release of Trump's tax records to House Democrats
11-1,Read 'em quick and hold multiple public hearings.
11-1-1,"You don't need to actually read them, Mike Gravel engineered a situation where he held a meeting as the sole member of the subcommittee he chaired, and unanimously (because he was the only member) entered 4k+ pages of the pentagon papers into the public record."
11-1-1-1,He was a fucking baller. Sad loss.
11-1-1-1-1,"With a name like Mike Gravel, how can you not be a badass?Or maybe a paver.But a badass one."
11-1-1-1-1-1,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it’s pronounced Gruh-vehl. Or good news. It’s a badass name either way."
11-1-1-1-1-1-2,“You will grovel over these gravel prices!” And then he winks as the camera pans out over a huge gravel pile behind a warehouse.
11-1-1-1-2,"Sounds like a legend, is there a documentary on him?Tony Benn is a legendary British MP."
11-1-1-1-5,He will go to jail.
11-1-1-1-5-1,"He's dead though, so...?"
11-1-1-1-5-2,"Even if he wasn't dead, Congress has immunity for anything they say while performing their duties (Art. 1, Sec. 6), so he couldn't be prosecuted, nor could anyone who reads this into the record. At worst they could be expelled, although being censured would be more likely."
11-1-1-1-5-3,Seems unlikely.
11-1-1-2,"I have to admit, until that sentence ended with an outcome favoring openness and accountability, that sounds like a bullshit situation we should probably not allow to happen. Not even like 'what if Republicans do it back' because they can ruin absolutely anything with bad faith and outright fraud. Let's stick a pin in that and fix it, if and when our democracy isn't hanging by a thread."
11-1-1-2-1,"We ran out of pins to stick in things and with all the supply chain issues, it's probably going to be awhile before we get more pins.Before you suggest using a pin that was removed from another issue we pinned and layer cleared I'll point out, we always pin, never clear so that won't work."
11-1-1-2-3,It definitely sounded like a situation ripe for abuse.I shudder to think that it has already happened before and has the possibility to happen again
11-1-1-2-3-1,But it is nice to see it abused for good for once.
11-1-1-2-4,"He gamed the rules, but did it for an excellent cause."
11-1-1-2-4-1,There are no un-gameable rules so best get used to playing
11-1-1-3,"This is a big part of winning the Senate race in Georgia. With just a 50/50 tie in the Senate, all the committees are also split. If Dems get a 51st Senator, they get control of the committees."
11-1-1-3-1,Dems do control the committees. They get the chairs and GOP gets ranking member. The vice president breaks ties.
11-1-1-3-1-1,"VP only breaks ties on the floor, not in committee. 51 Senators will give Democrats outright majorities in committee, which will in turn give them subpoena power and a lot more room to work. In a 50/50 split the Republicans can block a lot of what the Senate wants to do. I can't emphasize this enough: 51 seats is an enormous, enormous advantage. The VP does break ties on the floor, but a lot of the Senate's work is done in committee, and 51 seats will make committees much more able to actually do things. It's a huge deal."
11-1-1-3-1-1-1,This is why it's hard to have political discussions here. Most have no idea how the system of politics actually works. Committee's are the power. When AOC and her crew threatened to give Pelosi a headache with her last speaker vote they were bribed with certain committee seats. The power of controlling committees is fucking big deal. Good call.
11-1-2,"Each year is several hundred pages long. It’s going to take a lot of time to fully review and compare the documents with other financial disclosures elsewhere they have in their possession. Best case is probably hand them over to the DOJ and recommend an investigation for possible crimes. Also, turn them over to NY AG to aid their ongoing investigation."

11-1-2-4,"Can't wait for the NY AG to get them. Ivanka is already having tantrums because their assets have all been frozen (to keep them from moving their ill gotten money into offshore accounts).

11-2-1,"Exactly, just release them en masse.  Let's go already this is ridiculous."
11-2-1-1,How unfair that they uncovered something presidents should always be transparent about in the first place
11-2-1-1-1,"Can't wait to hear how dirty it is that they're going to release this information he ""promised"" to make public six years ago"
11-2-1-1-1-1,"He literally gave a speech this past weekend where he claimed he had given more than any President to any investigation and included as he rattled off what he'd given investigators, he included ""His taxes"".That man lies as easily as breathing."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1,"It's habitual, compulsive. He can't *not* lie. Fabricating his own reality is his entire essence, it's who he is, deep down- a little child who habitually makes shit up, and never gets told no by mommy and daddy, never faces the consequences, just skates by doing whatever he wants and lying to literally everyone's face.The whole Trump episode has me jaded about the state of our nation. Though really he's just a product of right wing politics over the last, really, over 50 years. Part of the disease goes all the way back to the founding of the nation, even back to the earliest days of the pilgrims and colonists. It just keeps festering and boiling up under the skin. Lol I digress. Trump is but a lump in the cancer that is conservativism."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,">Trump is but a lump in the cancer that is conservativism.They're all trying to distance themselves now.Republicans created this mess by pandering to single-issue voters, and single issue voters are nearly all radical or even extremists.You reap what you sow, Republicans.

Because you took us down this path.>Historians have a word for Germans who joined the Nazi party, not because they hated Jews, but out of a hope for restored patriotism, or a sense of economic anxiety, or a hope to preserve their religious values, or dislike of their opponents, or raw political opportunism, or convenience, or ignorance, or greed.>That word is ""Nazi.""

11-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,This is also ther person who skipped a number in the floors so he had the tallest building. Which conveniently had a fire on the skipped number causing confusion for the fire department.
11-2-1-1-1-1-1-3,"To really understand how Trump became who he is, read Mary Trump's book. Seriously fascinating."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1-4,"I earnestly do not believe that Trump *intends* to lie. If he were lying intentionally, he would be more consistent with it.Instead, he just doesn't care if anything he says is actually the truth. The next sentence or of his mouth may any relationship with the truth on the spectrum, and in fact it may even directly contradict the statement immediately preceding it. He just doesn't care.He says whatever he believes people will respond best to, without any regard for if it is completely false, incidentally true, substantially true, or even classified information.Of course this means that most of what he says is in fact untrue, but the best way to understand that is to think not of it as lying, but as utterly divorced from fact."
11-2-1-1-1-1-1-5,The funny thing is that Trump is really not even a conservative at all. He's a populist grifter who will say whatever he thinks the people he's targeting want to hear.  He saw a big opportunity and took advantage of it which is one of the few things he's actually any good at.
11-2-1-1-1-1-2,How do you know Trump is lying? He's breathing
11-2-1-1-1-1-2-1,"My first thought was: he lied with every word.That hoary cripple with malicious eyeAskance to watch the workings of his lie on mine. And mouth scarce able to suppress the glee,That pursed and scored its edge, At one more victim gained thereby."
11-2-1-1-1-1-3,"Trump looks like he would have trouble breathing, so for him lying is much easier; open mouth, BS pours out."
11-2-1-1-1-1-4,Not pro trump at all but didn’t he have to hand over tax info to NY state? Might be the only half truth he’s ever told
11-2-1-1-1-2,"I wonder if he is going to call his tax return lies. That's not mine, democrats and the deep state planted it. I'm much much much much richer than it shows."
11-2-1-1-1-2-1,It's going to show criminal activity. I am certain they get him like they did capone
11-2-1-1-1-2-2,"What he'll say is that his taxes are very complicated, much too complicated for his worshipers to understand. He'll say it doesn't show the whole picture, but not release anything that would actually paint a more whole picture. Those who dislike Trump will say ""see the evidence of his crimes."" His worshipers will scream that it proves his innocence and was nothing but a witch hunt."
11-2-1-1-1-2-3,That’s literally exactly what he will do. Will say anything damning is lies and a witch hunt.
11-2-1-1-1-2-5,"Funny thing is if they do what they say, and bring to light all sorts of illegalities (which I’m sure there are many), that’s exactly what he’ll do. A) because it’s all he ever does. Just repeat/tweak/double down on his current bs. And b) quite honestly, it’s worked out ok for him. He’s a free man, and his supporters have by and large stayed in their positions. Considering how full of $hit he is and how open their basically fascist intentions are, the fact that they’re all still standing says a lot about the democrats. And it’s quite ominous."
11-2-1-1-1-3,HES JUST WAITING FOR THE AUDIT TO FINISH!!!!1!1!!1!/s
11-2-1-1-2,"And he has said he would release them as soon as he was legally able to. We all knew it was bullshit, but him fighting it made the bullshit stinky"

11-2-1-1-5,Not every president specially the conman
11-2-1-3,Just leak them. The SC leak has shown us they don't really care about leaks in government.
11-2-1-3-1,"Also, having been a president, such information SHOULD be public."
11-2-1-3-1-1,Oh shit! Which President are you?
11-2-2,Might find out there was some truth to this after all 
11-2-2-1,Of course there is. Records will show:1. He is nowhere near as rich as he claims2. He is a tax dodger3. His so called business empire is just Russian money laundering (with some Saudi probably also thrown in)Would explain his behaviour towards those countries
11-2-2-1-1,"And would also raise the question of, is someone so financially beholden to foreign adversaries fit to hold the office of the presidency?Given the number of times Trump made choices which were counter to America's interest, it's a legitimate question to ask."
11-2-2-1-1-1,"This. I work for the FAA and one of the many things they had to look at before granting me clearance was my finances.  I didn’t understand why at first, but I was told that it was essentially to see if there would be any risk of me selling secret information to pay off my debt.If some nobody like me needed to be looked at for a relatively trivial government job, it stands to reason that somebody with financial ties like Trump should be disqualified from holding an office that gives him broad authority to declassify whatever the hell he wants."
11-2-2-1-1-1-2,Does the FAA have lots of secrets?
11-2-2-1-2,Launder the Soviet money but depend on the Saudi money for the day to day expenses. Makes sense...
11-2-2-1-2-1,"In Soviet Russia, money launders you!"

11-2-2-1-2-3-2-1,"i dunno,   i've heard all sorts of things about russia, but ukraine is out of bounds now because they are now ""loved"""
11-2-2-1-4,"> He is a tax dodgerProbably, although the more likely scenario is he dodges taxes via loopholes that only the rich can afford to use. Rules implemented that we let slide."
11-2-2-2,That kind of information would not be on a personal tax return.
11-2-2-2-1,"If any of it is, he's an idiot. My guess is his presumed wealth vs his actual wealth is the reason behind him hiding it. Foreign ties are likely difficult to conclude from personal tax forms. But they may open threads to follow."
11-2-4,Perfect timing would have been immediately. This is scheduled to allow Republicans controlling the House to drop the records into a shredder along with any ongoing congressional inquiry into Trump and lackey corruption.
11-2-4-1,"I don't know, I think this is timed so that the Dems can release it and do the dirty work for the Republicans right before the Republicans take over.SCOTUS could have easily delayed another month or two and made this not happen. I think this is entirely a political move, they waited to see how the elections went, Republicans want to drop Trump, SCOTUS is making that happen without implicating Republicans."
11-2-4-2,Either that and/or the moment when they throw Trump himself into the proverbial wood chipper and fully embrace DeSantis.
11-2-4-2-1,"They're not going to damage the party that way. Trump will have to face other cases in court, but the US house of Representatives is going to shitcan every committee investigation into Trump and his allies. Then they'll benghazi/hillarymail every dumb evidence-exempt conspiracy theory they can invent for the next two years."
11-2-4-2-1-1,"Yeah I’m with you on that. I fully expect investigations into laptops, a debt ceiling shutdown, and top Dem impeachments at minimum. Could get a whole lot uglier but it looks like we’re still several years away from Republicans lining dissenters up on the wall."
11-3,"Now that we’re beyond the midterms and Republicans want him to go away, this happens.What a surprise."
11-3-1,Pull an Uno Reverse Card and have the dems refuse to release them until after the next election on the pretense that they don’t want to run a political attack on a candidate.
11-3-1-1,Release them a week before the 2024 election when trump is the nominee
11-3-1-1-1,"The idea is nice, but he needs to go. As soon as possible. This is not a partisan issue. He is actually anti democracy. I would rather see a republican who supports democracy in power than a democrat and looming fascism on the horizon."
11-3-1-1-1-2,"While I agree, if it's between trump and DeSantis, trump is less of a threat. I'm hesitant to want to take action against trump while he can still be useful in destroying the republican party. If he's offered as a sacrificial lamb, the real enemies of democracy can weasel their way out of this when they stay in power."
11-3-1-1-1-2-1,"Either way, he needs to pay for his crimes to reassure democracy to the American people."
11-3-1-1-1-2-2,You’re speaking 2016 speak.
11-3-1-1-1-4,> I would rather see a republican who supports democracyThere's your problem
11-3-1-1-1-5,Uhh well the other guy is DeSantis who is just as bad and evil as Trump while also being smarter.
11-4,Wouldn't it be funny if the only thing on Hunter Biden's laptop was a copy of Trump's tax returns.
11-4-1,That would 100% be proof God is playing a sick cruel joke on us
11-4-1-1,Rokos basilisk indeed
11-4-1-1-1,"I dont understand this reference, am I too young?"
11-5,"Lol, now that everyone turned on Trump, they suddenly have no problem releasing them. The US Supreme Court blatantly doing the bidding of the GOP, as always."
11-5-1," Do conservative justices think anything will happen?  Or do they know that a Republican majority house will do nothing with it?  Even if Dems take over in two years again, there is probably some clause that they'd have to start over at square one.When conservative justices know nothing will come off their decision, they usually make the right one so that they can claim to be moderate (when they are anything but)."
11-5-1-1,"I think its because the establishment GOP sees trump as no longer useful, so torpedoing his campaign now sets the stage for desantis to just walk through the primaries to the nomination. They don't care if the GOP led house does anything so long as the court of public opinion fully turns on trump too."
11-5-1-1-1,"They'll also get to weaponize his persecution while also claiming the supreme court is clearly unbiased.  It's unfortunately a perfect play for the GOP, hopefully this shit backfires on them somehow."
11-5-1-1-1-1,It only backfires if Trump runs as a 3rd party candidate
11-5-1-1-1-1-1,"Which he probably would, not because he thinks he can win that way, but just to punish the republicans for being ""disloyal"".  Even 10% of the vote he got in 2016 and 2020 would take every swing state off the table for the Republicans."
11-5-1-1-1-1-1-2,Don't forget about collecting that campaign money!  He can't keep running his grift unless he's running for office
11-5-1-1-1-1-2,What do you suppose would be the animal mascot of Trump's 3rd party?
11-5-1-1-1-1-2-2,A lion.  His rubes already use the imagery.
11-5-1-1-1-2,"Sure it was a 9-0 decision, but you know it was those damn liberal judges that did this!!"
11-5-1-1-2,Losing the primaries probably won’t stop trump from running. At least I hope it doesn’t.
11-5-5,Court does thing it was expected to do based on law.  Must be partisan politics.
12,Trump Organization convicted in N.Y. criminal tax fraud trial
12-1,">	The real estate, hospitality and golf resort operation headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Ave. faces the possibility of a **$1.6 million fine.**What a joke."
12-1-1,It's the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. I was hoping I misread that and it was supposed to $1.6 BILLION. &#x200B;Nope. Like a normal working jerk paying a $5 fine.
12-1-1-1,Right but if we committed tax fraud we’d go to prison.
12-1-1-1-1,"Avenatti just got 14 years in prison for defrauding his clients, but Trump and his goons get no jail time and no real monetary consequences..As Americans, I don't know what there is to be proud of. This country is so shameful when justice is constantly under assault."
12-1-1-1-1-1,Justice in this country is doing exactly as designed. Protecting the rich.
12-1-1-1-1-1-1,"The band Styx years ago, had the right idea in the song “Half Penny, Two Penny”“Justice for moneyHow much more can I pay?We all knowIt’s the American way”"
12-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,"I wish more songs these days would get political with their message like the old protest songs>*It ain't me, it ain't me*>*I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no*"
12-1-1-1-1-2,I said it back in 2016 even before all this happened.  He's always been involved in questionable legal issues way beyond simple tax fraud.  The presidency was his get out of jail free card. He played right-wingers to get himself elected (in the beginning his views were all over the place) cause he knew all of the things he did were going to catch up to him. Now he will never have to face the true consequences.  He pretended to bow down to the unhinged masses and now these angry violent loonies will throw their lives at his feet.
12-1-1-1-1-2-1,"Remember when the Republican primaries happened? And Trump won every county in the state of new york… except for one? Well that one was Manhattan county, and the fact that he lost his own home county should have raised enough red flags to prevent him ever being elected president. Obviously even nyc republicans knew he was full of shit. And yet he still was elected…."
12-1-1-1-1-2-1-1,He lost the popular vote both times he ran and still somehow got placed into office. What more can we do than vote? It's despicable feeling so helpless.
12-1-1-1-1-3,People need to start doing more against their oppressors in America.
12-1-1-1-1-3-2,We are too busy living in our cars bc rent is too high.
12-1-1-1-1-3-3,You got any brilliant ideas you want to share? Saying something like this is incredibly privileged: all criticism with no suggestions of how to change. It's not easy here.
12-1-1-1-1-3-3-1,Buddy I live paycheck to paycheck too. I had to eat stale bread and a can of processed low quality baked beans for dinner without any other meals today. But sure im privileged. Redirect your anger somewhere productive. I am not the enemy.
12-1-1-1-1-5,"Trump has really mastered the art of the fall guy.I wonder if he hires a lawyer to find a ""fall"" lawyer?"
12-1-1-1-2,"Unfortunately, we can't send a company prison."
12-1-1-1-2-1,"So corporations are people when it comes to campaign donations and closely held religious beliefs, but don't count when it comes to taxes or criminal acts done by the corporation's trustees and officers Yay America!"
12-1-1-1-2-1-2,Publicly traded corporations are slavery because youre buying a person
12-1-1-1-2-2,You can send those in charge to prison
12-1-1-1-2-2-1,I thought that was what all the post Enron financial reforms were to do— hold executives and boards liable for their crimes. Guess not.
12-1-1-1-2-2-3,"Right,The company didn't commit tax fraud. A person or persons did.If I did the same on my property taxes, I can't claim my house committed the tax fraud. It was the person who owned the property or the person who managed it."
12-1-1-1-2-2-4,"And, we do have the concept of a ""Corporate Death Penalty"". It would be interesting to see some corporations drawn and quartered."
12-1-1-1-2-2-4-1,Or nationalized
12-1-1-1-2-3,"Why not? They're people, apparently."
12-1-1-1-2-3-1,If SCOTUS really wants to play pretend that corporations are people then the corporate death penalty should be in play
12-1-1-1-2-3-1-3,Death by firing squad! Or is that only reserved for elementary schools in the ol' U.S. of A?
12-1-1-1-2-3-3,"All the benefits of personhood, none of the drawbacks"
12-1-1-1-2-3-3-1,Something something those the law protects and does not bind something something those the law binds but does not protect
12-1-1-1-2-3-4,"Strange how ""person-hood"" apply to important things like ""free of speech and religion"" but not ""criminal liability and destroying lives"" for corporates "
12-1-1-1-3,">Right but if we committed tax fraud we’d go to prison.I know we all hate the rich here but this basically never happens unless you commit some serious tax fraud and are probably rich to begin with. Us proles don't get prison time since it kinda prevents people from paying back the money and it ends up costing the state more than what a person actually owes. You WILL get fined out the ass though, that definitely happens."
12-1-1-1-3-3,"> this basically never happens unless you commit some serious tax fraud Yes, that's literally what they're mad about. These companies skirt taxes, benefits, do anything they can to screw over real people, and any fines they eventually, maybe see are pretty much nothing, just the cost of doing business."
12-1-1-1-3-3-1,">Yes, that's literally what they're mad about.No? The comment seemed to imply that a ""regular"" person like you or me would go to prison for tax fraud. That doesn't really happen. When it does happen, it's for good reason."
12-1-1-4,I'd argue 5 dollars means more to a working man than 1.6 mil means to a tyrant.
12-1-1-4-1,And you'd be right.
12-1-2,"Trump, three of his adult children, and the Trump Organization also still face a pending civil lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James that alleges widespread fraud involving years of false financial statements related to the company. James is seeking at least $250 million in damages in that case."
12-1-2-2,"If Trump ordered a crime that was carried out on his behalf, why isn't he going to prison?"
12-1-2-2-2,"Bc he's a rich, white man."
12-1-2-2-2-1,"There's at least 20 missing steps/causes between that and the outcome.  Like, who are the politicians in NYC and NY who we have to vote out of office?  Which organizations need to be investigated for corruption?"
12-1-2-2-3,I've kind of lost count of the number of people who've gone to jail for doing things on his behalf. You'd think that it would make more sense to treat the disease rather than the symptoms.
12-1-3,The Cult will be happy to pay that bill.
12-1-3-2,Cult is getting annoyed.
12-1-3-2-1,George is getting upset!
12-1-3-4,They literally will. Social media will be full of idiots bragging about how much of it they each paid.
12-1-4,He could just chip the gold off his toilet that he didn't pay the contractor for.
12-1-5,"lmao, ny attorney wasted how much on this investigation?  They gave one of the dudes immunity, and the other a deal of 5 months in jail to testify against the trump org (instead of the 15 years he would have received), all in order to get a 1.6 million fine? Ny is spineless."
12-1-5-1,"I believe there is a ongoing civil fraud suit against the Trump family and entities. It was interesting that in the closing arguments for this case the prosecution said ""clear evidence Trump ordered the fraud"" even though trump wasn't a defendant in this case. From that some speculate that this case was set up for that suit."
12-1-5-1-2,Why not hold him criminally responsible and give him 15 years or more of jail time?
12-1-5-1-2-2,Because this a civil suit. Criminal charges may be coming from a few ongoing criminal investigations.
12-1-5-1-2-2-1,"This is a criminal case, not a civil suit. Even if you didn't read the article, it explicitly says that in the title."
12-1-5-1-2-3,"Because there would be riots if they put an ex president in prison. I agree, that shouldn't be reason to not do it, but it surely factored into their decision."
12-1-5-1-2-3-1,"So put him in prison, and then put the rioters in prison."
12-1-5-1-2-3-1-1,"Agreed, but theyre not going to do that, because if you're a judge you're probably pretty conservative yourself."
12-1-5-1-2-3-2,There should be riots for *not* punishing outright treason.
12-1-5-1-2-3-4,Sounds like terrorism to me
12-1-5-1-2-3-4-1,"What, the riots? Yeah I'd agree with that. We don't seem to prosecute domestic terrorists very often though."
12-1-5-1-2-3-5,They would never put a former president in a prison anyways.  They are security liabilities for the rest of their lives and they would be an easy target in prison.
12-1-5-1-2-3-5-1,Just put him in isolation with his own room. His own everything. Problem solved.
12-1-5-1-2-3-5-2,"Exactly. It'd be way more trouble that it's worth to actually lock him up. Much better to just keep him destitute and keep an eye on him. He knows a lot of state secrets, you can't lock him up with other people, and you can't just keep him in solitary his whole life either.If Trump goes to prison (he should but he won't), then day one you have widespread domestic terrorist activities nationwide, day 2 he starts telling state secrets to whoever he's locked up with, day 3 his inmates start getting visits from terrorist groups and foreign nationals and day 4 state secrets are all over the news.The only way he'd go to prison is how Epstein went. He's too much of a liability to be alive in prison, in all sorts of ways."
12-2,Just 1.62 million punishment. What a paltry sum.
12-2-1,Cost of doing ~~business~~ *fraud*
12-2-1-1,The only thing goodnfrom this is that the organization will have a felony status.Which means reputable firms and banks won't do business with them.But at the same time I don't know if any reputable firms or banks did do business with them
12-2-1-1-1,"""We have all the financing we need from Russia."" -Don Jr.Yes, he actually said that."
12-2-1-1-1-1,Of fucking course he did. So they were getting money from Russia *and* Saudi. Truly a literal organized crime family.
12-2-1-1-2,Probably not considering he tends not to pay people. Can't imagine his businesses are much better about it
12-2-1-1-3,"They mostly didn’t.  In business school we studied a big company who decided to pay every invoice very late and only at 98% of the amount due.  “Sue us” was the response.  They thought they had figured out a great scam, but some of their suppliers stopped selling to them and the rest just raided the price to cover the shenanigans.  Soon they were paying a lot more than their competitors.I figure that’s what happened to Trump, the suppliers he stuffed either refused to work with him again, or they raised prices and demanded payment up front.  People are mostly honest in business because it’s in their interest to be honest."
12-2-2,"Being labeled as a criminal organization is going to make it much much harder for him to get loans and money. Yeah, the 1.6mill is a small sum, but the implications economically for him has gotten a lot worse. We haven't even gotten to the NY attorney general's suit yet. This is just the beginning of the end. Banks will never deal with him if he needs money. And he is going to need tons of money to keep his businesses running. He apparently has relied on this source for the last decade.Trump losing a lifeline by banks and loans will hit him harder in his narcissistic mind than his presidential run.His legal bills are going to mount much much more on appeal of this ruling."
12-2-2-1,He already burned financial bridges with American banks long before this conviction. Question is if it will have any impact on the Org's ability to continue securing loans through foreign sources.
12-2-2-1-1,"Seeing as how his properties are basically money laundering schemes for Russian oligarchs which double as bribes to get Trump to be pro-russia, my guess is that no, his foreign sources will not dry up."
12-2-2-4,Somewhat like Arthur Anderson where the fines were whatever but the reputation damage and hoops they had to jump thru to conduct business ended them?
12-2-2-4-1,"The point of this trial was to get statements on the record. These statements can then be used in the civil case against the family, seeking to obtain $250 million *and* bar him and his immediate family from holding any corporate leadership roles in a New York Corporation, and remove them from their current roles in the Trump Organization. It effectively means they can’t be in charge of any business that operates in New York, which is a *huge* blow to him."
12-2-5,They now have a record as a felonious company.  Real companies hate that. I wonder what Trump will do.  It seems clear he’s guilty of conspiracy to commit tax fraud.
12-3,"Gosh, when you look at all of this together it almost starts to seem like maybe he's just as incredibly guilty of literally everything he's been accused of by literally every person on the planet not in his weird, creepy little cult."
12-3-1,“That’s our guy!” -Half of the country
12-3-1-1,">“That’s our guy!” -Half of the countryI've saying  this since he got 74 million votes on November 3, 2020.After seeing four years of lunacy and killing many hundreds of thousands during Covid, due to his incompetence. 74 million Americans said ""Yup, that's my guy"""
12-3-1-1-1,It’s fucking embarrassing.
12-3-1-1-1-2,I’m guessing a lot of Germans were embarrassed by Hitler in the 30s too. Maybe embarrassment isn’t enough.
12-3-1-1-1-2-1,Hitler got into office on a minority vote. It was conservatives who thought they could use them and a left too busy hating each other that let him seize power.
12-3-1-1-4,Wait 10 years and you wont be able to find a single person in this country that 'Voted' for Trump.  Like finding someone that voted for Nixon..
12-3-1-1-5,That isn't half of 330 million BTW
12-3-1-2,"It wasn't half the country. It wasn't even half of the voting age population of the country. It was less than 29% of them.And no, that's not meant to downplay the impact. Quite the opposite really."
12-3-2,He is definitely guilty of everything.
12-4,"Wait, you mean to tell me that the Organization that was defrauding a charity they ran also committed tax fraud? I'm shocked /s"
12-4-1,If only the leaders of the organization were held accountable
12-4-1-1,"No fucking kidding. “Oh the corporation has been punished” - and what about the *people who made the decisions*? The corporation isn’t some Marvel villain out there - it’s made of people! Amazing we can get convictions of Epstein’s girlfriend and his estate without a single man who raped a child being named from the trial, Trump and his spawn rip off the government but it’s just the company punished. It’s a god damn mystery."
12-4-1-1-1,"We got convictions of people whose crimes were paid for by Trump, requested by Trump and for the benefit of Trump. Plus the small matter of the mob trying to overthrow democracy for him. Years later, DoJ is still ***thinking*** about whether it's really the right time to press charges against Trump for anything.Meanwhile: ["
12-4-2,"I totally think he should eradicate the constitution because the founders are fucking him. Also the DOJ, NYAG, almost all the judges he appointed, with the exception of one very good and very talented judge in Florida... The AG of Georgia, Congress, Biden and his son, Bill Barr, the jurors who found his company guilty, FBI, His daughter and son in law, the guy who cuts his hair, any and all ""RINOs"" Ringo Star, bone spurs, taxes and the IRS, Atlantic City, Ron Desantis, GOD... Im missing a few but you get the point.On a complete side note I can't wait to see how far off the deep end this one sends him and look forward to his next verbal vomit session (almost forgot Jeff Sessions) I need the laughs its been a long day."
12-5,"Hopefully Warnock wins today, making it a trifecta of bad news for Trump today."
12-5-1,What's the second thing?
12-5-1-1,I’m guessing that the Jan 6 committee is making criminal referrals
13,A group of high schoolers in Tulsa ditched class to sneak into a Trump rally and get this pic taken before being swiftly escorted out.
13-1,Fuckin legends
13-1-1,"This, and the time the kids booked all the tickets for  a Trump rally so he was addressing a mostly empty hall, gives me hope for the future."
13-1-1-2,> a Trump rallyDo trump rallys still exist? or are both of these from years past?
13-1-1-2-1,This incident was a couple of years ago 
13-1-1-2-2,"Yep, next one is Jan 28.   He is starting up his run for 2024, and making sure to scam every penny he can out of the pockets of his cult."
13-1-1-2-3,"He has had a few since leaving office.  Something no other President has done that I know of.But, Trump says he is running again and I think he has a rally coming up soon in North Carolina in just a few weeks."
13-1-1-3,"That rally was in Tulsa too. Maybe the same event. Tulsa rally was also the day for the public to see former Presidential candidate and COVID denier, Herman Cain, for the last time. He died from COVID complications a couple weeks later."
13-1-2,I hope they got extra credit in civics class.
13-1-2-1,"Civics hasn't been a requirement for a long time, so I'd give them extra credit in American History... assuming that is still a requirement"
13-1-2-1-1,Not in Florida
13-1-2-1-2,According to MAGA... this never happened.  They just remembered it being a beautiful speech... such a beautiful speech.
13-1-2-1-2-4,"Whenever he does that with his hands, I always imagine that he is squeezing a big pair of titties, but he doesn’t know what to do with them."
13-1-2-1-3,Not in Mississippi either. Civics or US history...
13-1-2-1-3-1,I heard Mississippi actually has segregated schools still.
13-1-2-1-3-1-3,Was at an elementary in MS in the early 90s. White teacher definitely had African American kids and white kids in two separate reading groups. Guess which group she spent more time with?
13-1-2-1-5,Sad i had to take AP govt to truly learn how the govt works and what my civic duty was. Ridiculous its not requirement in most places. Thank hod for US govt teachers most of you are saints that hold this broke country together.
13-1-2-2,Civics? Lmao. Civics isn’t a thing anymore and Republicans wouldn’t want students learning how the government works anyway.
13-1-3,"May their names be whispered through the halls of highschools, especially for properly using a ditch day"
13-1-3-2,Ditch Day Legends
13-1-3-4,"Fuck whispering. May their names be roared and regaled. May songs be written that shake the halls. May the story of this deed sweep across the country as the legends who owned the ex president like a bitch reach his ear daily, for nothing will anger this troll more than that chant. Trump the Chump who was put to shame by the youth for the adults were too weak to stand up."
13-1-4,This happened in 2016 apparently it's been 7 years since 2016 I thought that was 4 years ago.Heck yeah they are LEGENDS.
13-1-4-1,we're really coming up on a decade of this shit show already
13-1-4-1-1,Decade? It’s been over half* a century :(
13-1-5,"> Awesome young people.> > It's my daughter, her friends and kids like those in the photo that allow me to hang on to a bit of hope for the future."
13-2,The kids are alright.
13-2-1,younger people voting is by far the country's best defense against fascism
13-2-1-1,"The thing about fascists is that they don't give a fuck about your vote.Edit: ""Hitler was elected"" - time to read up on your history."
13-2-1-1-1,"I mean I ""get that"" but also the track record seems to show that fascists (on a modern sense) have had a more successful record being voted in rather than seizing power per the early 20th century.Seeing as this is getting attention go check out coolzone media podcasts. Specifically behind the bastards, and it could happen here. The first is about bastards of history and talks about fascists taking power like Napoleon the 3rd and Mussolini, etc. Great size partner in Kissinger too.But ""It could happen here"" is about how society very easily can and is moving to fall apart. But more importantly it also talks about what you as a person can do to help counteract that."
13-2-1-1-1-1,Jan 6 could've been a lot worse if the gun nuts brought their guns. The fact it took so long to deal with SOME of the people who participated does not give me confidence.They're gonna do it again.
13-2-1-1-1-1-1,I want you to be wrong. But I am afraid you're are right. Like beer hall putsch 2023?Fuck it's been 100 years... that seems ominously significant.
13-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,"Or like Mussolini’s March. (In which, like Trump, he didn’t personally participate.)"
13-2-1-1-4,Trump does
13-2-2,"The children are our future, and they know that the future looks bleak"
13-2-2-2,Persistent pessimism seems more like a boomer thing to me
13-2-3,Good! I’m gonna go finish my landscaping project then brush my hair.
13-2-3-1,Call Four Seasons for all your landscaping needs!
13-2-3-1-1,The good people at This Is Shoe Polish Not Hair Dye Inc. would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that shoe polish is not a safe or sufficient substitute for hair dye. Not even in a pinch.
13-2-3-1-3,Don't forget the porn store that was next door.
13-2-3-1-3-1,...where you can buy a video of America getting fucked by Trump  for 4 years.
13-2-3-1-3-1-1,I think we are going to be fucked longer than that with his followers still pushing his bullshit.

13-3-1,They're always angry.
13-3-1-1,Yeah. They need no incentive to be angry. They’re just ready to be angry.
13-4,That's what highschoolers SHOULD be doing.  Good for them.
13-4-1,"I would be so proud if any of my kids did this. If the police called me to pick my kid up after this, we would have so much fun celebrating"
13-4-1-2,That'd be my christmas card for that year.  I'm the only non-Magat in my immediate family.
13-4-1-2-1,"I know the feel, the batshit QAnon people in my family are at least not immediate (uncle, and brother in law mostly, but my sister is also pretty close to this level of delusional), the rest are insufferable Trump voters with the majority being anti-mask, anti-vax, etc.  I even live in a blue state"
13-4-1-2-1-1,Your family sucks!(Mines the same… sigh)
13-4-1-2-1-1-1,"Mine thought the sun shone outta Thatcher's ass, can I join you guys pls?"
13-4-1-2-1-3,"Me too....also some lifelong friends whom I can never look at the same ever again and it's heartbreaking. Trumpism has literally ruined my life. I wonder if this is how sane, non-Nazi Germans felt back in the 1930's?"
13-4-1-2-2,Glad that I'm not an American because I just know that my dad would get suckered into maga.
13-4-1-2-2-1,"Dude you don’t even have to be American. Q-anon shit is global now, it’s (very literally) insane. People in Germany or Australia or wherever think Donald Trump is gunna catch all the pedos. It just keeps getting weirder."
13-4-1-4,At the bare minimum ice cream on the way home.
13-4-1-4-1,Winners get sprinkles kids! Load up!
13-4-1-4-1-1,Sprinkles are for winners!Sprinkles all around.
13-4-2,It would be something if the next generation decides to make political activism a focus again for the youths
13-4-2-2,I’d be so proud if this took place.
13-4-4,To be honest.  I'm glad they were not hurt.  I do not trust that crowd to decide children are not an acceptable target.
13-4-4-3,Oh definitely. I would feel so much safer letting my child walk around an antifa riot with a MAGA hat. Talk about safe and sound!
13-4-4-3-3,What is antifa?
13-4-4-3-3-1,If you’re FoxNews it’s the gift that keeps on giving.
13-4-4-3-4,What is an AntiFa rally?
13-4-4-3-4-1,"The adamant ""antifa isn't an organization"" crowd are so bizarre to me. ""People who associate themselves with antifa and gather people together and yell ignorant shit on megaphones"" better for you?I'll just change rally to riot. More suiting in 99% of circumstances anyway."
13-4-4-3-4-1-1,oh.  So you don't know what a rally or a riot is.  Thanks for clarifying
13-4-4-3-4-1-1-1,"""a mass meeting of people making a political protest or showing support for a cause."" That's the definition of a rally. Antifa never does this you totally got me. I'm embarrassed now "
13-4-5,"I went to a Quaker high school, and they would actually provide buses for us to go to anti-war protests!"
13-5,"Salut to these high schoolers, don't say America is doomed. You still got young people like this doing what they should be doing."
13-5-1,america is only doomed when people support republicans
13-5-1-2,Or when people who claim they want change refuse to do anything at all other than talk leaving the door open for unhinged extremists to take actions completely unchecked by the government or the people.
14,White House records turned over to House show 7-hour gap in Trump phone log on Jan. 6
14-1,18 minute gap for Watergate and over 7 hours for Jan 6.   Can't wait to hear the details.
14-1-1,Literally 20 times worse than Watergate.
14-1-1-1,~~the math checks out~~wait... no it's 23.3333x worse
14-1-1-1-1,"Repeating, of course"
14-1-1-1-1-1,That’s a lot better than we usually do
14-1-1-1-1-1-1,Alright chums let's do this.
14-1-1-1-1-2,At least I have chicken...
14-1-2,"Watergate is basically why Fox News exists though, to ensure that Republicans always have a platform to spread their propaganda first before reporters can get the whole story. Considering how many people just don't believe Trump was in any way involved in 1/6 and no amount of evidence will convince them, I'd say that Fox News and the entire conservative media ecosystem has been pretty damned effective.We didn't see people supporting Nixon for years afterwards completely convinced of his innocence, I'm wondering if people will still fly Trump flags in like 10 years thinking that 1/6 was an ANTIFA false flag or something."
14-1-2-1,Of course they will.  They still fly Confederate Flags 150yrs afterwards
14-1-2-1-1,Correct they love the flags of losers.
14-1-2-1-1-1,"i dunno from where i'm sitting it looks like they just like losers in general, not just their flags lol."
14-1-2-1-1-1-1,"They are technically losers but Facebook boosted Fox News propaganda makes them winners who will get to rewrite our textbooks and codify their propaganda into sources of record.That's why Barr the crooked AG, aided Trump and his allies with impunity; they believe they will win the war to erase facts from history just as the United Daughters of the Confederacy did with the confederacy.  UDC were the Fox News of the Civil War and succeeded in white washing human atrocities like slavery into antebellum nostalgia.That's why they're fighting so hard to block the boogeymen they call critical race theory.  Republicans block truth by any means necessary.*Edited to correct the name of the group from DAR to UDC.*"
14-1-2-2,When the downfall of America is examined it will go back to the Kennedy assassination and the escalation to the Vietnam War. The next thing will be not prosecuting Nixon and him doing real prison time. We can trace where we are today right back to that.
14-1-2-2-1,"> When the downfall of America is examined it will go back to the Kennedy assassination and the escalation to the Vietnam War.Nope. It starts at Reconstruction. We literally let the CSA back in with 0 punishment.>The next thing will be not prosecuting Nixon and him doing real prison time.Worse than that, Nixon was given a full pardon. Nixon couldn't be prosecuted even if we wanted to."
14-1-2-2-1-1,"I agree with it starting at Reconstruction. Just imagine if after WWII, Germany was allowed to build a narrative of the Nazis as the good guys, make up a retroactive reason for the war,build statues and monuments to Hitler and their favourite generals, write books and movies about the noble Nazis, fighting for their lives against the brutal Allies, a popular TV show paints a Nazi flag on the top of a car and people reminisce about the Nazis rising again."
14-1-2-2-1-1-1,"You are correct, and it's what I think about too. I don't know of any other war that the losers are so venerated like CSA losers. I mean Jefferson Davis has a statue in the fucking US Capitol. I'd add that people claiming Nazi heritage would be flying the flags in France, England, and other invaded countries because of the ""heritage"". Like could you imagine seeing a pegueot toodling around France with a Nazi flag with ""These colors don't run"" like we see in the US?"
14-1-2-2-1-1-3,"Not hard to imagine at all - consider tRump's bosom buddies in The Proud Boys being asked to STAND BY, and how they answered donny's activation order to storm the Capitol. And yes, it got started when Lincoln was assassinated - here's a seldom mentioned timeline that pretty clearly demonstrates we COULD have changed our history very much for the better.March 1862 - Revenue Act of 1862 calls for seizure of Confederate lands for ""unpaid taxes"" and redistribution of seized land to ex-slaves. Jan 1865 - GEN Sherman's Field Order #15 seized 400,000 acres along coast in SC and FL and gave it to ex-slavesApril 1865 - Lincoln assassinated.March 1865 President Johnson pardons most Confederates and allows them to recover their seized land and property.Think how things would be now if former slaves -instead of the former slave OWNERS -had all that wealth to pass to their heirs. We COULD have impoverished a few thousand slavers and enfranchised several million freed men and women."
14-1-2-2-1-2,>Nope. It starts at Reconstruction. We literally let the CSA back in with 0 punishment.Not even punishment. We never made them fix their problem of millions of uneducated generationally traumatized black citizens. We let them perpetuate Jim Crow laws to the point that millions fled north. It was the equivalent of giving homeless people busfare to another state.
14-1-2-2-1-2-1,"Giving them land would probably have been the best move. 40 acres and a mule still sounds like a legit method of helping them. A lot of black people moved to Texas or Colorado to homestead. In Texas you can grow cotton, so it's a very logical choice. Not sure what they grew in Colorado. I think I would take the land from the planters and redistribute it. Not sure what to do with the planters, I feel like hanging them or exiling them or something lol. They thought they were a noveau aristocracy, so exiling them to Europe where they can be constantly embarrassed/made fun of by the real European aristocracy would be funny."
14-1-2-4,"The fact that he was elected at all after the Access Hollywood tapes tells me all I need to know. His base will NEVER hold him accountable. I don't understand why, but it's true."
14-1-2-4-2,"Immediately after the Access Hollywood video, Oliver Stone coordinated with Russian wikileaks to release the DNC files to distract(and not the RNC files that were hacked at the same time)."
14-1-3,Seven hours of Trump singing Alice’s Restaurant.
14-1-3-2,But will they find the glossy 8x10 color photos with the circles and the arrows and the paragraph written on the back of each one?
14-1-5,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.  ***DONALD TRUMP IS A TRAITOR TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY.***
14-2,I like how trump says he has no idea what a burner phone is.  Its insulting.  He absolutely knows.
14-2-1,"The dead giveaway is if he actually didn't know what one was he'd be pretending to know, and know more than anyone.  Maybe even claim he invented burner phones."
14-2-1-1,"""I know more about burner phones than the employees of the Burner company! I'm the best burner phone expert. There are people who say that there's never been an expert like me."""
14-2-1-1-1,"‘In fact, the Burner CEO once met me at Mar A Lago and said, “Sir, if you weren’t so busy making America great again, I’d step down and make you the CEO of my company”. Great guy. Smart guy… though not as smart as me, of course. Very attractive wife. And daughter.’"
14-2-1-1-1-1,"Ah yes, that famous CEO, Tim Burner"
14-2-1-1-1-1-2,Tim Burners-Lee
14-2-2,This is a person who was in charge of national security for 4 years.
14-2-2-1,"Like a year into his presidency there were a bunch of articles about how dangerous it was that trump constantly used his unsecured personal iphone, and what a massive security risk that was. In an angry, all caps tweet trump denied ever doing so, or even having an iphone. He blamed the fake news media for making things up. The tweet ended with, ""sent from twitter for iphone"""
14-2-2-1-1,Wasn’t there also an issue with him throwing classified reports in the trash?
14-2-2-1-1-1,only the ones he didn't try to eat
14-2-2-1-1-2,he literally clogged his toilet trying to flush incriminating evidence.  which pretty much sums up Dunghill Trump's presidency...
14-2-2-1-2,"It might have been Dan Scavino, his social media guy. He had a hobbit-hole of a cubby right outside the Oval Office. When 45 wanted to send a tweet during business hours, he’d bellow *SCAVINO!*, who’d come scurrying in to type up whatever banality came out of 45’s mouth. For this, he was paid $200K per year, and government benefits."
14-2-3,We have a Supreme Court justice that claimed  that a Devil’s Threeway is a drinking game.
14-2-3-1,"Don't forget he also defined Boofing for us as ""Farting"""
14-2-3-1-4,"I'm still confused how he got away with blatantly lying under oath?... Like, isn't that supposed to have consequences? How anyone can work with or remotely trust or respect this guy after that is completely beyond me."
14-2-4,"I mean, he's been using burner phones all along.>The president uses at least two iPhones, according to one of the officials. The phones — one capable only of making calls, the other equipped only with the Twitter app and preloaded with a handful of news sites — are issued by White House Information Technology and the White House Communications Agency, an office staffed by military personnel that oversees White House telecommunications.>While aides have urged the president to swap out the Twitter phone on a monthly basis, Trump has resisted their entreaties, telling them it was “too inconvenient,” the same administration official said.>The president has gone as long as five months without having the phone checked by security experts. It is unclear how often Trump’s call-capable phones, which are essentially used as burner phones, are swapped out."
14-2-4-1,A burner phone is discarded. These are official devices issued (and presumably recollected) by the White House IT department.
14-2-4-2,He used to borrow his body guard's phone to talk to Stormy Daniels.
14-2-5,Have to give credit where credit is due: Trump is the all time master of getting what he wants by being an absolute fucking moron.
14-2-5-1,Or pretending to be when it suits him
14-2-5-1-1,"I find this to be the most compelling argument. He has moments of dumb, but he's dumb like a fox, and knows how to play to his base. A sound-bite like that is all they'll hear on OAN or AM Hate Radio."
14-2-5-2,"Not giving him enough credit. He also intentionally doesn't text or email. I mean we can beat up on him for being a moron all we want, but the fact is, he became the president of the United States, as an obvious career criminal and con artist. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking he's just bumbling his way through and accidentally succeeding. He's taking conscious, willful steps to disguise criminality, and it fucking works. It might not work one day, but it works right now."
14-3,"Obstruction of justice, plain as day. Makes Nixon’s famous tape gap look like nothing. If we can’t prosecute this, we literally have no Justice Department."
14-3-1,"Nixon was a damn saint compared to the level of corruption we are seeing from king clown and his merry band of morons. Whats crazy is this is what we know, but just think how bad the stuff we don’t know about is. He gets back in and this country is done. I doubt if we will recover and i think he will plan to stay on the throne for life. Or at least try to."
14-3-1-1,Something 10 times worse than all of the things Nixon ever did put together wouldn't torpedo a political career today
14-3-1-1-1,"Eh, as a presidential candidate in 1968 Nixon sabotaged Vietnam war peace talks to help his election campaign. That's pretty damn bad."
14-3-1-1-1-1,"And yet, that still pales in comparison to Trump following Kushner's strategy of letting COVID-19 run rampant because it would hit highly populated, aka ""blue,"" regions most severely at first."
14-3-1-1-1-1-2,"Nixon followed Kissinger's advice in bombing neutral Cambodia and Laos secretly, without approval or funding from Congress, in a campaign that killed actual millions. They also very deliberately started the War on Drugs with the goal of breaking up communities aligned with the left, specifically black and anti-war leftists, by criminalizing the drugs most commonly used by those groups worse than drugs used by Conservative or wealthy whites more.Nixon was objectively worse, Trump only comes close for sheer incompetence."
14-3-1-1-1-4,"trump set us on this course with COVID intentionally, and there's no change in direction after we started. It was permission for a broken misinformed mindset that lead to us reaching over a million American deaths. Our numbers would have been dramatically lower if a decent, basically competent person had been in office in January 2020."
14-3-1-1-2,"Nixon paid Muskie's driver to photocopy all of the democratic parties files/memos/strategies/intel basically letting him pick McGovern (one of the most polarizing candidates, someone multiple people in the democratic party said they wouldnt vote for) as his opponent. If you think the DNC email leak was bad, this was on a whole other level."
14-3-1-1-2-1,I'm just saying I can't think of anything Trump could say or do that would legitimately end his political clout. Making foie gras out of newborn human children wouldn't get it done.
14-3-1-1-2-1-1,"As long as they are newborn and not unborn, that might cost him four or five voters."
14-3-1-1-2-1-1-2,Nah they wouldn't care about the unborn either. They just like punishing and controlling other people's bodies
14-3-1-1-2-1-1-3,Fair point there
14-3-1-3,"At this point, if *republicans* get back in this country is done. Don’t think for a second the GOP will stop if trump fails. They’re absolutely working on Trump 2.0 for a better chance at a successful coup if this edition actually does face consequences."
14-3-1-4,"Even if he doesn't get reelected, the damage has been done. If he isn't held accountable and we don't fix all of the issues that have been exposed then our democracy is over. The next wannabe dictator won't be so incompetent."
14-3-1-5,"I hope to fuck we on the EU are presuming he is gonna get back in, your country is done and we are acting accordingly. hope for the best but plan for the worst. the 4 years he was in was pure misery. can't imagine how despressing that shit is when it's your own country.I think Irish times journo fintan o toole said it best. it's strange feeling pity for the US, we have loved you, hated you feared you, envied you; but never pitied you."
14-3-2,"Nixon was, broadly, more competent and despite being an absolute shit bag had some beliefs, even if he was wrong about most things.Nixon's greatest crime was the destroying of the negotiations to end the Vietnam war with Kissinger. That was both treason and cost the lives of millions. Weirdly it isn't mentioned as much, LBJ decided to keep quiet as it may have destabilised the faith in the American system. That was the sliding doors moment."
14-3-2-2,"Additionally, he didn't disclose it as his source was the bugs the US had placed on South Vietnam (their ally). Would have been very diplomatically awkward, alongside undermining trust in the system."
14-3-2-2-1,"LBJ had Hoover bug NIXON’S CAMPAIGN. He couldn’t release the incriminating info because he would have had to admit he was bugging a political rival.He brought Hubert Humphrey (Nixon’s opponent in ‘68) to the White House to tell him both that he had the dirt on Nixon and that he’d decided not to release it. Humphrey had been closing the gap in the polls, and this revelation would have likely put him over the top, but he agreed they couldn’t tell anyone. It was the angriest anybody has ever seen “The Happy Warrior.”"
14-3-3,"I hate to be the one to tell you this, but we have no justice system at least not one for the rich people sinking this ship."
14-3-3-1,"At this point I believe Trump could've just shot Biden dead on TV and he wouldn't be prosecuted for it...Conservative Media would show his dead body on the floor and joke about ""sleepy Joe""...."
14-3-3-3,It’s a Just-Us system.
14-3-4,"This…so muchTo me, it doesn’t matter which one of the dozen crimes he’s committed, prosecute one of them or just admit or system is fucking rigged for the rich & powerful."
14-3-5,"The fact that he isnt in prison right fucking now should be incredibly alarming to the people who can understand what is happening. This is one of those little things, like all the little things before, that help us to not be surprised by what happens next."
14-4,so they didnt turn over the recordsisnt that like fighting the law... republicans are just resisting arrest at this point
14-4-1,"No, it doesn't count, they are white. White people can't resist arrest, I've been informed. Some say it doesn't even count as a crime if they are the perpetrators! But if you are NOT white (Or rich and orange), be careful doing... Anything, really."
14-4-1-1,"Nah see, you missing an important part, you cannot just be white, you gotta be rich AND white."
14-4-1-1-1,"Correct. That's a very important distinction. White privilege only goes so far. A ""get out of jail free card"" costs money. You might get a discount for being white, but you still have to pay the price"
14-4-1-1-1-2,"Poor white guy here. Our ""Get Out of Jail free"" card extends to sometimes getting a warning for tickets and a reduced chance of being murdered during routine police contacts. It's definitely something, but getting the GOOJ Platinum card has a minimum income requirement that no one bullshitting here will ever attain."
14-4-1-1-1-3,Hey I’ll take a discount any day better than walking around like some of us whom are usually guilty until proven innocent..
14-4-1-1-1-3-2,"I 100% agree. However, the privilege card we were issued at birth comes with a ""this privilege is non-transferable"" disclaimer on it."
14-4-1-1-1-5,Fig Nutts.
14-4-1-1-1-5-1,I'll bet your lymph nodes are as big as cats!
14-4-1-1-2,r/FloridaMan has a lot of good examples of this
14-4-1-1-4,Cause there’s no rich black people? Lmao
14-4-3,Nixon having gaps in the record are a large part of what ultimately brought that rapacious criminal down.  And Trump is far worse.
14-4-4,I wonder what the overlap of times are in regards to this dead zone when compared to the twitter posts on that day.
14-4-5,"""They"" here is the Biden administration so they did turn over all the records. The Trump admin kept something out of the records (or removed something).This is still important because we have a lot of evidence Trump communicated with people that day so we can narrow down how that communication occurred."
14-5,Here's the article by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that this report is based on:[The Washington Post.][Mirror.]
14-5-1,"That Woodward is managing this sort of reporting twice, 50 years apart, is nothing short of extraordinary"
14-5-1-1,"The Woodward books on Trump were entertaining. In case you didn't know, he wrote the first one and Trump reached out to him to give him interviews for the next one himself. The insight into Trump isn't surprising other than that he openly supports just about everything you already think about him in almost a bragging way.It's impressive he is so brazen but then again the man has never faced consequences in his life so why would he now?"
14-5-1-1-1,"I remember when the Woodward audio tapes of him interviewing Donald in early to early-mid 2020 were released to the public a few months before the election where Donald talked outloud and admitting downplaying the severity of the pandemic from the start despite knowing it was going to be bad.   I naively thought that this will certainly be the end of his overall general support for him from the Republican Party, right?   Well it turns it out, while he did lose the election thankfully,  he still got even more votes than the 2016 election."
14-5-1-1-2,He was not joking when he said he believed he could get away with shooting someone on 5th avenue. I don’t know why people assumed that was a joke
14-5-1-1-2-1,">I don’t know why people assumed that was a jokeRight? People who aren't Donald Trump get away with murder. He would positively walk free unless it was a wealthier, whiter person than himself on the receiving end.He got 5 people killed on Jan 6 at the Capitol and 14 months later there are no charges. How many extra hundreds of thousands died because he said COVID would ""disappear"" in April 2 years ago?\#fascistbananarepublic"
14-5-1-2,It must be so disheartening to work your ass off then have the president essentially get away with it then to have a repeat 50 years later with the same result.
14-5-1-2-1,"..and even more disheartening knowing that the first time, it caused a sitting President to resign for the first and last time ever, and the second time, you are fairly well convinced there will be no meaningful consequences."
15,"Trump lunged at Secret Service agent in rage when told he couldn’t go to Capitol on Jan. 6, aide testifies"
15-1,"This whole thing is surreal. Michael Flynn literally pleaded the fifth when directly asked if he believes in the process of a peaceful transition of power. Trump literally said ""he deserves it"" when told that the Jan 6 insurrectionists were threatening to hang Pence."
15-1-1,"Bingo. I mean, this story about the limo is remarkable...But FFS, the President KNEW there were weapons at the ellipse. Not only did he know, but he actively took steps to get them onto the ellipse (demanding removal of the magnetometers)...And he knew at 10am, before his speech, that there was already violence and weapons AT THE CAPITOL. And, according to the testimony, he WANTED NOTHING DONE. JFC... This is Direct evidence of encouragement and approval."
15-1-1-1,"He told Meadows that he wanted nothing done, which means there's likely a recording or some kind of record of that too."
15-1-1-1-1,"I'm confused why no one is discussing the Giuliani dig at the beginning, where Giuliani told her on his way out of the White House that Jan 6 was going to be a huge deal and referenced the proud boys.  That was a huge signal to the proud boys, Giuliani, and anyone else involved that they at least suspect there were direct ties from the White House down to them.  If its proved that the proud boys led the insurrection at the direction/coordination of Giuliani and the White House, that could actually rise to the level of treason in so far as it ""levied war against the United States"".  At a bare minimum, it's insurrection."
15-1-1-1-1-1,"""Stand Back, Stand By"""
15-1-1-1-1-1-2,"That one always bugged me. Still does—especially after what I’ve seen of today’s scorching testimony.  I could say a lot more about scorching, but would almost assuredly be banned for it, so I’ll beg off and just say “scene”."
15-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,"The president was openly courting a fascist group on national tv, of course it still bugs you, it bugs everyone."
15-1-1-1-1-2,"The witness saying that Meadows communicated with Roger Stone (and Flynn? I thing) about the ""war room"" stuff on 1/5, which appears to have included the terrorist attack groups from the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers seems to be a huge deal.  If Trump knew that these terrorist squads were involved on top of the mob, which he knew was armed, that's whipped cream and a cherry on top of his criminal sundae."
15-1-1-1-1-3,"Yeah and the ""command center"" at the Willard. Which, is pretty much in between the Capitol and White House and has a pretty good view of the Elipse."
15-1-1-2,We also haven’t (yet) heard why the national guard was delayed so long.  Guessing the hamburger guy had something to do with that delay.
15-1-1-2-1,Secret Service agent did Trump a favor by not going to the capital. If… “Oh yes Mr. President it would be a great idea for you to lead the March straight into the Capital Building. You should be the one to hold the rope to hang Pence and the Dems who oppose you. Great idea!”
15-1-1-2-1-1,"God. Imagine if we were dealing with the aftermath of *that* reality… and of course, everyone who’s in lockstep with Trump today would be making a completely different set of excuses for why he’s in the right.Instead of the justifications of “oh he wasn’t responsible for this riot, clearly there were Antifa agitators drumming up chaos to make him look bad,” we’d be hearing “well yeah he instigated all this… but what choice did he have?! He’s the last bastion of hope fighting for American democracy”… and it’d be coming from THE SAME DAMN PEOPLE!"
15-1-1-2-1-1-2,We’d probably be in a civil war already if that had happened
15-1-1-2-1-1-2-1,One wonders what was going through peoples minds in the north and south in the months and weeks leading to the firing on Fort Sumter. Feels like it is mostly political discourse until the day it isn’t.
15-1-1-2-1-1-3,Maybe the real treasure was the fascism we revealed along the way....
15-1-1-5,"The JFC part is people still believe he was a strong leader, instead of a worthless  POS"
15-1-1-5-1,"Those people will see the planning that went into this and say, ""See, he is smart."""
15-1-1-5-1-1,Smart as a cornered sewer rat.
15-1-3,part of the reason this all so surreal is because for a long time we have labored to view the republican party as a legitimate democratic political constituency. there's always been a sense that the extremes are just the crazy people on the fringe of the party.today we know that the *core* of the party (from supreme court justices to legislators to presidents) is a tyrannical machine doing its best to put an end to freedom.viewed properly as a fascist hate group their behavior is less surreal and makes a lot more sense.
15-1-5,I bet trumps biggest fantasy is people killing other people for him.  That would just boost his ego.  No remorse.  Just ego.
15-1-5-1,He is a giant ball of pure need for adulation.  He’s a grotesque.
15-1-5-1-1,"He's all seven sins wrapped up in one. How can the evangelical right even pretend to tolerate that man? Just goes to show how easily duped that lot is, and how hypocritical their beliefs are."
15-1-5-1-1-1,Trump is the one man that can make me almost sincerely believe in Jesus because his story resembles so many American White Christian antichrist prophecies. The most vocal Christians are the ones who worship him as a cult leader and he embodies pretty much the exact opposite values of their Christ.
15-1-5-1-1-1-1,"Self fulfilling prophecy for them. You don't have to believe in the supernatural to recognize that grifters will take advantage of gullible people, using their faith as a means to achieve their own ends, be it riches, or power, or both."
15-2,"Mark Meadows said that when the president said he wanted to go the Capitol, that Trump meant it metaphorically. Lies."
15-2-2,He also tried to choke the head of his secret service detail... metaphorically speaking.
15-3,"""I dont care if they have weapons (His rioters). They are not here to hurt me. Get rid of the magnetic detectors."" &#x200B;PSYCHO!!"
15-3-1,I thought it was antifa?
15-3-1-1,She even revealed that they had discussions about whether to blame it all on BLM and ANTIFA or not.100% of their lies are out in the open and Republican supporters are just choosing to pretend they don’t exist.
15-3-1-1-1,Yeah. I saw that. That whole testimony was eye opening. I figured stuff like that was going on but my god.
15-3-1-1-1-1,"Seriously... It's all the shit we suspected, just now on public record.  And a quarter of the country will still deny it"
15-3-1-1-1-1-1,Because they're a cult. It's honestly not an exaggeration at this point. They're a brainwashed cult that needs to be right. Being a Republican is their identity. So they'll now deny what they see with their own eyes and deny what they hear with their own ears. They'll deny reality.
15-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,It hasn't been an exaggeration for years.
15-3-1-1-1-1-1-2,Well they're already in religious cults - fundamentalists are not typically known for their ability to distinguish fact from fiction.
15-3-1-1-1-1-1-3,They won’t believe it until they’re “marched through the concentration camps to see the dead.” Then it will only be one generation before fascism rears its ugly head again. The price for freedom is eternal vigilance.
15-3-2,"""Psycho"" removes agency and therefore culpability. Trump was not ""psycho;"" he was deliberately enabling violence in furtherance of his coup attempt. He knew exactly what he was doing."
15-3-2-1,"If he meant 'psychotic' then yes, it would remove agency. He probably meant 'psychopath' which would maintain his agency/culpability."
15-4,"Yeah this and the ""I don't fucking care if they're armed. Let my people in!"" shit will be bombs from the first half"
15-4-2,"“They’re not here to harm me,” is an admittance that he knew they were here to harm Congress."
15-4-2-1,"Yes, the correct emphasis is “They’re not here to harm *me*”"
15-4-2-1-1,"He's such a fucking weasel. Honestly, how does it keep it *on* all the time?They'll easily say, ""They're not here to harm me \[or anyone\]"""
15-4-2-1-1-1,"That is more than being a weasel, imo.  He's a psychopath when you consider that statement with the statement he made about Pence deserving death by hanging."
15-4-2-2,RICO charges are officially valid here.
15-4-2-3,"Perhaps so, perhaps not...but directing *protestors that you know are armed* to march on the Capitol strengthens the criminal intent idea."
15-4-2-4,Ding-ding-ding.  That was my take as well. This motherfucker knew exactly what was gonna go down.
15-5,"Unhinged, impulsive, narcissistic, and violent. Trump has never met consequences or been told ""no"" for anything and it shows.   Imagine being someone who voted for him and realizing there is no bottom to his failure."
15-5-2,"These hearings are a test for his supporters straight up. I wonder if a lot of them still consider this shit ""fake news"".For me though, I'm being vindicated and I'm seeing sides to Trump I would've joked about happening previously.... but now they'd actually make sense to say.Like, he actually *would* throw his McDonalds at the wall because he's so upset, holy shit. He actually *would* try to take control of the car he's in even though he was told he can't.The only thing I was surprised about hearing today was the *extent* of the depravity. I underestimated him."
16,Trump warns ‘terrible things are going to happen’ as he’s blamed for anti-FBI violence
16-1,"He is behaving like a terrorist.  When will the US, or will the US, respond to him like we would any other terrorist organization?"
16-1-1,"“We are all domestic terrorists.” —GOP    >The 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) took place in Dallas, Texas, from Aug. 4-7, featuring Republican notables such as former U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, as well as an assortment of panel discussions.>A digital banner displayed during one of those panel discussions became the subject of controversy when photographs and video clips of it went viral on social media. The banner read: “We Are All Domestic Terrorists.”"
16-1-1-1,"I’m sorry? How is that allowed? Like how can a senator just be like “I’m a domestic terrorist!” and we’re all like “darn, guess we have to vote harder!” This is lunacy at this point."
16-1-1-1-1,"Seriously! I get that’s it free speech, but how is that not a threat?"
16-1-1-1-1-1,"if mentioning the word ""bomb"" at airports gets you in trouble then surely there shouldd at least be a stern ""don't fucking do that."""
16-1-1-1-1-2,Gee it's almost like totally unrestricted lies and incitement aren't good speech to have huh
16-1-1-1-1-2-1,Exactly this. Free speech absolutism has failed.The child throws a tantrum because they want everything. The adult is disciplined and wise enough to know that he must be subjected to some common sense boundaries.
16-1-1-1-1-4,"As soon as the next domestic terrorism act hits the U.S. we'll be able to put all those faces underneath this banner and they won't shy away from it, right?"
16-1-1-3,So what’s the context here. Why did they have that up there. Was it satire?
16-1-1-3-1,"it's a ""joke"" implying that democrats will call anyone they disagree with ""domestic terrorists""and the point obviously is downplaying the literal domestic terrorists who tried to overthrow the election, and who will continue acts of domestic terrorism in the future. very unsettling imo"
16-1-1-3-2,"They're trying to turn something serious into a joke so that any blowups from their obviously violent stupidity can't be easily pinned on them.  If all conservatives are ""domestic terrorists"" then it's not a bad thing just another label Democrats love to throw around.  Smokescreen for people threatening or using violence to get their way."
16-1-2,>	He is ~~behaving like~~ a terrorist.FTFY
16-1-3,"The atmosphere in this country reminds me of the mid 90s. Hopefully there isn’t another Timothy McVeigh, but I assure you, there is. Once Trump is arrested, there is going to be an explosion of violence, and people will die."
16-2,"""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome FBI?"""
16-2-1,“Peacefully”His supporters: OMG he said peacefully once! It’s obvious he didn’t want anything bad tochappen
16-2-1-1,He DID tell the Jan 6th insurrectionists to go home hours later after everyone in his cabinet and family begged him to.He also told them they were loved awwww
16-2-1-1-1,"Don’t forget during the debate he refused to say stand down but said “stand by”Screw this egotistical dipshit, just silence him already"
16-2-1-1-1-1,Can somebody get a gag order or something?  To stop him from inciting riots?
16-2-1-1-1-1-1,You'd need an actual gag for that. Orders do nothing.
16-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,Lol!  I guess I forgot who I was talking about.  This repulsive excuse of a human being takes orders from NO one.
16-2-1-1-2,"I think the worst part was ""this is what happens when a landslide victory is taken away from real patriots"", as it directly encouraged them"
16-2-1-1-2-2,"I thought you were exaggerating for satirical effect, but holy shit, he actually did tweet, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.”I should have known it wasn’t an exaggeration. With Trump, it’s *never* an exaggeration."
16-2-1-1-2-2-1,"You can’t exaggerate with Trump’s statements because he’s already in the stratosphere of exaggeration. If you aren’t familiar with his Jan 6 tweets, read them all. It’s a horrifying glimpse into the mind of a dictator attempting a coup, with no shame or fear of recrimination."
16-2-1-1-2-3,This is the posturing of a third world dictator. Pull the trigger or sit the fuck down.
16-2-1-1-2-4,Taken away? Lost in court over 60 times. No evidence to back up his claims. Just where is the evidence? Up in the heavens?
16-2-1-1-2-4-1,Just the fact that no one who voted for Trump seems to interact with anyone who didn’t in many parts of the country.The politics as group identity and media bubbles that have been painstakingly created over the last handful of decades really need to be dismantled.
16-2-1-1-2-4-1-3,"The perception that ""we all voted for Trump"" is made worse by people on the other side staying quiet. Some obnoxious guy in a MAGA hat is going on in public truly believing his is the only opinion anyone has. Meanwhile folks who I know are liberal stay quiet, and his belief that ""everyone voted for Trump"" goes unchecked. I usually try to at least say I voted for Biden. Makes some of these guys go nuts, but at least they learn that some people really did."
16-2-1-1-2-5,"They weren't challenged. If the National Guard was there, the Walmart Brigade would have folded immediately."
16-2-1-1-3,He told the Jan 6th insurgents to go home *after he found out the National Guard was disobeying his orders and responding to the Capitol*
16-2-1-1-3-1,I remember reading that he only agreed to say that when people around him started discussing using the 25th amendment to remove him.
16-2-1-1-3-1-1,"Pence was already effectively in control, giving orders that Trump wouldn't, and technically exceeding his authority (?).  It was the right thing to do, but there are all sorts of questions about the legality of it.It's like they never bothered to file the paperwork once the crisis was over, and then decided the next day to pretend like it didn't happen.  They should have followed through and twenty-fifth his butt out of office."
16-2-1-1-4,He said they were special.
16-2-1-1-4-1,"They are some kind of special, for sure. The fact that a US President would say that about an angry, violent mob is still unbelievable, but most of his term was like a nightmare, anyway."
16-2-1-2,"This is Trump's playbook. Say something crazy, let it simmer for a few days, then say the word he's supposed to say so months later when everyone forgets the timeline his supporters can gaslight everyone into thinking it was fake news."
16-2-1-2-1,"This is so sad but true. I don't even think he has to say, they will just say he did or ""well ackwtwallly he meant xyz and it's obvious!"" I heard someone describe the trump cult as the ones who stay in the cave to get points in Plato's Allegory of the Cave and it seems pretty spot on."
16-2-1-3,"He said ""peacefully"" at the beginning of a 2 hour rant against Congress and Mike Pence, in which he said fight over 20 times and said ""you have to take back our country with strength..."" Before he told them he was going to march with them on the Capitol...But he said peacefully right at the beginning... *didn't you hear him*???"
16-2-1-3-1,"Hell, he said it like twice amongst two straight months of angering his base daily, then telling them when and where to gather to express said anger.I always point out to them if his message of peace was remotely sincere or clear, then why didn’t his most ardent followers hear that message?  Wouldn’t they be listening to his every word more than anyone else?"
16-2-1-4,"At some point we need to consider Trump's rhetoric to be a crime in and of itself.When you look at the violence that is happening in the country and things like this...[Murders of police officers rose by nearly 60% during 2021, amid a wider rise in violent crime across the US, according to FBI Director Christopher Wray.]You have to imagine almost all of this (or at least the vast majority) is due to Trump and his rhetoric"
16-2-1-4-1,There is a term for what he does with rhetoric....Stochastic Terrorism
16-2-2,[Context] for those who don't get it. TLDR: Trump is ***asking*** for terrible things to happen.

16-2-3-1,"You say that jokingly, but I could totally imagine Trump saying “Conscience is but a word that cowards use,Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe:Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law”Well maybe not something that eloquent."
16-2-3-1-1,I would pay good money to see him try to parse that quote.
16-2-3-1-1-1,">""Conscience -- that's Greek you know, I knew a Greek guy once, great worker, never paid him a penny you know but he, and all the Greecy people, and Europeans really, you know, great people in Europe those folks, the good ones, not the bad ones, and trust me there are a *lotta* bad ones. My uncle, when I was a child, I love children by the way, they *are* the future of this, and every, all of the, does anyone have a baby for me to kiss? That'd look amazing, wouldn't it?

16-2-4,"James Comey pretty much told us this is how Trump operates in the beginning of the admin.Edit: Yeah, Comey made a mountain out of a mole hill with the Hillary investigation (blame Anthony fucking Weiner and Huma Abedin for bringing it back to the spotlight as well), but it was that same tight ass-ness that made him look into Trump too and ended getting him fired."
16-2-4-1,"And yet, he still made Hillary look shady right before the election."
16-2-4-1-1,But they **had to** reopen the investigation once they discovered an aid who worked for Hillary for years had copies of some emails she sent. How could the FBI have known prior to the week before the election that people you send emails to also have copies of these emails? No one could have known that. /s

16-4-1-1-2-1,Aw snap they got the lil buddy
16-4-1-2,"I don't care.   I keep seeing things like ""the FBI raid might be a political win for Trump"" or ""if we arrest him his supporters might lose it"" and I DON'T CARE.  I don't care if it benefits him politically, I don't care if they lose it. He broke the law, he needs to face consequences. Not following the law because you're scared of the consequences of accountability will be the death knell of our republic.   We aren't Mexico dealing with the cartel, where the police are coerced into inaction for fear of their family's safety. We are a country with arguably the strongest military on the face of this planet, having discussions of whether or not we can hold a civilian accountable for fear of reprisal from his supporters. The fact that this conversation is happening at all is absolutely insane."
16-4-1-2-1,This is exactly cartel tactics of trying to cow government authorities.These are the tactics of a bully and a terrorist.We cannot give in to them.
16-4-1-2-2,Media acting like this is nothing but a political game plays into Trump's small hands.  It's far beyond that.  It's is an existential problem that threatens the basic structure of the nation now.  And the GOP has to go.  They can't be good stewards of the USA government anymore.  They've treated it like one big political opportunity and it's shameful.
16-4-1-3,"If it is going to happen, let it happen now. It's easier to manage it happening with them NOT in power because it makes it easier to prosecute them. We all know the moment they are in power, if something happens, no one will face any repercussions. So it needs to happen sooner than later if it is going to.These idiots think the rest of the world needs to bow to them, their fascism, and their religion."
16-4-1-3-4,"I totally agree that Trump’s prosecution needs to happen inside the Biden administration, because there’s no telling what a republican Congress, White House will do (let him go free/pardon him), BUT there should not be any impropriety or rushing of the justice system. The case needs to be airtight. Can’t have any inkling of doubt about his guilt, otherwise we’re likely looking at incalculable violence from the Trump cult. Chances are we’ll see it regardless, but the less logic ascribed to these lone wolf attacks, perhaps the better for our country as a whole to see that some people are taking things too far. It hurts to type this, knowing no matter what happens, we still have to deal with Trump cult lunatics and their enablers."
16-4-1-4,"It’s a risk we need to take. They’ll explode anyway one way or another. Can’t be like James Buchanan and think placating these people will be good for the country. They’re itching for absolute power and they’ll punish all perceived enemies, laws be damned."
16-4-2,"Taking Trump off social media won't stop this.  This fomenting of violence online on Trump's behalf is coming from all kinds of nefarious places.  The online forums that Trump's base is plugged into are crawling with bots, trolls, and other propaganda artists who want to see this country fall to authoritarianism."
16-4-3,Why isn’t he already under arrest?  That list of stuff they raided from Mar-a-lago looked really damning so I’m confused why he hasn’t been arrested.
16-5,This is a continuation and rejuvenation of the “patriot movement” that hated the FBI and federal government after Waco and created the Timothy Mcveighs you see around us today.  United and grew again after 9/11 and Obamas election.  Confederates.   Militias.  Christian nationalists.  NRA.  Tea Party.  Charlottesville.  Insurrectionist.  Domestic terrorist.  Proud Boys.  OathKeepers.  It’s stronger and organized today because of social media.  
16-5-1,"And law enforcement has dragged its ass the whole time. The Oath Keepers should have been rounded up a decade ago, for example.The US government has been failing at its most basic task of defending the nation for a long time, Trump should have been stopped by the feds before even taking office."

17-1,No noted dissents.
17-1-1,Not even Alito? Ok that's hilarious.
17-1-1-1,"Not even Thomas, that evil motherfucker."
17-1-1-1-1,This is probably better for him. Trump going down for something not related to his wife. And distracting so the public forgets about his wife’s involvement
17-1-1-1-1-1,"Thank you. I’ve been sitting here trying to figure out what Thomas must have really thought. I imagine that his wife is utterly convinced (along with the other crazies) that the Mar-a-Lago Docs investigation is a sham, as she has been in lockstep with most conspiracy theories that she’s been asked about.“Maybe this time, Thomas ruled based on the actual LAW,” I was thinking to myself.Your explanation makes the most sense to me."
17-1-1-1-1-1-5,"> “Maybe this time, Thomas ruled based on the actual LAW,” I was thinking to myself.Yeah I instantly disposed of that notion. Next I wondered what his angle really was. I fully expected him to rule for trump. My thought is nastier: He probably quietly reached out to trump, trump offered him nothing, expected Thomas to just rubber stamp his nonsense, so Thomas said “no deal” and here we are.Yes. Because of his past behavior and choices, I actually think Clarence Thomas is that selfish and evil and self-serving."
17-1-1-1-1-4,This is exactly what I was thinking when I seen the ruling.
17-1-1-1-1-5,The SC folks don't need Trump anymore.  They already got their lifetime appointment.  Better to get rid of him before he can do more weird shit.
17-1-1-1-2,If Alito and Thomas won’t even speak up then he is in some seriously deep shit now.
17-1-1-1-2-1,wouldn't this just be sacrificing the queen to get the checkmate?  they still got moore v harper to ruin
17-1-1-1-2-1-1,"Well, yes, they clearly don’t need him anymore. They’re thinking bigger picture now that they yield uncheckable power, and Moore v Harper is just the beginning. It’s step one of many towards their vision. It’s preheating the oven, and we haven’t even begun to cook."
17-1-1-1-2-1-1-1,"Using Trump’s populism to pack the courts and then dump him was always the obvious plan, it just surprised me that Trump couldn’t see it. Or maybe he could but his ego makes him think he can still overcome the entire Supreme Court, Senate, government, America…turns out the deep state was literally the entirety of life on this planet except for The Former Guy."
17-1-1-1-2-1-2,"Exactly. If they had dropped it for Trump it very may well have gotten us to flood the streets and make it harder for them to deal with Moore v: Harper and maybe we really jam up the works and demand we don’t answer to the SC anymore. It’ll take a flash point to set off like BLM was a picnic and l think letting trump go could  be just such fuel.They give us trump for a while to make us think something his finally happening they then they quietly disenfranchise us and too many people don’t Even understand what’s happening, we get crushed by the sabotages and the new “rulers” let trump off. I hate this but I just really see this move and I’m probably close to the truth."
17-1-1-1-2-3,"There's absolutely no reason for any of the sitting justices to support Trump in this matter. His arguments are obviously bunk legally, and the conservative majority doesn't want the Court's legitimacy to tank anymore — many of us here would argue it's far too late for that, but that's sort of the point; the cases that have so far tanked public faith in the Court have advanced a conservative agenda, whereas here they're being asked to throw a lifeline to a patsy who already delivered them the majority of the Court."
17-1-1-1-3,Curious as to how r/conservative folks are handling this. This ruling essentially means Trump can't delay or obstruct their usage in a criminal investigation against him. Meaning they can now freely charge him with a crime for taking and having them after a subpoena asked for them back. Given this happened right after the Alex Jones ruling I'm sure they are having a meltdown.
17-1-1-1-3-1,"No curiosity needed. They spin, lie, move goalposts, deny reality. Who cares about r/conservative ? Their voices are farts in the wind"
17-1-1-1-3-1-1,Or pretend it doesn't exist and ignore it like usually. This can be said about r/conservative itself or what they even talk about it.

17-1-1-1-3-2-4,"Boom, face."
17-1-1-1-3-3,"It’s like a different world over there…They have the article up and pretty much are saying that the j6 panel is 100% partisan and that it is seeking legitimacy by wanting trump to testify. Also there is the usual shit talking about how trump should not show up and also tell the committee to fuck off.And there is the usual denunciation of the left by saying we have a “victim complex”.I am kind of aghast. Because there is no serious belief that anything bad happened on j6 and why is trump being hounded about it.So as usual, 100% content free and nothing to see here…Why am I not surprised…PS A caveat to this is the article on the SCOTUS ruling…. There is confusion about it and people asking what it means…. ;)I so want to post; “ it means Trump is fucked”. But I don’t want to get banned.. Last time I posted over there I got a 3 day ban…."
17-1-1-1-3-3-3,"It's sad that they still think Trump is going to come in swinging for them. Trump has never engaged with their kind, except to rally votes. He could not care less about the little people."
17-1-1-1-3-4,">Curious as to how /r/conservative folks are handling thisThe usual denial and ""What about gas/the borders??"" whataboutism, I'm guessing."
17-1-1-1-3-4-1,"Yep. Same as usual.""But, Hunter Biden's laptop!""""But, Hillary's emails!""A bunch of deflection and false equivocation is the best these dweebs can ever seem to come up with. As you say, they're still whinging about """"""""""""Biden's"""""""""""" gas prices when OPEC literally *just* made international headlines by flat out admitting they're cutting production quotas to deliberately raise global oil prices."
17-1-1-2,"Yeah, this is absolutely a sign that the conservative movement is abandoning him. Best news I've heard all year."
17-1-1-2-2,He’s served his purpose…ripped of the veil of fascism and enabled a Christo-fascist court Job done
17-1-1-2-2-1,"Plus, his boy Ron DeathSentence is far more competent and doesn't even shit his pants (regularly). Best of all, he has all the cruelty and then some, without all the flagrant Jew-hating. There will be plenty of self-dealing to go around with Ronnie boy, trump is worthless now."
17-1-1-2-2-1-2,">Plus, his boy Ron DeathSentence is far more competentI disagree. It's Florida."
17-1-1-2-3,Eh they always were. Trump is a threat but I've been saying to friends since the start the one to fear is not him but the one who comes next. Mitch and the SCOTUS were never going to die on Trump Mountain...once his usefulness as an agent of chaos is over they're gonna toss him. The hope we have is it will backfire and fracture what remains of the GOP even further.
17-1-1-2-4,"Not really, he just had a garbage case. Even the heavy partisans had no reasonable argument to support him."
17-1-1-2-4-1,"Lol, when has lack of evidence and a garbage case stopped this SCOTUS from ruling however the hell they want? This is them putting into concrete writing that Trump is no longer on the team."
17-1-1-2-4-1-1,"> Lol, when has lack of evidence and a garbage case stopped this SCOTUS from ruling however the hell they want?Always? I mean we're not going to agree on this so I'm not going to bother. I don't agree with every Supreme Court opinion, but all of them have sound legal arguments. There is no possible way they could have found for Trump in this case. This was inevitable."
17-1-1-2-4-1-1-3,"Yeah, no. The current SC has demonstrated how little it cares about precedent or the letter of the law. Believing they'll act in good faith or even within the bounds of legality is a mistake."
17-1-1-2-5,The majority of Republicans still support him though
17-1-1-3,"None of them care about Trump. In fact, they’re all probably disgusted by him. Supreme Court justices are much more concerned about their own legacy. And Trump is just a liability when it comes to that."
17-1-1-3-1,"Yup, Trump played his part, got them in their seats for a solid majority. They don’t need him anymore"
17-1-1-5,They don’t care about him. He was a ticket to power. All of his bargaining chips are gone. And no one likes working with him.NSFW explanation? Trump was a condom the Republican party used to fuck the rest of us. And now that they’ve gotten what they wanted? They’re happy to throw him in the trash
17-1-2,"That’s not surprising. Even the justices furthest to the authoritarian, theocratic right are no big fans of Donald Trump. They will not bail him out personally. That’s not what they’re in it for. They are in it to establish their Christian nationalist ideology in law. The Federalist Society, with Trump as their “useful idiot,” put them there to do that, and they will do it, gladly; they have no personal fealty to Trump, and will not protect him. They are probably happy to watch him self-immolate."
17-1-2-5,"I would hope it's even more than that - if they truly view themselves as ""Patriots"", shouldn't the thought of Trump illegally removing classified documents and likely providing them to other governments in exchange for money/favors/influence absolutely disgust them?"
17-1-4,“but my judges” also “why people are so mean” djt 2022
17-2,And this day is just getting better and better....
17-2-1,What was the other part? I'm here for some good news...
17-2-1-1,The 1/6 Committee voted to subpoena Trump under oath to testify on the Insurrection.
17-2-1-1-1,And Treasury is investigating Desantis for misuse of funds!
17-2-1-1-1-1,And the migrants he bussed out of there get to apply for a special visa because they're victims of a crime... Caused by DeSantis. He's having a no good very bad day.
17-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Hadn't heard about that, god damn I am not sick of winning!"
17-2-1-1-1-1-1-3,Just came out [a couple hours ago!] The cherry on top is that this didn't come down from the White House - It's a Sheriff in San Antonio. *Chef's kiss.*
17-2-1-1-1-1-3,He should probably move to Australia.
17-2-1-1-1-1-5,"Keep going, I'm almost there"
17-2-1-1-1-1-5-1,Tomorrow is Friday
17-2-1-1-1-4,Trump getting subpoenaed and Desantis' getting investigated is definitely a good thing justice wise and I'm glad to see this happening to them but I wouldn't call these things good news. I take no joy in the fact that a former president failed at a violent coup to try to stay in power and that a governor committed such disgusting acts against migrants just for a political stunt. I wish these things never happened.
17-2-1-1-2,Fucking lol. That's just delicious. Tiny hands is getting on a plane and never coming back. And if that happens it's the perfect ending to the coward's journey that he's been on his whole life.
17-2-2,What a pleasant surprise this is.
17-2-2-1,I gave it 80/20 they would do just this...
17-3,I'm pleasantly relieved that the court did the right thing here.  The legal arguments from trump's team were absolutely garbage and they should be sanctioned for bringing them.
17-3-4,"Now we need to be ready for whatever bullshit trump is going to fling at the country, my question is how far will he go to incite violence?"
17-4,Holy shit what a loser. Even his own hand picked supreme court hands him an L.This guy loses on a whole other level. Dudes just built different.
17-4-1,Nobody loses like Trump… some say he’s the best biggest loser of them all.Edit: spelling
17-4-1-1,Many people are saying it.
17-4-1-2,"It's said that he's such a yuuuuge loser that 80 million people said ""You're fired!"""
17-5,"January 6 should bring Trump down. But the Mar-Lago records case definitely will.       “Fresh details about the politically charged Justice      Department inquiry … revealed a Trump employee      told federal investigators that Trump himself      ordered the moving of boxes stocked with records     following a May subpoena for classified material,      and security footage corroborated the account.”Consciousness of Guilt for criminal indictment."
17-5-1,"That isn’t even required. The documents were at his house when they shouldn’t have been, end of story. No motive is required."
17-5-1-1,"Yup, the possession is the crime. He's absolutely dead to rights.I wouldn't be surprised if he was on a plane right now headed for Minsk. It's over in terms of legal solutions for him."
17-5-1-1-2,Hope he has enough money left to get a bottle of advil for the wrist slapping he’ll receive for trying to blackmail the DOJ.
17-5-1-2,"It's like possession of methamphetamine, the thing itself (classified documents) are illegal to possess in the context the defendant was possessing it."
17-5-1-2-1,"So like drug offenses, we can charge based on the weight of the ""paraphernalia"" associated with the possession of the documents?  Can we weigh the weight of all the boxes, filing cabinets, and Mar-a-Lago itself, including the foundation and water in the pool?"
17-5-1-2-1-1,"It's 10 years per document, times hundreds of documents. Any fair trial puts him behind bars long past the end of his dishonest days on Earth."
17-5-2,"It’s a much easier case, IMO. Like Al Capone and his tax evasion."
17-5-2-1,"Which only gets easier when you realize that Al Capone was imprisoned before the passing of the RICO Act.One of the biggest problems is that nobody actually wants to pull the trigger on a RICO investigation without knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that this will lead to a guilty verdict (mostly because the right wing expects this and will harp on about any form of RICO investigation into the Republican party as a politicized attack rather than a genuine investigation).It is my opinion that this move demonstrates that the Department of Justice believes that they have enough evidence against one of the most litigious individuals in American history to prove criminal activity beyond a shadow of a doubt.This is not to say that Trump will immediately face a RICO investigation, but I don't think they wanted to move forward without a plan to take down the apparatus that used to be called the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" back in the 90s."
17-5-2-1-1,"Its because for RICO, traditionally the burden of evidence is so goddamn high that you would need many months to collect enough to execute. Trumps bitchass will be a candidate again before they collect enough for this. Luckily the current case wont have as high of a burden of proof its just a matter of whether anything will happen or not."
17-5-2-1-1-1,Many months would be lightning fast for a RICO case. It can take years for prosecutors to put one together.
17-5-2-1-1-1-1,"Exactly even my dumbass undersold it, RICO would go on for a very long time and while it would be nice to delete this Cabal all at once, I dont see it being possible unfortunately"
17-5-2-3,"Easier, but way less satisfying.I just don’t want a situation where the average American recollection of trump is that he was the moron who hoarded classified docs. For the health and future of the country, he *needs* to be remembered as a dangerous lunatic who quite nearly toppled American democracy."
17-5-2-3-1,"I dunno, watching someone as anti-intellectual as he portrays himself to be getting taken down by the librarians is pretty damn satisfying. Plus, if you can get him for this and NY destroys Trump International, suddenly he's going to lose the resources to fight off everything else bearing down on him and we can finally unravel the rest of this chapter of corruption."
17-5-4,"Jan 6 committee just subpoenaed trump to come before them, btw."
17-5-4-1,TFG’s having a really bad day. Fills me with joy.
17-5-4-1-1,What is TFG?
17-5-4-1-2,I really hope he's convicted. I suppose we could also get unlucky and the stress of all these legal battles could give him a heart attack.Fingers crossed.

18-1-1-1-2,MTG getting in trouble for campagne finance violations?
18-1-1-1-2-1,It’s only campagne if it’s from a specific region in France
18-1-1-1-2-1-1,Otherwise it's just a sparkling grift.
18-1-1-2,Bannon will appeal for years and Trump will ignore the subpoena.
18-1-1-2-1,"Probably true, but I'm still happy it happened."
18-1-1-2-1-1,Nothing has happened until Trump faces consequences.
18-1-1-4,Yeah and he appealed it and gets to walk free until his appeal is over. Hardly a win.
18-1-1-4-1,Be nice if he would step into a hole and disappear.
18-1-1-4-2,Would you rather an extra-judicial ruling and do away with due process?
18-1-1-4-2-1,"Due process? It’s pretty uncommon for someone to be found guilty of a crime, sentenced, then allowed to go home because “maybe he wins his appeal’? Especially when the case is so cut and dry. Here’s the case: Were you subpoenaed by congress? Yes. Did you show up? No. Guilty. What is there to appeal? His claims of executive privilege doesn’t work. He hasn’t been a member of the executive after 2017 and the subject of his testimony centers around events that took place over 3 years removed from his privilege claims. There’s no ambiguity, there’s no gray area, and there’s no logical reason for him to be given the benefit of the doubt. Lock his treasonous ass up!"
18-1-1-4-2-1-1,I agree.  I’m taking issue with people who insinuate that Bannon somehow “won” this whole affair because the legal system functioned normally.
18-1-1-4-2-1-2,Trump did nothing wrong! They haven't found anything on him in 7 years. Why do you think they have something now?? Because the fake committee said so...Lmao...Come on Midterms!! Red wave is coming!!
18-1-1-4-3,"There are more charges coming though from NY, so take heart in that."
18-1-1-5,"Bannon hasn't set foot in jail yet, and may never set foot in jail, and Trump's never going to give documents or testimony."
18-1-1-5-1,Law is optional for rich.
18-1-2,Can’t wait for the “Trump misses deadline” articles on November 15
18-1-2-1,"~~I don't think it will even get that far since some members of the January 6th committee will no longer be members of congress after midterms.~~edit from Politico: The select committee subpoenaed the former president on Friday, a historic — if largely symbolic — step that is unlikely to compel Trump’s testimony before the panel dissolves at the end of the year.edit:The committee, which voted unanimously on the move, is demanding Trump’s testimony **under oath**"
18-1-2-1-1,I wish I was born into privlegde and just ignore the law whenever I want and never face any consequences.
18-1-2-1-1-1,Get a rich dad.
18-1-2-1-1-2,"Would you still wish that, if it meant being someone like Trump?"
18-1-2-1-1-2-1,"Trust me, Trump thinks he's living the best life possible, even at the expense of others and constantly lying. To him, *that is the way it is done.*"
18-1-2-1-2,Don’t they have until January 3rd as their final day?
18-1-2-1-2-1,"So all Trump has to do is run out the clock.Committing more crimes every step of the way. Contempt, failure to appear, doesn't matter."
18-1-2-1-2-1-1,He can't run out the clock in this situation as the DOJ will actually enforce the will of Congress.
18-1-2-1-2-2,It seems like a shutdown of the committee/subpoena would appear like a coverup. The Durham and Mueller investigations weren’t stopped.
18-1-2-1-2-2-3,> Mueller investigations weren’t stoppedlmfao
18-1-2-1-3,"Congress doesn't switch hands until January, so they might refer it. Very unlikely the DOJ acts on it though."
18-1-2-3,Will he take a page out of the Alex Jones’ book on ignoring the court orders and getting royally fucked?
18-1-2-3-1,First part: yes. Second part: no.
18-1-3,Oh boy! I can’t wait to see trump’s apoplectic meltdown on his Store Brand Twitter
18-1-4,"Ugh.  Republicans take over the House, immediately end the commission and begin impeachment of Biden.  Trust me."
18-1-4-2,"Still gotta figure out what they’re going to impeach him for. They’ll be in the House halfway through the vote with every R voting Yay, when someone finally says “wait what are we charging him with?” and you’ll see 200+ R’s look around the room naming the things they see and scramble together “Uhhh chairs.. no.. doors! Yea! He uhhhh he betrayed the senate door rules! Biden hates doors and america!”"
18-1-4-2-1,"Hiding his son’s laptop, being a fascist…They don’t need real reasons-it’s all spectacle. Especially if they don’t have the Senate."
18-1-4-2-1-1,"Plus, impeaching for bullshit reasons will make Trump's previous impeachments seem frivolous as well.  ""He got two, Biden gets three.""  It's another way of proving government is inept by your own ineptitude."
18-1-4-2-1-1-1,"""See?! Impeachement is just a PaRtIsAn IsSuE! Just like Republicans didn't indict Trump, Democrats didn't indict Biden! I'm an enlightened centrist with a brain the size of a walnut and I can't understand context!"""

18-2-1,"Worse yet, we could end up with Trump as our president and MTG as VP in 2024.  That outcome will be significantly more likely if Republicans take congress during these midterms."
18-2-1-2,"I have so much anxiety about the consequences of this upcoming election (as a person with a uterus, especially) but at the same time I feel silly because the consequences/things that Republicans have literally stated they plan to do are so extreme that surely I'm just overreacting and the Republicans would never actually do _that_..... Right?"
18-2-1-2-2,They overturned Roe. I was told my entire life that they would never dare do that.
18-2-1-2-2-1,"i've also been told that there's always been a peaceful transition of power in the united states.with trumpian GQP, all bets are off.  vote for the sane people, please."

18-2-5-2,"Don’t be too sure. Many people who haven’t voted before have been so shocked by the insurrection and Roe v Wade being struck down that turnout at the polls expects to be the highest ever. And that could very well impact elections on a state level — for Governor and Senator. Many red state Governors and Senators are not as safe as they once were as these people who weren’t voting before now have a reason to. And while Representatives in tiny red districts will probably not feel the pinch, statewide elections in red states are looking to be a totally different affair this cycle."
18-2-5-5,"Incorrect. If every voter had that mentality, sure, but if no one did, your deep red state would suddenly be a lot more purple.I vote blue in an overwhelmingly blue state. That doesn’t mean my vote doesn’t count. It means it’s part of the general consensus."
18-3,If Bill Clinton can be subpoenaed for sexual transgressions this fucking toad can answer for his lack of action on that seriously tragic day.

18-3-1-1,"It's shocking how few people know that not only did he not call in the DC national guard, on January 4th he had banned them from deploying except for a 50 man team in Maryland.  That team was banned from carrying weapons, body armor, riot control or even interacting with protestors except to prevent immediate harm to someoneMemo from the secretary of defense"
18-3-1-2,"But they were the best actions, a lot of people are saying it."
18-3-1-3,"Oh yeah, absolutely."
18-3-1-4,"Huge, magnificent, powerful actions."
18-3-1-5,"Sure. But it’s hard to convince Trumples that. They’ll just deny he had anything to do with it. But if you tell them “if BC can get subpoenaed for something so insignificant and he shows up, what does that say about your guy? Why is he different?”Not that it’ll make any difference of course, they’ll just some spout some conspiracy nonsense… but it’s fun to watch them squirm around their own self-delusions to rationalize the irrational.You are definitely right."
18-3-5,"While I agree with you, I just have to set the record straight. Bill Clinton wasn't impeached for sexual transgressions. Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath and Obstruction of Justice."
18-3-5-1,"Oh, yes I'm aware of that. I wasn't talking about his impeachment.  The 'lie' came from when he answered the subpoena. But thank you!"
18-3-5-1-1,Why do you put 'lie' in quotes like it didn't happen?After concrete proof came out he admitted to it
18-3-5-1-1-1,To call attention to it. Not to suggest otherwise. Of course he lied.

18-4-2-3-1-2,"Hell I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians would use that boost to try to divide the US into Civil War. We're seeing it happening already, but with Trump defecting to the Russians and saying all of their ridiculous bullshit, it might divide America to the breaking point."

18-4-4-1-1,Didn't Bannon just get sent to prison for four months for disobeying his own subpoena from the same committee?
18-4-4-1-1-1,sentenced. He's appealing and doesn't have to serve until that plays out
18-5,"He’s either going to:Not show up, resulting maybe in a charge, but won’t end in prison time.orShow up and plead the fifth to every question."
18-5-1,"I’m so curious if he will plead the fifth. Every legal consult will be telling him to, but this is the man who had to get his phone taken away the night of his election to keep him off Twitter. Surely his ego will not allow him to sit there with that microphone in his face and say nothing."
18-5-1-1,"If not the Fifth, the other favorite response is ""I don't recall."""
18-5-2,"There's 0 chance he shows up. Everything republicans are saying about biden is true of trump, he's barely coherent now. No way his handlers will let him go in for hostile questioning on live TV."

20,Judge finds Trump in contempt in legal fight with NY AG
20-1,So what exactly happens when that $10k/day never gets paid?
20-1-1,Failure to pay your fine & mandatory surcharge may result in:* a warrant being issued for your arrest* suspension of your driver's license (if applicable)* a civil judgment being filed with the County Clerk
20-1-1-1,That's it! Suspend Trump's driver's license!!
20-1-1-1-1,Fun fact![Former presidents aren't allowed to drive.]
20-1-1-1-1-1,There are a lot of things that Trump isn't/wasn't supposed to do.  Hasn't stopped him yet.
20-1-1-1-1-1-1,Does he even know how to drive a non golf cart automobile? Serious question.
20-1-1-1-1-2,"He wasn’t supposed to use his phone either, or email, or take classified material… something tells me it doesn’t matter."
20-1-1-4,Or nothing LMAO. USA is spineless as fuck and so is every politician.
20-2,"NEW YORK (AP) — A New York judge found former President Donald Trump in contempt of court Monday for failing to adequately respond to a subpoena issued by the state’s attorney general as part of a civil investigation into his business dealings.Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to pay a fine of $10,000 per day.“Mr. Trump, I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously,” Engoron said before issuing the ruling from the bench in a Manhattan courtroom, following a hearing."
20-2-1,"sounds like trump supporters will be paying a $10,000 a fine"
20-2-1-1,Daily.EDIT: One word and 1700 upvotes?! I’d like to give a shout out to Rae Rae and Lil Steve! Third Eye C U! Jet fuel don’t melt steel!
20-2-1-1-1,Can Russia even afford this right now?
20-2-1-1-1-1,"Nah, my dad is probably picking up this one. :(Many of our dads probably are. :("
20-2-1-1-3,Fortunately for them they'll be deluded into thinking they're putting the money and time towards fighting Nazis or Peetoephiles.
20-2-1-1-3-1,"There are numerous Texan Trump supporters who would gladly send every paycheck they get to help Trump fight against ""communist liberal New York"" courts"
20-2-1-1-4,"He will be long dead before he pays a penny of that fine.Trump may be an idiot, but he's a genius in this one way: he has discovered that literally nothing in our social norms or justice system has any teeth behind it if you are in his position of questionable wealth and questionable power. You can do whatever the hell you want and ignore whoever the hell you want. He abuses that fact to the utmost of anyone I've ever seen. Kudos, you disgusting grifter."
20-2-1-1-5,That's such a TINY TINY number.  And he can (and likely will) just ignore it.
20-2-1-1-5-1,"I don’t know, Trump was the only greedy asshole to cash a check for under a dollar."
20-2-1-1-5-1-1,"That's money that's owed TO him.  Not money he owes.Remember, he stole from Kids with Cancer.  Greedy is an understatement!"
20-2-1-2,"At trumps estimated net worth of 2.5B, he could pay that daily for 684 years before he’s broke.The rich and powerful just laugh at our justice system while us common folks would be financially ruined or more likely, thrown in jail for contempt.Edit:  I fucking get it, it’s not liquid or made up or whatever.  Point is, this is meaningless to him until the cell door slams shut.  Not a privilege any normal people would get."
20-2-1-2-1,"The judge can impose ever increasing sanctions to compel compliance, up to and including being jailed until he complies. The judge is supposed to impose the least punitive sanction that is effective to enforce compliance, so they often start small and ratchet up the sanction."
20-2-1-2-1-2,The Governor of Florida has said he won’t extradite Trump to New York City no matter what so I doubt he’s worried about that
20-2-1-2-1-2-1,DeSantis doesn't get a say in this. The Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution is pretty unambiguous here.
20-2-1-2-1-2-1-2,Nothing is unambiguous to a bad actor
20-2-1-2-1-2-2,"[States \(and cities\) often spar like this] on a political level. I can see an escalation where New York stops travel and extradition to and from Florida. New York is New York however, it's the dominate state by way of New York City. If it comes to extradition, DJT will be trapped in Florida."
20-2-1-2-1-2-3,States cannot refuse extradition to other states.
20-2-1-2-2,His billionaire status has long been debunked. No one believes he has 2.5 billion or anywhere close to it.
20-2-1-2-2-1,"Still, say he has 1/5th of that.At $500M he only needs to make 0.7% interest/gains on that in order to pay his yearly fines."
20-2-1-2-3,"Except that's absolutely not his real net worth. The dude is almost certainly bankrupt, and this is going to hurt like hell. More importantly, it's step one on the path to jailing him."
20-2-1-2-3-1,"Also, Russia is a little strapped at the moment so unlikely to get help there."
20-2-1-2-3-1-1,"If he was truly strapped, he could just borrow a cool 10 mil from Jared."
20-2-1-2-3-1-1-1,"Jared and Ivanka are already making plans to throw Daddy Dearest under the bus. Ivanka was one of the first Trump admin officials to testify before the 1/6 Commission, without having to be compelled. She knows he's going to flip from an asset to a liability to her brand soon."
20-2-2,Trump might not be as wealthy as he says but I'm pretty sure he can afford $10k per day until he dies. Wake me up when he faces actual problems.
20-2-2-1,"That may be true, but also, he *famously* never pays for anything.  He doesn't pay the bill at restaurants, he doesn't pay the venues he rents for his rallies, he doesn't pay his lawyers ... what possible reason does anyone have to think he would ever pay these fines?"
20-2-2-1-1,The fines can be imposed and collected without his consent.They can freeze and withdraw his assets.
20-2-2-1-1-1,But they likely won't.
20-2-2-1-1-1-1,"And even if they do, how is that a punishment? He’s just paying to ignore true law at that point. Plus, he won’t be paying it - members of his cult will."
20-2-2-1-2,I guess the question is what happens if he just doesn't pay the fines. If he isn't arrested shortly thereafter than it's just more snores from me.
20-2-2-1-2-1,Well he's 'rich' so probably nothing compared to what would happen to us normal folk who forget to pay a 70$ traffic ticket
20-2-3,10k per day is pretty small even if DJT isn't actually a billionaire.  Should've taken the approach they took with Alex Jones and double the fine for each business day he is non-compliant. 10k may not mean a thing but it doesn't take long to get to pretty big numbers if he's noncompliant.
20-3,">I feel like there's an 800-pound gorilla in the room, and that is, why don't we have an affidavit from him? There is a difference between saying something and saying something under oath.FINALLY a judge with at least one functioning testicle."
20-3-1,">The contempt finding by the judge came despite a spirited argument by Habba, who insisted repeatedly that she went to great lengths to comply with the subpoena, **even traveling to Florida to ask Trump specifically** whether he had in his possession any documents that would be responsive to the demand.->Habba noted that **Trump does not send emails or text messages and has no work computer “at home or anywhere else.”** She described the search for documents as “diligent.”So it never crossed your mind, perhaps, to **get an affidavit from him when you met with him in person?**"
20-3-1-1,"The former leader of the free world doesn't communicate in written form, except by tweet..... Nice"
20-3-1-1-1,"Well, he's about to get unbanned."
20-3-1-1-1-1,Is this in reference to Elon or did I miss something else?
20-3-1-1-1-1-3,Pretty sure it's Elon.
20-3-1-1-3,I think the implication here is that he uses burner phones/email so his communication cannot be used against him in the future. kinda like a criminal organization would.
20-3-1-1-3-1,Exactly like a criminal organisation does.
20-3-2,There’s clear legal precedent to order jail time for someone found in contempt for a civil suit. She’s staying in her lane. My hope is because additional legal charges against Mr. Orange are pending.
20-3-2-1,"Between this case heating up, the investigation down in Georgia, and the 1/6 Commission getting ready to release its recommendations to the DoJ... man, I'd forgotten what hope felt like."
20-3-2-1-1,Think my hope was about this high when Mueller was about to release his report. Then I got quite deflated. Hoping this goes the other way
20-3-2-1-1-1,"The Mueller Report was honestly extremely damning of Trump, it just got massively spun in the other direction because Barr is a lackey and nothing more.It laid out numerous instances in which Trump had or may have obstructed justice."
20-3-2-1-1-1-1,"I still have to deal with the people who say that it was a total exoneration.  None of them bothered to read any portion of it, of course."
20-3-2-1-1-1-1-1,"When people say ""the Russia hoax"" just point them to the DOJ indictment against the Russian officials involved.  It spells out a good chunk of their activity in the US.  The Mueller report basically says that they couldn't prove nor disprove any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian actions like those in the indictment, but that is very far from a total exoneration."
20-3-2-1-1-1-1-5,"Same here.    I find myself explaining the report like this.    Part 1 says that Mueller couldn't tell if Trump was 1) an evil genius who insulated himself from  knowingly violating campaign finance laws, 2) was an idiot who didn't know he was surrounded by people who insulated him from knowingly violating campaign finance laws, or 3) was such an idiot that he hired a bunch of idiots who couldn't be bothered/didn't read any of the campaign finance laws, and thus couldn't knowingly violate them.    Part 2 say Mueller couldn't tell because Trump directly, deliberately, and repeatedly obstructed justice and impeded the investigation.    Basically, the Mueller report says there's a 66% chance Trump is an idiot who broke the law and a 33% chance Trump is an evil mastermind who also broke the law."
20-3-2-1-1-1-4,"Yeah this is what frustrates me about the whole thing. Mueller did exactly what he was supposed to, no more, no less when it came to writing his report. He absolutely could have been more aggressive in seeking information or compelling interviews, but he laid out a clear and concise case for more investigation and repercussions. He clearly documents 11 instances where Trump did or very likely did obstruct justice and the investigation. This he passed along the correct channels. He is a career bureaucrat and followed the system, but unfortunately thr system was cooped by wannabe fascists trying to prop up their guy.Then Barr got his grubby little authoritarian hands on it and utterly buried it while claiming it exonerated Trump entirely. Barr lied. He absolutely should have faced consequences foe that lie but frankly we've been in a state of constitutional crisis since Trump took office and the GOP bent over and spread them for him. And they're still doing it."
20-3-2-1-3,Right when Elon is about to buy Twitter and gain control of the site all news goes through.
20-3-2-1-3-1,Trump goes to jail for the rest of his life but the caveat is you can't mention it on Twitter?I'll take that deal 6 ways to Sunday.
20-3-2-1-3-1-2,Not to mention that will likely be the death of Twitter. I can’t imagine brands jumping onboard to support that shitshow of an advertisement platform IF that happens.
20-3-2-1-3-3,Twitter is not a news site.
20-3-2-1-3-3-1,Just because it's not supposed to be doesn't mean people don't get their news from there
20-3-2-1-3-3-1-2,People who get their news from Twitter aren't the kind of people looking for the truth. Its one step above Facebook as a source.
20-3-2-1-3-3-4,"Many news sites and other sources do post their news there, so it is a proxy for getting news out. You can't just dismiss it as not a news site because it doesn't follow traditional ways."
20-3-2-1-3-4,"Twitter is far and away one of the smallest social platforms, globally. Barely edging out reddit. We are on the fringe here. Facebook/Instagram/Meta products, and its main competitors overseas hold the overwhelming majority of the market share in users and throughput of data."
20-3-2-1-3-4-4,The only reason we hear so much about Twitter is because the people who report the news are on Twitter.
20-3-2-2,"Ha, as if the rich and powerful would ever see a cell.  10k a day is pocket change for billionaires."
20-3-2-2-1,"He is absolutely not a billionaire, despite the lies he tries to spin."
20-3-2-2-1-1,He might be by now considering how much he managed to profit from corruption during his presidency.
20-3-2-2-2,"Martha Stewart did, but she also committed the crime of having a uterus. And her prison was pretty cushy."
20-3-2-2-2-1,She did her time with grace and came out of it more popular than when she went in.
20-3-2-2-2-2,Her prison cell was in healthy living Magazines.Idolizing is the most fascinating and dumb fucking thing people do.
20-3-4,"That's unfair. He's 300lbs, maybe."
20-5,"What happens when the fine is just paid daily, but Trump refuses to comply otherwise? $10k daily is rather laughable for people with as much money as he has available. He could easily afford to go several years of paying this fine, especially if he just uses donations to fund it, and he will."
20-5-5,Except he doesn’t have the money. That’s the joke: his entire career has been a giant graft. How do you think he got so far into hawk with Russia?
20-5-5-3,Yeah he's a grafter
21,"Jan. 6 committee notifies DOJ that Trump tried tampering with one of its witnesses, Cheney says"
21-1,I bet he was dumb enough to call and leave a voicemail
21-1-2,"Yeah I'm wondering if that's how Liz can claim with certainty that he was ""tampering."" Otherwise he will just claim he was calling to ask for their risotto recipe or something."
21-1-2-1,"The man eats steak well-done with ketchup, I'd hate to see what he does to risotto."
21-1-2-1-1,Minute rice with Paul Newman Alfredo sauce.
21-1-2-1-1-1,"Hey man, don't knock Paul Newmans.  It donates it's profits to charity, Trump would refuse to buy it because of that alone.  And it's really good for the price."
21-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Trump is a Ragu man, I'd guess"
21-1-2-1-1-1-1-2,"I like ragu because poor, but if Trump eats it I'm going to a different brand."
21-1-3,Is it really dumb anymore? Clearly he has demonstrated that he is miles above the law and has a throng of useful idiots ready to dive under a bus for him without even a thank you. Just like Giuliani who will have “Lied for Trump” on his epitaph.
21-1-4,"I feel like some people already forgot about when he called one of the officials in Georgia after the election results. The recorded conversation was him outright asking for them to ""skim for more votes"" or try to find some in his favor. How that wasn't the end of him (alongside a million other toddler like behaviors) I will never understand."
21-2,Jesus can we please put him in prison already?
21-2-1,"After watching today, I want to know how the fuck Roger Stone and Flynn haven't been charged."
21-2-1-2,"They were, and were pardoned"
21-2-2,"Seriously, he's been playing felony bingo forever. He's gotten every number in the machine. If I was tasked to go out into the world and commit as many felonies as humanly possible and in the end, I'll get a blanket pardon for all of them, I still wouldn't come close to how many he's committed only if you count everything he's done since the night of the White House correspondents dinner in 2011, the one where Obama made a crack at his reality show and you can see him fake-laughing and ready to jump on the stage and murder him."
21-2-2-1,"You're not being fair to yourself. Did Trump commit more felonies casually disregarding the law than you ever could on your best day? Yes, he did. But look at the resources he's been working with. Huge name recognition, mob connections, a shared love of uncomfortable, women-based businesses with connected skeevy people worldwide, and that's before we even get to the Presidency.How can you be expected to put 2 U.S.C. § 611 on the scoreboard without any foreign governments interested in making you their agent? How are you gonna go down for witness tampering when nobody even knows who you are? You can't hold that against yourself.I believe in you! And if you need someone to leave his mailbox unlocked so you can interfere with his mail, you let me know."
21-2-2-2,I think the only crimes he hasn’t committed are direct manslaughter and murder crimes honestly
21-2-3,I hope trump announces his intent to run in 2024 soon. I'd love to see the GQP eat itself by nominating an indicted trump as its candidate.
21-2-5,"No. He could rape a baby and murder a black man with a machete in the street and nothing would happen. If it hasn’t happened by now with all the other stuff, it isn’t going to."
21-3,"A message to those who have been deposed: If Trump calls you, activate a recording device, and pick up the call. Do the right thing."
21-3-1,"Don’t give the recording to the J6 committee, don’t give it to the police, don’t give it to the DOJ, send it to every news outlet and then post it to all of your social medias."
21-3-1-1,"Yeah, imagine they broadcast something like ""They just let you grab their pussy when you're that famous"" and it was played all over the news. That would demolish his chances."
21-3-1-1-1,That's the craziest thing about all of this.  Conservative voters just don't give a fuck.  They want Donald Trump as their king.... I guess they call it 'Ruler' now.
21-3-1-1-1-2,"They did polls on this. Conservatives who under Obama were overwhelmingly critical of what they deemed ""immoral behavior"" in a president changed their opinions by like 80% when Trump was elected."
21-3-1-1-2,It would be devastating if a tape leaked of Trump mocking a disabled person.
21-3-1-1-2-1,Or POWs.
21-3-1-1-2-1-1,Or barging into a room full of naked teenagers
21-3-1-1-2-1-1-1,Or if he had close connections with a known pedophile and sex trafficker.
21-4,The next hearing is in a week and a half. Be there. Will be wild!
21-4-1,">Be there. Will be wild!“If it’s what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer!”"
21-4-1-3,Less than a Mooch away!
21-4-4,"DOJ, stand down and stand by."
21-4-4-2,No... turn in... Take notes... And for the love of God.... Country I mean... Do your job and LOCK HIM UP!
21-4-5,"we'll get to know everything he's done and watch him get away with it! just like the mueller report, the impeachment and everything else"
21-5,"Don't forget that [Trump obstructed justice up to 10 times, according to the Mueller report].  Trump also called [Raffensberger to find 11,780 votes in Georgia].Trump witness tampering, obstructing justice, and asking people to violate federal law, is just another day at the office for him."
21-5-1,"Agree - the Raffensberger conversation by itself should've led to impeachment and indictment. Straight-up anti-democratic corruption, recorded and witnessed! Not to mention the ""perfect"" conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine, also recorded. But that's not the kind of country we live in, at the moment."
21-5-1-1,"Holy crap, that phone call to Georgia. Just… the audacity."
21-5-1-1-1,"Trump says on that call:   You say my vote count is x.    I believe my vote count is y.   I want you to record my vote count as z.         ""z"" is a number Trump knows to be false, making that call a crime on a silver platter.       Very few criminals are so stupid as to gift wrap all three elements of fraud so elegantly in a single recording like that."
21-5-2,"Isn't that wild? The Mueller report specifically mentioned 10 occasions Trump had obstructed the investigation of justice, each on itself a crime, and a complicit AG in Barr sat on the report and said it was nothing. Claimed it exonerated Trump entirely. And when it finally came to light just how much Trump had broken the law, Trump's fans didn't read it so they accepted Barr's assertion it was nothing. And so Trump remained free, because his own appointed AG, appointed solely to quash the Mueller investigation, did his job.Barr obstructed justice (again) and should be in jail, don't mistake that. And Mueller did his job and made his recommendations to Congress that Trump should be indicted, but he followed the norm and followed the legal niceties and so the whole thing was smothered, so Trump was free to try and overthrow his own government.Tldr? Trump is a criminal who should have been behind bars long before Jan 6th."
21-5-3,"Yeah, well, Bill Barr is no longer leading the DOJ and people are being subpoenaed left and right in Georgia. Liz Cheney means business. I wouldn't just gloss over this development."
21-5-3-1,>Liz Cheney means business. It seems like Liz Cheney is the only republican left that actually holds true to the values they claim to hold dear.ETA: THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU IN MY REPLIES WHO COMPLETELY MISSED THE POINT OF MY COMMENT AND FELT THE NEED TO POINT OUT THAT LIZ CHENEY ISN'T ACTING WITH PURE INTENTIONS. A CHENEY BEING A DISINGENUOUS POLITICIAN ISN'T BRAND NEW INFORMATION.
21-5-3-1-1,"I likely won't ever agree with any of Liz Cheney's political views, but I applaud the work she's doing with this committee. Even though I consider myself heavily left leaning, I wish I could praise more Republicans in this manner."
21-5-3-1-1-1,"Adam Kinzinger, also."
21-5-3-1-1-1-1,"Yeah,  I'm pretty sure Adam Kinzinger and I disagree on a lot of policy issues,  but you know what?  He's the kinda guy it appears you could have a reasonable conversation about it with."
21-5-3-1-1-1-1-1,"I miss reasonable conversations with conservatives more than I ever would have thought possible before 2016. Like, I actually miss them. Come back. Let’s work together to make things better for our children, for flying fucking sakes."
21-5-3-1-1-2,"Don't be tricked into not voting if it turns into Cheney/Romney/Kinzinger vs. Biden. Even though there's not a huge difference between them, giving up the presidency to the GOP now just lets them appoint more judgest and codify removal of rights."
21-5-3-1-1-2-1,I wouldn't vote for them (and don't live in any of their districts to vote for or against them for Congress). I'm just glad that there are still a few Republicans who recognize our democracy. It's sad that the bar is that low.
21-5-3-1-1-4,"That’s what politics is supposed to be about. We can disagree on policy, but respect and admire someone’s integrity"
21-5-3-1-4,"I never thought I'd be cheering on a Cheney, but here we are in Bizarro world"
21-5-3-1-5,"We now live in a world where a Cheney is a moderate.  A fucking Cheney. All it takes is not trying to overthrow the government and boom, people respect you."
21-5-3-3,"I'm glossing over this entire fucking circus until I see Trump in jail or taking what traitors normally take in capital offenses. Until that day, none of this bullshit matters."
21-5-5,">Trump witness tampering, obstructing justice, and asking people to violate federal law, is just another day at the office for him.I guarantee he has no idea what he did was a crime because he's done it 100 times before and never been punished for it. I go 45 in a 35 zone every single day on my way to the office. Donald Trump thinks of felonies the exact same way."
21-5-5-1,"Well that's the sick part of this.  Society has some sort of idea that crimes are only committed when they are tried to be covered up.  Many people feel that things that happen out in broad public, without shame, must not be illegal right?  The funny thing is that trump saying he could go to 5th ave and shoot someone and still have people's support seems more true because he does his crimes in public.  Because he's convinced everyone that it is socially acceptable to do these things."
21-5-5-1-1,"Trump always tries to cover it up, he's just terrible at it, and legally had no right to do so as President, especially when Congress is the one knocking. His supporters keep swearing that nothing happened.Then he does a 180, tells people what happened and that it wasn't a big deal. Then they say it happened - and do so without a hint of irony - but that we are blowing it out of proportion.In the minds of his followers, nothing sticks to this dude. He's had a lot of legal losses, but nothing overly real. It's time to give him something real."
21-5-5-2,"Nah, he definitely knows it's a crime, he just doesn't care."
21-5-5-2-1,"Its exactly like the point the op was trying to make and missed a crucial part. They know what they're doing is illegal, they just don't care bc so far there have been no consequences."
21-5-5-2-1-1,"I'd go further.  They both know it's illegal, but I'd wager Trump doesn't see what he's doing as wrong specifically because it's him doing it.  OP may or may not think going 45 in a 35 is wrong. But I'd bet they would consider anyone else doing it to be *equally as right/wrong*. Trump thinks it's right for him to do it, but would be apoplectic if someone else tried what he was doing."
21-5-5-2-1-1-1,He's a sociopath. I don't think the concept of wrong really exists in his mind or heart unless it involves him personally being damaged.
21-5-5-2-2,"Donald also has long had the mindset (and extremely demented view) that everyone is corrupt and cheats, and that he just has to beat them all to the punch to get the biggest rewards."

22-1,">A U.S. judge has thrown out former President Trump's lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, saying the former president ""is seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.""> ""And this Court is not the appropriate forum,"" Judge Donald Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida wrote.This seems pretty cut and dry."
22-1-1,Imagine how long it took some lawyer to create that two hundred page document.  And then imagine how much they're not getting paid for it when Trump stiffs them.
22-1-1-1,"Never mind just making a 200 page document, but trying to translate 45’s ramblings *into* a 200 page document *in legalese.* I’m pretty sure that qualifies as torture"
22-1-1-1-2,Giuliani would be my bet to write that
22-1-1-1-2-1,"Pretty sure he stiffed Giuliani his legal fees once, I'd say he's not dumb enough to help trump again but with these chucklefucks who knows"

22-1-1-1-2-1-5,"He's either too crazy or in too deep to bail on the trump train now. Anyone who supported him post election either has to step away in shame and disgrace for doing so, or dig in even deeper on the bet that he gets back into power so they come out as heroes. There's really no in between that I can think of"
22-1-1-1-2-4,"And then when the courts won't listen he'll read it, in full, in an alley behind a porn shop"
22-1-1-2,If Trump wrote it it would just be rambling fanfiction about himself and vague insults at everyone he doesn't like.
22-1-1-3,45 minutes on the toilet at 3am. That's how long it would take me (not a lawyer) to produce something of an equivalent quality.
22-1-1-3-2,"It takes you 45 minutes to have a shit? Metamucil, my friend."
22-1-1-4,I suppose it depends upon the how much of it was taken verbatim from Trump's ranting...
22-1-2,This is 100% on brand for trump and those like him. A complete lack of understanding that the government doesn't work like television. You can't just start yelling and expect the legal system to fall in line with the narrativeReminds me of watching Alex Jones try to start ranting on the stand when he was being asked yes or no questions under oath
22-1-2-1,"The thing is, Trump has had a fair amount of success using this tactic - perhaps all of his success.Relentless, non stop pushing, in public, is highly effective."
22-1-2-2,Yep. These people are just determined to torture a captive audience and pound their rhetoric into their heads until their ears bleed..... its nice to see more and more of us have had quite enough of this bullshit......
22-1-3,"Fun fact:Former presidents of the United States are still called by their titles. Ex. President Obama and President Bush. Trump is the only President who is referred to as ""former President Trump""."
22-1-3-1,"Bush and Obama aren't walking around in front of cameras, claiming to still be president, with that absurd claim being echoed by thousands of social media followers and TV fans. ""President Obama"" understands that he's a former president and recognizes the courtesy. ""President Trump"" does not."
22-1-3-1-1,Also the only former President selling the nations secrets.
22-1-3-2,"I like ""ex-president"" better. Chris Hayes on MSNBC using that term almost exclusively."
22-1-3-2-1,Twice Impeached President Trump
22-1-3-2-1-1,Never won the popular vote loser trump
22-1-3-2-2,Presidential loser Trump
22-1-3-4,Another subtle sign that American society hasn't learned yet that elected officials aren't more than public servants.
22-1-3-4-1,"It's a respect thing due to the high pressure and scrutiny of the job. **most** former presidents don't declare they are still the president after their term of office is over, though."
22-1-3-4-1-1,"**Most** presidents recognize that the presidency is a job, a duty, a service to the nation. I'm pretty sure even GW understood that. But Trump seemed to view the presidency as a toy to play with, a prize that he gets to use for his personal benefit."

22-3-1-1,"> And to make it appear that there is some deep state plot against him.The deep state conspiracy being the [US Code of criminal law]; the [Civil Laws and Codes of the State of New York]; and very specifically [Georgia Code Title 16, Chapter 14]"
22-3-1-1-1,"It's not the deep state.  It's the very fucking shallow state.  This guy is about 1/8"" deep."
22-3-1-1-1-4,I think it's important to point-out the fascistic foundations of the 'deep state' narrative.  There's a reason Trump and Tucker Carlson and all their sycophants love to talk about 'The Deep State' and 'The Liberal Elites' and 'The LGBT Mafia'.  They rarely ever name names beyond the handful of Clinton/Soros-like figures they use to personify and further vilify these imagined groups.It's intentionally obtuse and vague so that they and their sheep-brained voters can apply these labels to anyone who disagrees with them about anything.  It's what allows them to pretend to be victims while they victimize the rest of the world around them.  It's exactly the same as how cults insulate their members from the outside world by making it seem too scary to leave.
22-3-1-4,He's so corrupt he'd drown in a puddle.
22-3-1-4-1,And his kids would probably want to bottle the water and sell it to his fans.
22-3-2,"The *leader of the Republican Party* stole and mishandled thousands of government documents, many with classified information. He’s a traitor, and so is everyone in his Party that is enabling him."
22-3-2-1,"According to some conspiracy conservative radios I've been forced to hear recently (coworkers blast it while they work) the fact that Trump stole a ton of secret and top secret documents is all smokescreen to distract the public from *drumroll please* Hunter Biden's laptop. Every time you think surely this will be the bottom line for the Republican Party, they whip out a shovel to start digging in deeper."
22-3-2-1-1,"The latest one I heard was that the top secret documents are related to the ""deep state conspiracy"" against him so he had to keep them because Biden and the democrats can't be trusted, so he needs them to exact his righteous justice on the conspirators or something.This line of thought is of course ridiculous but also careless and dangerous, as there are apparently very real people who are assets or operatives for the US government that are identified in some of these documents who may have now been compromised and are in very real danger. And on top of that, if they are able to escape the immediate danger and enter the US, they could face harassment, threats, and real harm by Trump supporters who will consider them ""deep state"" enemies who dared oppose their God Emperor, despite being collateral damage in a cynical effort to protect a man's fragile ego and shield him from accountability for his crimes."
22-3-2-1-1-2,"I work for an agency where we have just Secret stuff om the premises.It's kept inside a very tough steel safe.  Only a handful of people have the combination, regardless of their clearance.  Everytime It's opened, it has to be logged.The safe is inside an alarmed,  solid steel literal vault.  Only a handful of people are allowed in.  Even fewer have the combination. Every time it's opened, it's logged.That's for Secret.Trump had Top Secret / SCI in loose cartons in a shed wirh a bike lock on it.  And he had to be told to put the bike lock on it."
22-3-2-1-1-2-1,"It's wild! And even beyond the cartoonishly inept ""secure storage,"" Mar-a-Lago itself is far from a fortress, it's a resort. A very not secure resort. US intelligence was sounding alarm bells before, during, and after Trump's presidency about a huge number of security concerns there. [This is a story from 2017]. Known spies have been seen there. US cybersecurity teams have warned that its network is easily hackable. It's effectively a foreign spy's playground."
22-3-2-1-1-3,"The conspiracy shit some Germans shouted about Jews almost a century ago was equally ludicrous yet resulted eventually in the very real and brutal deaths of millions.The Republicans I fear even more than Xi's fascist dystopia or Putin's expansionist dictatorship.

So not only would he be guilty of mishandling classified information, so would whoever obtained them for him would be too lolIt's all so stupid, and the fact that people come up with these fucking insane excuses for Trump is just obnoxious."
22-3-2-2,It’s called “owing the libs” how have you not caught onto this yet? If you label anything “owning the libs” people will wholeheartedly support it. Trump is amazing at “owning the libs” and that’s why he has so many worshippers.
22-3-2-2-1,There's no small irony that the overwhelming majority of people trying to own the libs don't have enough intellectual currency to even rent a lib.
22-3-2-2-1-1,Can’t get that at Aarons
22-3-2-2-1-1-1,Probably can't even get a payday loan.
22-3-2-2-2,"He has so many followers because for them, Trump legitimized their hate of people who aren’t them."
22-3-2-2-3,We should throw Trump in Jail to own the libs!! That would show them!
22-3-2-2-4,"I’ve been watching what the Republican Party has been doing to the country for over 40 years, I’m fully aware of their psychology. My point is that this is not an isolated act by a single Republican; the Party itself is involved and committing treason."
22-3-2-3,"OK, but what about *her emails*?"
22-3-3,"It's like when a child gets in trouble, they look around for the nearest kid, point & say,""BUT THEY DID IT TOO-OOO-OOO! No fair!"" because they don't want to face the consequences. Here we have an alleged adult in his seventies that STILL behaves this way & has helped enable a political party full of socially-stunted assholes to behave the same."
22-3-3-1,"It's not just him, his followers are all exactly like that.  If you mention something this giant turd did, they shoot back with ""what about [insert Democrat's name]???"" It's like, yeah, if that other person did shady shit, throw the goddamn book at them, idgaf if they're a Democrat or not.  Meanwhile, they'll just keep defending this asshole forever.  I mean, if you took Trump's name out of every article about what he's done and replaced it with ""Obama,"" they'd be demanding a public execution."
22-3-4,"And his cult spreads the message far and wide, every single time."
22-3-4-1,"He supposedly has less than 4 million follows on his truth so-so website.I found this blurb:""Sadly, the media in our Country is so afraid of being sued that they never want to mention anything having to do with the corrupt Election of 2020!"" Trump argued.[This guy is perpetually pot-kettle-black. His image needs to be on this wiki page.["
22-3-4-1-2,Keep in mind some followers on Truth Social will follow new accounts that haven't posted anything yet. That's not suspicious at all.
22-4,Does the opposition get to garnish legal fees from the loser?
22-4-1,"Pff, good luck, they guy is broke. He’s have to sell everything he owns and it still wouldn’t be enough"
22-4-1-2,Lol he is nowhere near broke. He has received millions of dollars in donations from his supporters.
22-4-1-2-1,"He owes millions of dollars in interest yearly. Dude has been treading water since the early 90s. He's been borrowing from Peter to pay Paul for decades and you can only shift debt around so long. He has perpetually overextended himself far beyond what his assets were worth, moving from one scheme to the next and stiffing everyone he could along the way. He's been shut off from most banks lending to him for ages, and even the one bank that would deal with him has been under more scrutiny for doing so, making it less likely he will find anyone who will bail him out again. The shell game is coming to an end."
22-4-1-2-1-1,"> The shell game is coming to an end.People have been saying these things for years. I'll believe it when I see it. Other than getting kicked off social media, Trump has never had to deal with any consequences for his actions and I don't see that changing."
22-4-1-2-1-1-1,"It only kept going because he managed to be lent more money. The tap has been turned off.DB was one of the last banks that would have anything to do with him, and even then it was seen as very shady as to why they would. Since then, DB has had a lot more scrutiny over money laundering, which is likely one of the reasons (among many) why they will no longer lend him money."
22-4-1-2-2,Not that he will use it to pay the lawyers or give to help gop Senate candidates.  It's mine!
22-4-1-2-2-2,"He is notorious for not paying his lawyers, or just bills in general."
22-4-1-4,"Or he just keeps soliciting the fan base for donations to fight the rigged elections, or whatever the fuck is on his mind at any given second.  Those personalized emails that people believe are true. ""My father was asking the other night why you hadn't donated yet, since he knows you're one of his biggest supporters."""
22-4-1-5,"It's worse than that.  He has no personal assets.  Every personal expense is a business expense tied to some company.  It's why his home is a ""golf club"" and not a residence."
22-4-1-5-1,"He owns Mar-a-Lago though, which is an extremely valuable asset (valued by Forbes at $160 mil), and he lived there even when he was supposed to be living in the White House because he likes it there. I wish that he was broke, but he still has a lot of money (though not nearly as he pretends to have)."

22-5-1-1-1-2,One of the few times he wasn't lying.
22-5-1-1-1-2-1,No he lied about that too (in 2016) because he still said the election was rigged.
22-5-2,"the right's badass man's man whose catch phrases are basically ""you can't make me"" and ""i'm telling""...you know, like a tough guy"
22-5-2-1,"""why are people so mean?"""
22-5-2-1-1,That one simple sentence encapsulates his malignant narcissism perfectly.
22-5-2-1-1-1,> “why are people so mean?”…”to me?”You have to add that last part to truly capture the malignant narcissism.
22-5-4,That's how he forces his opponents to stay quiet ... if Trump wrongs you and you file suit he will file multiple lawsuits against you for all possible things he can think of to make you starve financially responding to all those lawsuits.
22-5-4-1,"In Australia, multiple vexatious actions can get you essentially banned from suing anyone"
23,My neighbor took down his trump sign today
23-1,Just because people are abandoning Trump doesn’t mean they’ll abandon the GOP
23-1-1,"Exactly. The GOP does this every 4-8 years. I mean, now every Republican hates Bush?!? He had like 92% support. They'll turn on everyone.Edit: Hate Romney too now!!!"
23-1-1-1,Isn't that mostly because they got all mad when they saw that he was friends with Michelle Obama?
23-1-1-1-1,"I mean maybe it's a part of that, but there's something bigger. Romney is far too reasonable. He compromises. He speaks up for partisan ethics from time to time.Look at what happened to Boehner, the last member of the GOP who tried to whip a good faith compromise.edit: look, context; it's a relative statement, not the absolute one some people here heard. I meant to say he's too reasonable for \*them\*. Don't forget romney pushed the big lie before he spoke against it. Also remember he gave brand new air to birtherism in 2012. Or anything else about his 2012 campaign."
23-1-1-1-1-1,"Romney is trying to play the middle. He has his eyes on the Presidency. He's a corporate raider to the core, don't be deceived."
23-1-1-1-1-1-3,How can we tell he doesn't just have moderate views versus playing the middle?Don't most politicians want to be president?
23-1-1-1-1-1-3-1,He stuck to his principles when it was not good politics to do so unlike a lot of the gop that calibrate their beliefs every 10am when trump wakes up.  He was willing to throw his political career away which is a rare thing and the mark of a statesman. Whatever your thoughts are about his policies or anything else that was impressive.
23-1-1-1-1-1-5,"Romney is one of the biggest recipients of NRA money, I believe."
23-1-1-1-2,He also voted to impeach Trump
23-1-1-1-2-1,"Twice. He was the first Senator in US history to cross party lines in his vote to convict.I know that's a low bar, but we should at least acknowledge when something right is done."
23-1-2,"If there's a schism between Trump and the establishment GOP, it makes the GOP weaker and may depress turnout because some Trump cultists won't vote"
23-1-2-1,"Mitch McConnell has been working against such a schism every day since Trump came along. Trump has been working for such a schism, or at least constantly threatening it to assert control. It’s a weird dance. Neither man has a fucking shred of dignity."
23-1-2-2,"If you will remember, lots of people who had never voted in their lives only became republicans because of Trump. Specifically uneducated whites. I’m speculating, but I think those people won’t show up for anyone other than Trump or likely Desantis. So the GOP is stuck with those two."
23-1-3,"Maybe not, but sometimes they do.  The last six years, lots of Republicans have left the fold as they realize their party has no solutions, just grievances and hate.  And lots of fence-sitters have realized they can't throw vulnerable people under the bus with their vote.One important step is talking to actual liberals or leftists, and realizing they're not the monsters shown on Fox News.  More people are needed to do this essential work.If you're ready, join r/VoteDEM and volunteer for a Democratic campaign.  This year, with Roe likely gone and LGBT people under open attack, it's more important than ever."
23-1-3-1,"I am just not seeing ""lots of Republicans"" leaving the fold (conservative/christian ideology)."
23-1-3-1-2,">I am just not seeing ""lots of Republicans"" leaving the fold (conservative/christian ideology).It doesn't need to be lots, even 2-5% would swing a lot of elections around the country. If 2% of Republican voters decide to stay home instead, even this can be enough."
23-1-4,Yep.  This is the sad truth.
23-1-5,"Yeah they think its because Trump doesn't represent the GOP anymore when in reality he's exactly what they're about, they just want to go back to pretending they aren't. In some cases, dumping Trump is probably worse. They just get to slink back into the shadows and keep voting fascist"
23-1-5-1,"Trump absolutely represents the GOP. He is the fucking embodiment of the GOP. They all have the same prejudice, the same fucked up selfish worldview. The only difference is that he Trump says those things out loud where as the rest of them hide like cowards behind a veneer of dishonesty and hypocrisy."
23-2,I’ll believe it when I see it
23-2-2,"Yeah, this whole thing is just wishful thinking. I guess a few people are flipping, but I don't see it happening in any significant numbers. I've heard people say that the latest Trump thing is *really going to get him this time* every few months for the past five years. Nothing ever sticks. The system is designed to protect people like him, and I wish people would start to recognize that."
23-2-2-4,"They do realize that, but they keep trying anyway because to give up is to let these fuckers win. Better to go down fighting than to roll over."
23-2-2-5,"Yep.  Toss a few minnows in the frying pan, embarrass a few of the bigger fish.  Let millions of people show their social and financial support for the bad actors.  Everyone's afraid of ""riling up their supporters"", so they just keep it on a slow burn with nothing really happening.Rinse and repeat forever.It makes me wonder how bad things would be today had Nixon refused to resign and all the Republicans voted against removal from office."
23-2-4,Hate to be a pessimist but its not over.. 2024 isn't even here yet and we have a few authoritarian old people to worry about. My greatest fear........Ivanka......Edit: sp whoops
23-2-4-1,I wouldn't.. they are still a very sexist group at heart. Worry about DeSantis.
23-2-4-1-2,I worry about him and Abbott.
23-2-4-1-2-1,Abbott doesn't have a leg to stand on.
23-2-4-1-3,"I've seen multiple Republicans try to literally call him an ""American hero"", so yeah, he will probably be the one."
23-3,"My mom took down the trump flag on Jan 6th.  Bet your ass she’ll still vote for him if he’s running. They’re not giving up, just putting it in the pantry for a minute."
23-3-1,You should go raid that pantry
23-3-1-1,"I try. I love her. But she’s nutso. RN that posts antivax shit, yet begrudgingly got the vaccine. She’s well off, so she’ll never change. Best I can do is cancel out her vote when we go on election days."
23-3-1-1-1,"“RN that posts antivax shit” Yeah, she should be removed from the registry."
23-3-1-1-1-1,"She’ll be retiring within the year. She works from home. I can attest that she does recommend proper protocols (vaccines and such) to patients. Personally, she was spouting bullshit. Professionally, she was adhering to best practices. Otherwise, I’d report her ass myself.  She got herself and her side of the family vaccinated. I have no valid explanation for her reasonings."
23-3-1-1-1-2,Like half the nurses in this country are conservative anti vaxx but just the Covid one.
23-3-1-1-1-2-1,"I would not say half, I work in a hospital and we had a couple anti vaxxers in our staff, but the large majority got their vaccine with no complaints.This is in a very red state as well."
23-3-2,"Even those that say they are, the anger will get them to vote again for the angry."
23-4,Dumping trump doesn't mean much if they vote for desantis anyway
23-4-1,He scares me more than trump. He's cut from the same cloth just smarter
23-4-1-1,"Seriously, the only saving grace from the Trump term is that he was so incompetent."
23-4-1-1-1,I’m more concerned with local election boards not approving votes if the winner is not from their party.
23-4-1-1-1-1,This is the biggest threat. I still find it mind bending and this scotus would allow it
23-4-1-1-1-1-1,It is the Supremacist Court of the United States now. The majority are for corporate and fascist rule.
23-4-1-2,"Yes, he know that you're not supposed to say the quiet parts out loud."
23-4-1-2-1,I thought “saying the quiet parts out loud” was a part of the appeal of Trump to Trumpsters.
23-4-1-2-1-1,"He does the Mitch McConnell. Absolutely goes for the same regressive policies while having the actual political knowhow to get them passed. He's also not dumb enough to actually commit crimes in office, and if he does, he's smart enough to do a better job covering it up rather than being as blatant as Trump was. That's the scary part. Him being pro-life, anti-CRT, and supporting all the generic Republican talking points is enough to garner support as the ""non-crazy"" Republican candidate. He doesn't need the blatantly racist/sexist/authoritarian theatrics to gain the support of the far right, as long as the rest of the GOP rallies behind him."
23-4-1-2-1-1-3,I'm curious what you think about this. My horror at the Trump campaign and presidency was largely around how his brazen indifference to political correctness emboldened open and violent bigotry against anything non normative. And his disregard for the political system and checks and balances. Would DeSantis still create the same toxic culture this way?
23-4-1-3,"""$marter"""
23-4-1-3-1,Not as dumb might work here
23-4-1-3-3,"Yes, smarter. Trump is Idiocracy come to life. Desantis is trash but he is coherent."
23-4-2,"She wrote that her parents will never vote republican again.  I don’t blame them.  Unfortunately people vote with the party, not for the most qualified"
23-4-4,Biden and desantis voter here.Im usually a 3rd party voter.  First time since George W's first election i voted R or D for POTUS.  Trump had to go.As for the desantis vote.  Gillum was a terrible candidate the Ds offered.  Worse in my mind than Ron.  Im not happy with Desantis but i doubt Gillum would have made me happy either.  Hell he went off the rails in March of 2020 shortly after his loss.  I do hope his rehabilitation is going well.
23-4-5,"That's what I'm doing.  I really didn't like Trump, but I knew Biden wasn't a good choice and with Kamala, it I was positive.  The results speak for themselves.  I wish there was a better choice but the left has gone too far with everything for me and most people I know.  I can't point to a single successful policy and the Trump obsession is getting ridiculous, the man has been removed and silenced by media for the most part and still it continues.  Jan 6, the day we almost lost our democracy made me spit coffee.  A couple hundred morons are not your political opposition any more than BLM represented most democrats, it just didn't.  These extremes are dividing us and I'm not sure if we can get back to the middle with no one capable of conversation that matters."
23-4-5-1,"The Republican party leaders, the figureheads, the spokesmen, the cheerleaders, the pundits, every last one of them championed the messaging that lead to the 6th. They knowingly deceived republican voters with the explicit intent of subverting our democracy.If the literal representatives of the party, nominated and elected by the party, don't represent the party, then what in creation does?"
23-4-5-1-1,"As long as you understand that parties left and right are equally terrible, otherwise I can't entertain your idea because it would be dead ass wrong and delusional.  The system is rigged to only give us terrible choices.  Trump?  Biden? Harris?  These are some of the worse choices we could have and yet here we are feeling powerless to stop the machine."
23-4-5-2,Donald Trump and members of the Republican party committed crimes. They should be prosecuted.>I can't point to a single successful policyUh...you can't? You must not pay attention. Major stuff obviously gets blocked because of the Senate.Here is a simple one. Democrats voted yes on making insulin have a price cap. All that needs to happen now is 10 Republicans voting yes in the Senate. Watch it not happen.
23-5,It's sad because you can dump Trump all you want but you can't dump his 3 Supreme court justice appointees that our unborn future grandchildren will have to deal with.
23-5-3,"Or Biden can pack the courts, who knows"
23-5-3-1,Biden lost his chance to really change the political landscape. Not because of the 50 Republican senators but because of the two Democratic senators. The next two years are going to be two years of nothingness
24,"Trump Must Pay Hillary Clinton $171,631 in Legal Fees Over Bogus Lawsuit"
24-1,">  Hours after Middlebrooks' filing became public, Trump withdrew a lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James that also happened to be before Middlebrooks. The judge had referenced the suit against James in his order on Thursday, noting it had ""all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.""Icing on the cake."
24-1-1,Something about James says she'd have people come down to Trump Tower and publicly start taking things to add up to a fine amount. Just as a fuck you to the Orange Menace
24-1-1-2,"Make it a reality show special, a language he understands."
24-1-1-2-1,He doesn't understand any language.
24-1-1-2-1-1,"Honestly, I've never seen him be able to directly answer a question. Always slightly parallel to reality. Never being able to comprehend what's being said. So yeah, for real."
24-1-1-2-1-1-1,"This is going to be like Reagan, we can all see that this man is serious mental decline, but we have to bothsides and pretend it's normal and in 20 years the records will be released and gee-whiz, that guy WAS totally off his rocker!But at least we'll have learned an important lesson! /s"
24-1-1-2-1-1-1-1,All the wrong lessons
24-1-1-2-1-1-2,"If you watch interviews with him from 20 years ago he's a lot more coherent. Still an arrogant asshole, but the brain fog hadn't really settled in yet."
24-1-1-3,Start by Snatching up that gold toilet.
24-1-1-3-1,Isn't his whole apartment and office at Trump Tower covered in gold stuff? Apparently it's so bad that the Apprentice was supposed to be filmed in his actual office but the studio refused and built a set when they saw it.
24-1-1-3-1-1,"I'm sure he insisted that they film in his place so then he could charge rent to the show and grift them out of extra cash, as well as writing it off tax wise as a business expense."
24-1-1-3-1-1-1,Doesn't he still owe millions to cities across the US for all those rallies he held? Those cities need to go after him harder for the money owed.
24-1-1-3-1-1-1-1,They won't see a dime of that money.
24-1-1-3-1-1-2,He probably did that anyway. Look at all the crime & corruption he’s gotten away with. He’s in his 70’s with zero repercussions for any of them.
24-1-1-3-1-2,"Close (I worked on celebrity apprentice)We never planned to shoot in his actual offices it would have been way too restricting to the shooting schedule.But we WERE forced to rent out space in the tower in which to build the set.He wasn't willing to travel for his shoot days.I wasn't involved in the costs, but I'm sure we were overcharged for the space.And before anyone asks, I was doing props, I never interacted with him, and don't have any damning stories.Well, except for when we unveiled the new Bud Light margarita series on the show, and broke a trucks lift gate because we were rushed for time. Turns out a hamper full of drinks is heavy as fuck, a surprise to nobody with sense."

24-1-1-3-1-3-1-1,Was at the Trump Taj Mahal in the late 80s or early 90s and the one thing that struck me was how ugly everything was.
24-1-1-3-1-5,It's covered in guilt and gold plate then just marble panels. Dude wanted to make his apartment Versailles and it looks garish.
24-1-1-3-1-5-1,Trump is into gilt not guilt.  Tacky tacky man.
24-1-1-3-2,"I don't care how much he owes me, I'm not accepting anything his ass has touched."
24-1-1-3-2-3,100% agree with this

24-1-4-1,"All former presidents are referred to with that title. Introducing him as President Trump is, unfortunately, still correct, just as it is for President Obama and President Bush"
24-2,LOL imagine all the suckers who gave money to Trump only for him to spend it to pay Hillary's lawyers.
24-2-1,Do you think they're tired of winning yet?
24-3,They should double it every time he tries to appeal it.
24-3-1,"The suit was dismissed with prejudice.  ~~With prejudice means absolutely no do-overs.~~Sigh, there is no such thing as absolutely no do-overs, (unless you are too poor).  I have been informed by several who clearly are better informed.Trump will have a fit when he has to write out that check.  If only there were a secret video of that moment.Edit add, Trump withdrew his lawsuit against the Atty General of NY a few hours later.  I love perp Fridays. and a second edit because IANAL."
24-3-1-1,There is 0% chance he pays that publicly. He will claim he’s never paying a penny. Even if they show the check on national television he will claim it’s all a hoax and his legion of blind idiots that are going to vote for him will believe him.
24-3-1-1-1,We literally saw the check he used to illegally pay off Stormy Daniels and that bombshell went down the memory hole just as fast as the rest of the shit
24-3-1-1-1-1,It's an interesting strategy to create so many scandals in such a short period of time that people can't remember what you even did.
24-3-1-1-1-1-1,Firehose of falsehood - Wikipedia 
24-3-1-2,Is he still suing CNN? I was legitimately looking forward to that one. Because of discovery.
24-3-1-2-1,"His lawsuits never go anywhere. He drags them on forever on purpose, then cuts them if they ever get close to trial. Because he knows better than anyone that if anyone were to force discovery, they'd find where the bodies are buried.The lawsuits are just a bullying/stalling tactic."
24-3-1-2-1-1,he does everything for the headline.  he is the human incarnation and embodiment of a publicity stunt.
24-3-1-2-1-1-1,"December 3, 2020 [On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany boasted that Donald Trump was honoring World AIDS Day unlike any other president — when, in fact, the White House commemoration dates back to George W. Bush.]"
24-3-1-2-1-1-1-1,"Actually, I could believe that.  Trump probably spent the day either golfing or watching TV."
24-3-1-2-1-1-2,"DwSantis is in hot competition, as is Abbott"
24-3-1-2-1-1-2-1,Competition to look the most conservative. I sometimes wish that we still had duels so that these guys could have it out amongst each other and we would have one or two less to worry about.
24-3-1-2-1-2,"Which is funny because it works against small fries that don't have the money to defend, but CNN is a multi-billion dollar company that doesn't give a shit."
24-3-1-2-1-2-1,"And remember, everything is projection. Trump isn’t anywhere close to being a billionaire but pretends to be. Therefore he likely assumes no one else actually has billions to spend. He’s used to the average person who he does have more money than, he’s not used to going up against people who can multiple his spending tenfold."
24-3-1-2-1-2-1-1,That is exactly why he never went against Cuban or Bloomberg who mocked him publicly every chance they got.
24-3-1-2-1-4,"Yep, as per SLAPP lawsuits, or more broadly a patrician design of the US court system since the country’s inception.Of course Trump is too transactional to be aware of any of that: someone just told him the system is rife for opportunities to abuse…"
24-3-1-2-1-4-1,Is SLAPP a federal policy? I was under the impression that some US jurisdictions didn’t permit it. Maybe I’m thinking of something else.
24-3-1-4,"He will never write that cheque, the law firm that took him as a client to file it are idiots for still not knowing that."
24-3-1-4-1,Didn't they require up front payments?
24-3-1-4-1-1,"There is no way they did not make him pay a retainer. That is very standard for law firms, and it is absolutely necessary with Trump."
24-3-1-4-1-1-1,But that is supposed to pay THEIR fees not the opposing counsel's.
24-3-2,"No, not double it. He won’t learn. Square it, then he’ll learn!"
24-3-2-1,Punishments only work as deterrence if the recipient can understand them.
24-3-2-1-1,Then Trump's punishment should be no more golf or hamburders ever plus the money
24-3-2-1-1-1,"At least until he pays his fine, and apply it to every fine he’s issued.He wants to act like a child, he should be treated like one and be grounded for breaking the rules."
24-3-2-1-1-1-1,*Trump grounded and forced to sit in a corner at Mar a Lago until he has learned his lesson*
24-3-2-1-1-1-1-1,This would be funny if he was not so much of a child that it might actually work.
24-3-2-1-1-2,throw in no more spray tan and adult diapers
24-3-2-1-1-2-1,We're already having to clean up his shit.
24-3-2-1-1-2-2,"There are a lot of pictures of him lately without the spray tan, and all I can say is that he needs that spray tan. He looks like a fat corpse without it."
24-3-2-1-1-2-3,Maybe let him keep the diapers.  Nobody else deserves to have to clean that up.
24-3-2-1-1-5,and no more sex with porn stars...
24-3-2-1-2,Only needs to happen once and he’s bankrupt for good in this case.
24-3-2-1-2-1,The math works out to about $29 billion dollars. Might be a little steep even if I hate the guy.
24-3-2-1-2-1-1,Sounds just fine to me.
24-3-2-1-2-1-1-1,I see what you did there.
24-3-2-1-2-1-4,That wouldn't even begin to touch the damage he's done to the country. Take him for all he's worth.
24-3-2-1-2-1-5,"Sounds steep, but you'd absolutely reconsider appealing it, wouldn't you? Even Bezos and Musk would have to balk at that option - where now, they just appeal it and hope for a better result for relative pennies."
24-3-2-1-5,Also only if you can get them to pay it. Trump owes money to a lot of people but uses the court system to delay payment indefinitely.
24-3-2-2,Not just when he appeals but when he misses the deadline to pay as we know he will.  He won’t pay unless it has severe consequences.  And Hillary should post the check on Instagram when he eventually does pay with a note that says “thanks for the buttery males Donnie”
24-3-2-2-1,She may as well just sell it to a collections agency now.
24-3-5,"He'll just start another bogus money raising scam and fleece his flock for more cash, and they'll give it to him since they think he's some kind of messiah figure."
24-4,"Mmmmm, this is a delicious morsel. He is the most overly-sensitive little weirdo and you know this is going to absolutely enrage him.  I wonder how r/Conservative reacts to this low-energy L he's taking."

24-4-4,Dude literally cashed a check for $3. This is gonna sting deep.
24-4-4-1,"I dunno about a $3 check, but he's so money hungry that he famously cashed a 13 CENT check back in 1990."
24-5,"Rubes: you can expect more donation-seeking, ""America-First /Anti-Woke"" spam in the next few days.Oh, no worries: they're not gonna use the donations to pay Hillary. But the *news* of the ruling is just too good of a money-maker to not spur an immediate cash-grab."
24-5-1,"Imagine conservative heads across the land exploding as they find out their hard earned money donated to Trump was just going straight into Hillary's bank account? Hillary should send them all thank you notes; just to be polite, of course."
24-5-1-1,"If she ever does get money, she should very publicly donate it to the Clinton Foundation as a reminder that the Clinton's are still allowed to have one."
24-5-1-1-1,"Ouch, good one"

25-1-1,"I live in NY. After the 2016 election but before Trump was sworn in, my husband and I were waiting at the bank along with some others (there was a wait list to speak with someone for non-teller actions). My husband and I were sitting and talking about what a Trump presidency might mean (clearly being not super excited, but trying to keep to ourselves). A man (probably in his mid 50s) overheard us and said ""just want to say, I've worked in construction and real estate in the area for decades, and unfortunatelt had to work for and with Trump's companies before. Whatever you've heard or will hear about him, believe me, it's worse.""The fact that he got anywhere near public office is mind boggling honestly. We'll be paying for it as a nation for decades in multiple ways."
25-1-1-1,"Trump had more than a half century of conning experience before taking office.  He's perhaps one of the most prolific grifters ever.  It's not terribly surprising he managed to dupe millions of people at once, especially given the tribal nature of politics.  Consistent republican voters tend to be the opposite of discerning."
25-1-1-1-1,But he’s also clearly very stupid. That’s why I was surprised. I really thought the average person could at least see that.
25-1-1-1-1-1,Man's like the savant of grifting imo.

I'm being apolitical not for or against.  But I ask what is our current president doing for working families?That you feel directly at your kitchen table? Not taking either side just asking a question. I honestly cannot tell if Biden is lucid and coherent.  Who may be running the country behind the scene's.  The dude is questionable.Just an opinion.  So let's keep it non toxic and demeaning.  Just what do you think.  We all know lots of people hate Trump. Let's just talk, man.  Nobody does these days.Just talk about it.Cheers."
25-1-1-1-3-1,"> I honestly cannot tell if Biden is lucid and coherent. Who may be running the country behind the scene's. The dude is questionable.Then you need to actually watch him speak, not the edited clips on Fox or OANN.The infrastructure bill is a huge deal for working families.  So is student debt relief.  Not sure what you want him to do or what exactly you think the powers of the President are versus Congress.  It's pretty obvious your political stance though."
25-1-1-1-3-1-1,Ya I'm waiting for the shovel ready projects to begin.  Along with billions being ripped off.Not at all student debt cool.  There is no way gov will be able to account for the billions being designated for projects. Or when they will even start.I work for the gov.Obama tried the same thing. Look what happened.
25-1-1-1-4,Look if the Feds got Al Capone they'll get Trump.
25-1-1-1-4-1,The tax man got him.
25-1-1-2,My ex's grandfather has run a construction/insulation business for a long ass time in NY. A few years back his business got contracted to do work on some Trump property. They never got paid and he hated Trump ever since. Wouldn't even speak his name and would get heated any time he was mentioned.Flash forward to 2016 and that same man now thinks Trump is a God send and he's the only thing that can save this country. He also complains about illegal immigration while also regularly hiring undocumented immigrants for cheap labor. I can't for the life of me understand these fucking people.
25-1-1-2-1,Lmao my dad hated trump when he thought he was a democrat. Now that he’s a Republican he’s got his nose buried in his ass and the man can do no wrong. It’s convenient.
25-1-1-2-1-1,"Its like a fucking bizzaro world to me. It's not hard to objectively look at trumps past and the shit he's said and done and go ""yeah he's not fit for the presidency"". It's not even a Republican vs Democrat issue. Trump is a lieing manipulative scum bag who has a history of lieing and cheating his way to get what he wants. I just don't understand these people."

25-1-3,"Glad he said this, if true. Penn is, or at least has been, an avid libertarian and said on the record that he wanted a *(paraphrasing here)* outside the beltway, non-political, non-career candidate for President; a President that didn't think he was smart enough to wield the power of the office, so wouldn't be tyrannical. Trump fulfilled that wish in the worst of ways. I think there's still good reason to want to move away from politicians that avail themselves to variously powerful people (be it political connections, wealth, or fame), but, I hope Penn (a kind of hero of mine for a very long time) is willing to take a more nuanced approach to our desired representatives.Also, Penn patented a hot-tub that's designed to pleasure women. He's got a lot going on, but he still found time."
25-1-3-1,"Penn *also* said that Trump would make a terrible president though, and encouraged everyone who would listen to vote against him. Penn came second on a series of celebrity Apprentice, so had enough face-to-face time with Trump to know exactly how giant of a douchebag he is."

25-2-1,"Trump likes the Saudi's, they buy his hotel rooms and don't even use them. Real estate hotels are just a big grift, money laundering operation. How do you bankrupt a casino? Launder money and declare bankruptcy to bury the secrets. His father and father before him were just the same with close ties to Russian Mafia."
25-2-1-1,Blows my mind that anyone thought he should be president and then it happened. What a fucking world we live in.
25-2-1-1-1,Oh there was an entire complex network that made Trump the Golden child for the right wing. Lots of foreign propaganda help
25-2-1-1-1-2,The guy literally meme’d his way into the white house. I personally believe people were sick of the same tired OLD people as president and literally voted for the most radical changeup on the table. Clinton represented the old ways and so people “voted for the worst” on purpose the first time.The guy spoke and acted like 2007 era youtube comments
25-2-1-1-1-3,Damn is it foreign idiot's that has my neighbors calling my roommate the N-word? Or has America always been this bigoted and you're just starting to notice?
25-2-1-1-1-3-1,I don’t think you understand what I mean. Foreign interests didn’t light it but they are throwing gasoline on the fire.  Our foreign enemies see the internet as the greasiest weapon in modern history since the atomic bomb.  The internet and it’s social media platforms have become the perfect instrument and platform for very real propaganda. They’ve created propaganda with deliberate intentions of dividing the country…And they’re having success.Putin has tremendous interest in weakening the west and in particular NATO.
25-2-1-1-2,Thought? They’re still screaming for it. How he got so many stupid people to believe everything anyone says about him is a lie is beyond me.
25-2-1-1-2-1,He gave them permission to hate. That’s all it took.Who’d have thought all you needed to do to earn the undying loyalty of 30% of the population is spend a few hours watching Fox News every day and regurgitating their rhetoric on Twitter?
25-2-1-1-2-1-1,"I remember back when it was still the primaries and he used the term ""anchor babies"" and all the other candidates were acting surprised he said it. They tried to distance themselves away from the term, but Fox News was saying that shit for years. Of course it was going to land with the audience they molded like clay. Why shouldn't Trump say it?"
25-2-1-1-2-1-1-1,McCain would have won if he did not correct that woman at the town hall meeting who said Obama was a Muslim terrorist.
25-2-1-1-4,Boggles my mind that anyone thinks he should be president a SECOND time
25-2-1-1-5,Anything to own the libs!
25-2-1-3,Real estate in general is a shit show. It's a way for rich people to bury money into assets. Art is another big money laundering scheme
25-2-1-3-1,"Sure wish some rich person wanted to bury their millions buying mine and my friends artwork  Maybe then we wouldn't be ""starving artists"" "
25-2-1-3-1-1,"Get it into a high end gallery auction.Art isn't used to bury wealth though, its used to launder money. Buy it for X amount in dirty money to set a value for it and then make an anonymous private sale later for X+ In clean money.There's little to no requirements for reporting personal information for buyers and sellers in art trading. Mexican cartels used to be some the most prodigious art traders in the world.Real estate is a little different in that its an asset that builds worth over time, when you have money you don't necessarily want it all as straight cash in a bank account, you want to diversify your money into different avenues to both store wealth and accrue it be it stocks and bonds, real estate, etc.It can however be used to hide money from the government by buying foreign real estate. Which is likely one of the big reasons there's been so many foreign nationals are buying property in places like London, LA, Seattle, Vancouver, etc. And never occupying them."
25-2-1-3-1-1-1,They’d like you over at r/IllegalLifeProTips
25-2-1-3-1-1-1-1,Art is straight forward enough as a money launder operation because it can be done anonymously or close enough to it because there's not really any reporting requirements for sellers and buyers. Mexico did introduce some stricter requirements for buyers and it cratered the market because so much of the trading was being done by cartels. Real estate is a whole different ball game because of the sheer amount of paperwork behind it. You're talking lawyers and shell companies to hide the identity of the true owner. It's more a tax evasion game than anything else and the amount of money needed to do it let alone be worth bothering with is staggering.
25-2-2,"And Russians.Edit: well, Russia might not have had to pay for them actually"
25-2-2-2,What if its proven that info trump provided resulted in russia invading the ukraine.
25-2-2-2-3,"Just Ukraine, please. “The Ukraine” implies it is a region, rather than its own sovereign country."
25-3,If Trump gets indicted then this is probably a much bigger deal than they are letting on.
25-3-1,Yeah; I think the last crime a president was charged with was speeding
25-3-1-2,"Well, seeing as how Trump is literally saying the exact same things that Nixon said..."
25-3-1-2-1,Is this what they mean by the good ol days?
25-3-2,"Trump had information that our intel community uses to determine which missile is going where, and after who. He had those in his cellar, his desk drawer… you really think the other alphabet agencies aren’t invested in this situation? Just wait…."
25-3-2-1,If they’re not then we’re in even bigger trouble than any of us might realize.
25-3-2-1-1,"Yeah, if true that would mean that the US has to now rewrite their entire nuclear defense strategy. That's a big fuckin deal..."
25-3-2-1-1-1,"Yep, already being done."
25-3-2-1-1-4,Dude Rex Tillerson was head of the State Dept. Exxon Mobile was basically in charge of the CIA. Anything and everything probably happened.
25-3-2-1-1-4-1,The CIA doesn't answer to the State Department.
25-3-2-1-2,He’d better get indicted because if he’s not he’s probably going to win (because why wouldn’t he at this point?) and then we’re SUPER fucked.
25-3-2-1-2-1,I was about to disagree with you because Trump's antics have just turned away too many moderate Republicans.  But then I realize the Republican strategy for winning the presidency hasn't been about getting the most votes in a long time now.
25-3-2-1-2-1-3,"Trump kept a 90% approval rating with republicans during his entire presidency and expanded the number of registered republicans. In 2020 he got more votes than anyone in history except joe biden.Don’t feed this lie that “moderate” republicans don’t like trump. They fucking love him, and if democrats don’t turn out in record numbers for every election until he dies, we’re going to see the 2nd trump term."
25-3-2-5,"Well, were waiting.gif"
25-3-3,"As a guy with a security clearance I can tell you that if I did even a small fraction of what Trump did, I would have been disappeared and even my own family would question if I ever existed.The fact that he's still walking around is an indictment of our justice system. The fact that we have to question whether he'll even be punished is unbelievable. Real human beings died because Trump wanted an EYES ONLY coffee table book."
25-3-3-2,As someone with for a former high level clearance who had the literal job of securing classified information (US Army S-2 NCOIC) I can confirm you wouldn't have been disappeared.  You'd be in jail and made an example to the intelligence community to deter future fuck-ups.
25-3-3-3,"I have had the unfortunate duty of being involved in the legal processing of persons with security clearances doing something warranting punishment.The worst situation I saw was a dude whose bank made a mistake. Letter came in the mail that he missed a payment ($ doesn't matter in these cases it could be a penny and you're fucked, but for him it was a little over 300 USD) on a loan. A loan that had been paid off for nearly a year. Despite being in a highly valuable position, he permanently lost his clearance. Wife (no kids) left him. He (allegedly) committed suicide several months later.Had to process MANY of those exact scenarios. Far more of others, but that kinda shit sticks out.And I fucking sit seething at this literal, ACTUAL traitorous piece of shit just gallivanting about the country he obviously despises. This isn't even a matter of innocent until proven guilty. He had these documents. Their upkeep was not respected. No diligence was plied. Nothing."

They did, however, need to go through trainings, maybe face a suspension or leave without pay from work, but nobody lost their clearance or their job.  You had to do something really bad to have that happen from my experience."
25-3-3-3-1-1,"Fair enough, altho this did happen. Back in early 2008. One of those ""Make an example"" situations onboard USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3), which was flagship of 2nd Fleet at the time. They were quite litigious after the '07 deployment.Obviously it was a terrible mistake all around, and it did cease later in the year with changes of commands."
25-3-4,I hope he does get indicted but Garland also has to weigh the possibility of getting 12 honest people on a jury. All it takes is one Trumper to hang a jury and Trump declares victory and “total exoneration” before you can even blink.
25-3-4-2,I’m sure trumps team would rig the jury if necessary
25-4,"Here's a crazy idea: what if we were to act like we mean what we say about the value of democracy and the equality of all people before the law?  I know our justice system is an absolute fucking joke and a shitshow in practice a great deal of the time, particularly if you're not rich and/or not white.  But one of our major political parties has now committed itself to the idea that there's no such things as facts, and anything they can get away with is not only legal but approved by Jesus.  So it is PARTICULARLY FUCKING IMPORTANT at this historical moment that we reject their nihilistic bullshit.  We need to demonstrate that Presidents and public figures and people in whom public trust and public power are vested ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM THE LAW, and that, in fact, we hold them to a HIGHER standard.tl; dr: Lock. Him. Up."
25-4-2,"""When you come for the king you best not miss""I think at this point its all just CYA, and making sure every stitch is accounted for so theres no (sane) way anyone can deny justice was served. We all know people are still going to deny it and spin wild conspiracies, but for their sake it all has to be in perfect order."
25-4-4,"Question from an outsider: at what point does the ""silent majority""  no longer remain silent?  What will it take before hundreds of thousands of Americans march on Washington, demanding justice?"
25-4-5,Couldn't say it any better. This right here should be a headline. A long one yes but front page of every paper that cares about democracy.
25-5,"This whole thing has ruined government thrillers and dramas forever.X-Files, Enemy of the State, Conspiracy Theory, West Wing, House of Cards, Bourne Identity, every spy movie ever madeNah, man.

26,Ex-Rand Paul aide convicted of illegally funneling Russian cash to Trump campaign
26-1,Remember that time that [Rand Paul flew to Moscow to hand deliver a letter from Trump to Putin]? Pepperidge Farm remembers.It’s not like the US government has an [entire diplomatic wing] devoted to excelling at these kinds of tasks.
26-1-1,Remember when John McCain pretty much said that Rand Paul was a Russian asset?
26-1-1-1,"[I remember this exchange:]>	In a 2016 conversation with fellow members of House leadership, the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, suggested that Donald Trump was on Vladimir Putin’s payroll.>	In an exchange first reported by the Washington Post, McCarthy said: “There’s …there’s two people, I think, Putin pays: [California Representative Dana] Rohrabacher and Trump … [laughter] … swear to God.”>According to the transcript, speaker Paul Ryan immediately responded: “This is an off-the-record … [laughter] … NO LEAKS … [laughter] … alright?!”"
26-1-1-1-1,"Ryan was also the one that said ""No leaks! That's how you know this is a family"" and it was leaked in about 4 hours."
26-1-1-1-1-1,">""No leaks! That's how you know this is a family""A crime family"
26-1-1-1-2,Thanks for posting this. People often forget that the GOP has been actively protecting and elevating traitors for so long that their entire platform is subverting Democracy.
26-1-1-1-2-1,How do we show stupid people that they are being conned? Should we just lie to them like the GOP does? Even arresting and jailing traitors doesn't sway the MAGA voters.
26-1-1-1-2-1-2,"I do that sometimes. I’ll hear something like “AOC wants to turn your kids gay!” So I ask them who I should vote for, they say someone like desantis, and I respond with “the guy that was caught at the furry sex party? No way!”If they ask for any more details I just tell them to ‘do their own research’"
26-1-1-1-2-1-2-4,"No she wants to turn your kid educated, housed, nourished and healthy. A bridge too far for many Americans.Maybe you can tell your GOP friends you heard AOC wants to turn kids straight now, because that's how it works."
26-1-1-1-2-1-2-5,I’m still waiting for the COVID vaccine to turn me gay and frankly I’m starting to suspect that I’m stuck being straight
26-1-1-1-2-1-4,You can’t Argue with stupid. And you can’t rationalize with irrational people. We just have to wait for all the insane boomers to die. Good news is Covid helped with that a bit.
26-1-1-1-2-1-4-1,Young people have been waiting for old conservatives to die since the 1960's.

26-1-1-1-3,Thank God Rohrabacher and Trump were voted out (also that Ryan bowed out. That was a bonus.). But what new Republicans took their place on Putin's payroll?
26-1-1-1-3-1,"All of them. Whether directly or indirectly they are all supported by foreign nations - China, Russia, or Saudi Arabia."
26-1-1-1-3-1-1,The apartheid state of Israel
26-1-1-1-3-2,Devin fucking Nunes as well..
26-1-1-1-3-2-1,"Devin has entered the chat, see you in court for slander because no one is fucking a Nunes"
26-1-1-1-3-3,It almost does matter if any of them are being paid by Russia any more. Trump successfully convinced the Republicans to become a pro-russia anti-NATO party. Putin achieved his goal and that position will linger in the GOP for some time.
26-1-1-1-3-3-1,Yeah Trump coming out as anti-NATO was amazing. I’m no military fan but even I can see that the geopolitical situation is such that an alliance of nations is not a harmful thing.
26-1-1-1-3-3-1-1,it's also the US's flagship alliance. You don't have to be a fan of the military to realize how dangerous alienating your own military alliance is.
26-1-1-1-3-3-1-2,My younger brother who is a bleeding heart liberal was very anti-NATO until I explained to him the importance of it.
26-1-1-3,Could you imagine in an alternate timeline where all these connections to Russia were from Obama and how the GOP would react?
26-1-1-3-2,Same way we’re reacting honestly lol
26-1-1-3-3,I mean it was proven Hilary Clinton was colluding and meeting with Russian Agents and the dossier that was used to convict Trump of Collusion with Russia was literally made by the DNC with the help of Russian agents.So you dont actually have to imagine the scenario your talking about.The DNC got fined for it recently because they filed it under something else in their election finances instead of opposition research but that was the extent of what happened them.P.S. Russia plays both sides its their M.O. its just no Democrat has been punished for it and you only see the Republicans.
26-1-1-3-3-2,"Nice try, but no.  The dossier was compiled by a British former MI6 agent.  Clinton was not ""colluding and meeting with Russian Agents."""
26-1-1-3-3-2-1,"Fusion GPS is an agency that the Russian government acts through.Fusion GPS was hired by the Clinton Campaign to dig up dirt on Trump,  Remember Fusion GPS = Russian Government.Fusion GPS than hires Christopher Steele, a former MI6 Agent who was part of the Russia desk to create the Dossier.Russia was paying Christopher Steele to create the Dossier, and the DNC was paying Russia to pay Steele."
26-1-1-3-3-3,Snooze
26-1-1-4,"No! You know what’s important!?! HUNTER BIDENS LAPTOP get out of here with your direct point A to point B of Russian involvement in our elections!HUNTER BIDEN!(Maybe not that midterms are over it’s time to take a break, it’s all too much)Edit: typos"

The letter emphasized the importance of further engagement in various areas including countering terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming cultural exchanges,” Paul wrote"
26-1-2-1,the only reason to send a written letter is when you dont want an electronic copy to exist
26-1-2-2,"They found a copy of it:""Dear Vlad, I feel like I can call you Vlad because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day, it would be great to overthrow America together. I know I can't invade good as you but I think you'd be impressed with my ability to destroy things. I love you shirtless on a horse, he runs fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. That's why I sent Rand (he's dumb lol) I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be real world domination!"""
26-1-2-2-1,"Also included in the letter:  ""P.S.  Do you like me?""  With check boxes for yes and no."

26-1-2-3-1,Didn’t Jr or Eric (or both) actually try to have back channels installed between Trump and Russia?
26-1-2-3-1-1,The DNS server. But we’re not allowed to discuss that. Among other topics like how the concert massacre Vegas shooter was right wing and it was over gun rights...
26-1-2-3-1-1-1,What ever came out about the DNS server?
26-1-4,Remember when our government decided that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment no longer applies but forgot to tell us? We are failing as a nation and the end result will be enslavement for the vast majority of us if we don't begin assembling and doing more than commenting on social media
26-1-4-2,>We are failing as a nation and the end result will be enslavement for the vast majority of us if we don't begin assembling and doing more than commenting on social mediaIs it 2nd amendment time?!
26-1-4-2-1,"There's no winning with that in this day and age. At least not in a general sense of civil war. But thankfully that's not necessary when we can use our brains and stop playing the game of ""wait and see""."
26-1-4-2-1-1,"The US lost two wars against very underequipped forces, Vietnam and Iraq, I think it is somewhat feasable at the very least."
26-1-4-2-1-1-1,"I’ve hit human sized targets at distances of >1 mile with a rifle. I’m not an globally ranked elite marksman. I’m just pretty good. The fact that members of the US government aren’t regularly being sniped at long distances is all you need to know. Either the US federal law enforcement apparatus is more competent than we realize or there is no support for a rebellion among actually dangerous warfighters. And it’s almost certainly the latter. No meaningful resistance can be built on the backs of the fatass cowards the Right has. US deaths in the GWOT are ~5,100. An estimated 300,000-1,000,000 Iraqis alone were killed during the Iraq War. Any attempt at an American civil war will be swiftly and decisively crushed <48 hours. Anyone saying otherwise is either stupid or one of the aforementioned fatass coward “patriots”."
26-1-4-2-1-1-2,"""Lost"". They weren't trying to win but prolong the wars as long as possible for the sake of the Military Industrial Complex. The men and women who were sent to Vietnam were far smarter than us and stood up for themselves... that was the difference. Outsmarting the tyrannical fucks won't be difficult however and you're right...very feasible!"
26-2,All of these convictions where they are using the word funneling accurately is the reason why republicans are starting to use that word to refer to anyone donating to Democrats legally.
26-2-1,"Yep, diluting the meaning of the name of crimes so when people hear about republicans doing it on the news it won't sound like a big deal.  It adds to the 'both sides' appearance."
26-2-1-1,"See also: Grooming, insurrection, riot, terrorist, terrorism, threat, and more!"
26-2-1-1-1,Don't forget that now EVERYONE is *radical* as well.
26-2-1-1-1-1,"Ah, right, ""radical"" for not shooting the homeless for sport, and ""extremist"" for wanting the same healthcare every other leading country has, and ""far""-left for desiring basic things like vacation time and parental leave."
26-4,"Ah yes, the Paul family: as American as borscht and nesting dolls. Do libertarians still claim this shitheel?Edit: I have since learned that borscht is originally a Ukrainian dish. I managed to choose a controversial soup for my hacky joke, and I apologize."
26-4-1,I worked for Ron Paul in 2008. Jesse Benton actually got me a lobbying job for the Kochs. I worked with them until my boss and jesse were indicted. I now hate everything they stand for but they definitely had the wool pulled over my eyes when i was young

26-4-1-1-1,They might have to in front of congress… 
26-4-1-1-1-1,Never going to happen with a republican congress. Get to voting
26-4-1-3,"To be fair the platform Ron ran on in 2008 has very little in common with what Rand stands for. Ron is off the deep end now too, but 2008 he was trying to buck the GOP establishment.(I know Ron was always off the deep end in various ways, but now he's off the deep end with the GOP establishment)"
26-4-1-3-1,a lot of people seem to forget that the internet used to LOVE Ron Paul. I first heard of him back in the Digg and early reddit days.  He was a Bernie Sanders type figure to many people back then
26-4-1-3-1-1,"Oh I remember, but people were understandably very angry about jingoism back then and he was one of the only high profile people to say something about it. But who the internet should have gotten behind was Dennis Kucinich"
26-4-1-4,"I was also a big Ron Paul fan when he was running, he seemed genuine. And I leaned conservative pretty much all the way up until Trump became the president. I look back at Ron Paul's platform and just shake my head."

26-4-2-1,Sue the Paul family for tainting your brand.

26-4-4-3-1,"Oh, they definitely ban people they disagree with."
26-4-4-3-2,"They have started banning people and only allow ""flaired"" posts."

26-5-1-1-1-1,>Chicks with dicks.Such a weird phrase. On one level it seems like it would probably be an insult or offensive. But it's also acknowledging that they're women.
26-5-1-1-2,FXN literally said Twitter employees are only quitting because Musk will make them work. Sickening as the middle class erodes and everyone is getting more poor every year that FXN is brainwashing half the nation to blame the working class with no power.Then of course they went on the typical rant that young people are lazy and don't want to work and we need to be more like the generation that fought ww2 (for some random fucking reason).
26-5-1-1-2-1,"> FXN literally said Twitter employees are only quitting because Musk will make them work.Such a stupid take.Twitter has long been a very prestigious place to work if you're a tech person, and employees there have to be pretty good to make it.Compare Apple, where employees often wore t-shirts that said ""80 hours a week and loving it"" on them.Then contrast with Amazon, which is infamous for having such an awful work environment that people quit in the first six months despite excellent pay."

26-5-1-4,No collusion!
26-5-2,"This time really does feel different because he lost big on the midterms. The whole reason he got excuses from the GOP was because he won races by ginning up enthusiasm. But Trump single-handedly lost the senate, and his own supporters got bored of his announcement speech. What is even the use of having him around? He's a scandal-laden low-energy loser."
26-5-2-1,"They can step away from him IF they, themselves are not complicit. If they have dirty hands, we can expect them to continue the MAGA party line."

""It is reported that multiple agents have claimed to be from 'the county,' and have, without any evidence, __falsely accused the residents of casting fraudulent ballots__."">>The voting rights groups say the group's efforts to seek out areas where they believe voter fraud occurred has __largely focused on high-density housing areas and communities experiencing a growth in the number of minority voters__."
27-1-1,"Yes, much worse.>The lawsuit alleges that the U.S. Election Integrity Plan — led by Shawn Smith, an ally of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell — is sending armed members door-to-door in areas with large numbers of voters of color, questioning people about how they voted and **taking photographs of their homes**.Of course it's in areas with large numbers of minority voters, and there is an implicit threat in taking pictures of people's houses after accusing them of committing a crime."
27-1-1-1,Thank you. I forgot to include that quote. It’s the scariest of the bunch

27-1-1-2-1-1-3-2,"You'd be perfectly fine. The racism in the city is more systemic than anything else. You will be highly unlikely to experience any person being directly racist to you. it *could* happen if you run into a certain type of asshole, but it's not anymore likely than in another city."
27-1-1-2-1-1-4,"Well, then you aren’t blind, probably just a mute like majority of the population there since not nearly enough people in Omaha speak up about this kind of stuff."

I don't parade them around and shit. They are tools."
27-4-1-1-1-3-1,"Exactly. I remember reading an editorial in The Atlantic in which the author recounts gun use when he was a kid in rural Texas. Back then, guns were tools. “Never touch a gun you don’t plan to use, and never point a gun at anything except to shoot it,” he was always told. Nowadays they’re more toys and political props than anything else, like the guy with a rifle at Walmart."
27-4-1-1-3,"You're correct. The right-wing is eventually going to start shooting at their perceived enemies, whether the enemies know they're thought of as enemies or not.You'd better be able to shoot back."
27-4-1-1-3-1,"My foreman is a gun-loving, liberal-hating psychopath that regularly brags about how many guns he has and has also stated he can’t wait for the eventual civil war to happen cause he’s got enough guns and ammo to “take out all these fucking liberals ruining the country.” And I’m sitting in the corner like “so you’re gonna kill me?” It’s shit like that that makes me happy to be a gun owner. And, as a veteran, I fucking HATE I have to say that about my fellow countrymen."

27-4-1-2-1,"I'm not sure if it's the event that OP is referring to, but if anyone is curious, an example of one such event is called The Battle of Blair Mountain, which was a five day conflict between 10,000 coal unionized miners and the local county police/the mining company.Not only did the local government hire private militias to fight the protesting coal miners, the mining company itself hired private aircraft to shoot and drop bombs from above.The conflict only ended after President Warren Harding sent the Army National  Guard to stop the fighting."

28,Jan. 6 committee approves criminal referrals against Trump for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election
28-1,"Co-conspirators too, including John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.* 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c) - Obstruction of an Official Proceeding* 18 U.S.C. § 371 - Conspiracy to Defraud the United States* 18 U.S.C. § 371, 1001 - Conspiracy to Make a False Statement* 18 U.S.C. § 2383 - ""Incite,"" ""Assist"" or ""Aid in Comfort"" an InsurrectionPlus 4 recommendations to House Ethics committee for Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs, and Mo Brooks for refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas.EDIT: Now 5 members and including Kevin McCarthy!"
28-1-1,Glad to see Mark Meadows in that list. He was central to everything:
28-1-1-1,"I’ve been reading a few books on the Trump presidency and he comes off the worst, after trump, in every single none of them. Despite his abhorrent views, he just screams at everyone all the time."
28-1-1-1-1,Any book recommendations?
28-1-1-1-1-1,"The last two I’ve read are *Confidence Man* and *Nightmare Scenario*, the first a more straightforward biography of Trump that starts with his early life, and the second is a deeper dive into the Covid response by his administration. Both were very good, but I think Nightmare Scenario was a little better. Tangentially, I also read *They Want to Kill Americans* which focuses on the domestic terrorism groups that are unified behind Trump such as The Proud Boys and The Oath Keepers. That one is also good, though there is a lot more editorializing in that one, so YMMV."
28-1-1-1-1-1-3,"Right. Think of how many people would still be alive today, if trump had listened to Fauci, and hadn't spent the first months of the pandemic trying to convince people, that it was nothing to worry about. All because it was mainly affecting people in cities where democrats live.  We could have nipped it in the bud, but instead America, with only 4% of the world's population, had 25% of the world's covid deaths under trump."
28-1-1-1-1-1-3-1,You definitely come away from that book realizing how many people died because of a dangerous combination of incompetence and malfeasance. It’s the most infuriating book I’ve read in a very long time.
28-1-1-1-1-1-4,Hidden in Plain Sight was great for background history on how Trump came to power too.
28-1-1-1-1-1-5,"Hi friend. I checked out Nightmare Scenario from my library as soon as I read your comment. I just finished it. A+, explains a lot and also gives credit where credit is due. Pretty unbiased, albeit ugly."
28-1-1-1-1-1-5-1,"Oh that makes me feel good! Glad you read it. I did think it was pretty unbiased, even admitting when Fauci made the wrong call at times. Reading how it all unfolded, I couldn’t help but think of how many people would still be alive if things were done better. It’s infuriating, and it’s just depressing how a pandemic hit us when we were the most ill-equipped from a leadership perspective to deal with it."
28-1-1-1-1-2,There's no need for books.  It's publicly displayed for us how dumb ans insane the guy is.
28-1-1-1-2,He sounds like an absolute ass to work with. That one testimony described him as basically glued to his phone and not even courteous enough to look up at people
28-1-1-2,He most likely brought everyone down with his dumb phone. Lol.
28-1-1-5,Didn't he spearhead the racist shit against Obama when he was in office?

We'll see black sweat dripping off his cheap hairsprayed head onto his thick face makeup one last time. We'll see how incredibly old, pale, gray & feeble he becomes overnight, maybe even with a walker or in a wheelchair. He suddenly becomes a poor old man who was fooled, may even claim mental illness or dementia is to blame for his bad decisions & claim he's too sick to be jailed."

28-4-5-1,The images are all online.  You could print the cards yourself.
28-4-5-1-1,"Better yet, just use [Honest Trump Cards]."
28-4-5-1-1-1,Any chance he's pulling an Elvis and selling pro-Trump and anti-Trump stuff to get the money both ways?
28-4-5-1-1-1-1,"There's no way Trump would approve of anything that showed him even slightly negatively. That's why all his Trump Cards show him physically fit with six pack abs.  He wants to be seen as a virile, sexy man who women lust over and men idolize. Even the reality of him being an overweight, disgusting old man is too negative for him to bear."
28-4-5-3,"They were priced and limited to be just below the amount that needs to be reported.  You could buy 100 of them at $99, leaving you just below the $10,000 limit for the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirement.It was a campaign finance scam and money laundering. Was never about gag gifts."

28-5-1-2,And won't Jordan be chair of the justice committee in January?
28-5-1-2-1,Holy shit talk about the inmates running the asylum
28-5-1-2-1-1,"Jordan was a nominee by McCarthy to serve on the Jan 6th committee too, but rejected by Pelosi."
28-5-1-2-1-1-2,On what grounds? It not like he specifically asked for a pardon for the crimes the committee is tasked with investigating...
28-5-1-2-1-1-2-3,He was a witness.  It's a conflict of interest.
28-5-1-2-2,By referring then to the justice department now I'm hoping that bypasses those kind of shenanigans. Maybe someone with more context can clarify the situation though.
28-5-2,"From AP News: Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs, and Mo Brooks for refusing to comply with lawful subpoenas.Edit: Now they're saying 5 members and including Kevin McCarthy!"
28-5-2-1,"IIRC, some guy filed a lawsuit trying to prevent Perry to run from office but I don't think it got anywhere in timeEdit: ["
28-5-2-1-1,"Yeah he filed it very late. Perry won by a much smaller margin than his last term. His opponent Shamaine Daniels' entire platform was ""I'm not the insurrectionist Scott Perry"" basically."
28-5-3,The members are.* Andy Biggs of AZ* Mo Brooks of AL* Jim Jordan of OH* ~~Kevin McCarthy of CA~~* Scott Perry of PA* and Kevin McCarthy of CA is back on the list!
28-5-3-2,"AP said Scott Perry, not McCarthy.Edit: Well, now AP is saying 5 members, and including both."
28-5-3-2-1,"Corrected... Though in all honesty, the ethics committee should be looking into him too."
28-5-3-2-1-1,"Oh, now AP is saying five members, and we're both right."
28-5-4,"What doesn't make sense to me is why it's only those four. I know they're saying it's because they defied the subpoenas, but if trump is guilty of supporting the insurrection, then soo too are most republican members of Congress. Trump himself is an insurrectionist, and therefore Republicans support for trump after January 6th makes them all guilty. I'm just following their own logic here. If trump is guilty, then so are most Republicans. By not referring all of them, it may actually hurt their case, since it seems to like the law is being applied selectively here. And in the end, each and every person who supported Trump's lawlessness, his coup attempt, deserves to be behind bars. I know Democrats don't have the courage to do this, but in a just world, a world of law and order, it's what would happen."

29-1-1-1-1,"I've heard Trump supporters literally say, ""what's so bad about Putin anyway?"" This coming from a boomer who's father went behind the iron curtain and literally smuggled refugees out from the East Zone. It's like Trump has washed away any semblance of critical thinking these people once might have had."
29-1-1-1-1-1,"If his only source of news is far right media, then he's been hearing for years that Putin isn't so bad, he's Trump's buddy. Add that to the new Q delusion that Putin is destroying bio-labs (including adrenochrome factories, apparently) and you've got a ""white hat"" hero. I'm just waiting for them to start calling for Trump to have Putin as his running mate in 24."
29-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Not to mention he was the strong leader who just wanted what's best for Russia all through the Obama admin.  Fox News used all those Russian propaganda photos of him on a horse and shit to make Obama look ""weak"" for things like riding a bicycle wearing a helmet.

That would be difficult because we all are just too lazy.  But that is the real culprit.  I see this phenomena on both sides.  I could give you a laundry list for both.  It is truly disgusting and is ruining the country.   This place is 50/50 and we MUST learn to be civilized to one another.  There is no other option.  My recommendation is watch and listen to as many viewpoints and different news outlets as possible.  And don't get news from Facebook, Instagram, etc.  All these places care about is revenue.

The disease itself is rabid xenophobia, brought on by decades of relentless right-wing propaganda, politicized evangelism, and perpetual hostility towards public education funding, particularly at the university level.But that doesn't explain where the disease comes from. The disease is a product of wealthy industrialists, manufactured to divide a society against itself so that it's easier to pick our pockets and siphon our wealth; tax cuts for the rich, privatized healthcare, union busting, it's all connected.

Sadly no tRump family member will face conviction or confinement for the myriad of financial and political crimes they’ve  committed.

29-2-5-1-1-1-1,"I'm a life long New York City resident and spent far too much of my life seeing Donnie appear in our local media.  He was a one man mountain of bullshit from the moment he first forced his way into the gossip pages.  Here's a link to another article.  The tl, dr is that Donnie built Trump Tower to get in good with the Manhattan elites, then insulted and lied to the people he wanted to impress.[link]"
29-3,"Before the election he implored Russia, a long time enemy of the USA, to help find dirt on his political opponent.Whilst in power, he was impeached for blackmailing President Zelensky by withholding military aid for Ukraine for dirt on a political opponent's son.Now, he's asking a dictator currently commiting war crimes in Ukraine for help against a political opponent (after praising said dictator for invading Ukraine).I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to think Trump isn't quite as much of a patriot as he says he is."
29-3-1,"In 1987, Trump was invited to Moscow by the Kremlin. When he came back, he announced he was running for office and took out full page ads in the broadsheets using roundabout language to call for the end of US funding of NATO. That's how easy it was for the Russians to manipulate Trump. Since the early 80's he has been inextricably linked with the Russian mafia and their dirty money, via his questionable Russian loans and his laundering of Russian mafia money through his US properties. The man spent his 4 years in office emboldening Putin by undermining Ukraine, then he praised Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, and he has since doubled down on that praise. And now he's asking for Moscow to help him out by dishing dirt on a political opponent."

Genuinely one of the worst people on Earth is the likely Republican, but no, we have to punish the Dems for not doing literally everything ever with a 51/50 majority."
29-3-1-1-1-1-1-3,"God, that last point. I don’t know if it’s trolls or real people on here constantly complaining about “Democrats doing nothing,” but it’s infuriating. That’s the attitude that will get us Republican control again, and a TOTAL LOSS of ANY progress. Democrats can’t agree on how to forgive student debt. You think Republicans will do that AT ALL? Democrats tried to extend free school lunches. You think Republicans will do that AT ALL? Democrats are TRYING to find ways to switch to green energy. You think Republicans will do that AT ALL? You might not LOVE Democrats, but remember Republicans see you as their ENEMY."

29-3-1-1-1-2-2,"> He’ll run. If only to collect campaign donations, but he will run and he could winthats kinda how I feel like a lot of people approached his 2016 canmpaign.  ""It's a grift.

29-3-1-2-2-1,Not to Afghans
29-3-1-3,Goddamn.. Trump was the best investment the Russians have made in a century
29-3-2,">Now, he's asking a dictator currently commiting war crimes in Ukraine for help against a political opponent (after praising said dictator for invading Ukraine).Let's be clear about this. He is asking Russian military intelligence to fabricate a case against Biden, as this benefits Trump and Putin. This is criminal conspiracy as explained in the Mueller Report when Trump was shielded by being POTUS. He no longer has that shield and Garland must start prosecuting these crimes."
29-3-2-1,"in the US, the president is not shielded by any law. The DOJ decided that it was against their policy to indict a sitting president. Mueller simply decided it was not his job to prosecute. Since this has never happened before, there is no precedent and no law so they get away with doing nothing - just like Garland is now. Trump should have been in prison many years ago but he's white and pretends to be wealthy so he goes free."
29-3-4,Also asked China to help him get reelected (according to Bolton).
29-3-4-1,According to Bolton? He said it on national television in front of cameras at the white house.
29-3-4-1-1,"Every news event surrounding Trump is such a complete shit show (of course this is by design; ""flood the zone with shit"") that I couldn't remember if he did that publicly or not.

30,Trump Had More Than 300 Classified Documents at Mar-a-Lago
30-1,The other big piece of news in this article is that Trump reviewed the documents at the end of 2021.  He had knowledge they were classified and refused to turn them over.
30-1-1,"what's news here is that he is reported to have personally gone through everything and reluctantly turned some of it over....and secretly kept other material, which the FBI came to seize.The nature of the material he deliberately withheld could be very interesting."
30-1-1-1,I’m sure this is completely unrelated to the weird leather box he was hiding that they also seized.
30-1-1-1-1,the Epstein motherlode
30-1-1-1-1-1,"Nah that was just the teaser. The Epstein motherload was buried in Ivana's coffin near the Tee of the first hole at Bedminster golf course, NJ, as an insurance policy."
30-1-1-1-1-1-1,"This whole thing kind of weirds me out. I mean, was Ivana a huge golf fan or something?"
30-1-1-1-1-1-1-1,Ivana hated golf. Trump used her corpse to avoid taxes. let that sink in
30-1-1-1-1-1-1-2,"Not in the slightest.What you're suggesting would imply that he cares about her wishes. That would be deeply out of character. --It was a tax dodge. He can reclassify his golf course as a cemetery to reduce his tax rate.--Pure self interest, as is tradition."
30-1-1-1-1-1-1-3,"I've seen speculation that it's so he can classify it as a cemetary, which has some tax loopholes. Not an american, but it seems like something he'd do XD"
30-1-1-2,"what gets me is that he wasn't even smart enough to have someone make copies, then turn over the originals... like...he could have avoided this..still HIGHLY illegal, but he could have kept the feds in the dark..with a fuckin copy machine.  I think that the scary part for me...the next 'Trump' might not be so incompetent. thats my real fear. Someone who does ALL THE SAME SHIT, but is knowledgeable enough not to look foolish while doing it.   that's scary."
30-1-2,"So he intentionally stole them. I swear, ***if he doesn't go to prison for this, rule of law no longer exists.***"
30-2,"Remember if you or I had just one, we’d be sitting in jail while they figured out how to move forward. This entire scenario is the epitome of privilege."
30-2-1,"And not two years later either, inventory is typically done every night for docs. I remember reading about the material the day he left office in his chopper, and just thinking, what the fuck is going on."
30-2-1-1," Because they knew he had it, asked for it back, didn’t get it all back and so they went and got it. The number of chances he’s had with this is unprecedented."
30-2-1-1-1,"Nobody, not even the biggest Trump haters in government, wants to prosecute a former president. It's going to suck for them. They'd rather bend over backwards a hundred ways to let him out of this jam, because prosecuting him is going to be a shitty, thankless task and a historic media circus. But Trump kept defying them, making prosecution necessary. At least that's how I feel. Who knows how this is all going to play out?"
30-2-1-1-1-1,"Not only that but people keep ignoring the fact that TRUMP disclosed the FBI search and seizure. The FBI and the AG only announced it in response to his bullshit.It is entirely possible that the FBI wanted complete secrecy in the matter, but he took away any privacy or top cover he might have otherwise received.Do things leak? Yeah. Could it have been explained away? Undoubtedly. Trump screwed himself again because he can’t shut up and not play the victim card.THEN, he loudly and publicly attacked the FBI and the AG which led to his moronic acolytes literally throwing themselves against the FBI and being killed.If I were the AG and the FBI, I’d be well past any kind of deference or respect toward the moron and I’d make damn sure he got the maximum sentence for all of it."
30-2-1-1-1-1-1,"If it comes out he was selling nuclear secrets, that's a possible death sentence.Penalty: Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death,[4] or not less than five years' imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States.[5]"
30-2-1-1-1-2,Then as far as I’m concerned the entire government needs to be ran out of town and new blood with actual spines brought in. Fuck the doj flukies for wanting easy pay checks and a pension when they retire. This is literally why there are 3 branches of government. To keep each other in “checks and balances”. It’s literally taught in every civics class in the USA. I know it’s a pipe dream to even think the government will do it’s duty but Atleast to this point we had the illusion of justice. I’m not sure what we got. That said you are completely right about everything you said.
30-2-1-1-1-2-1,"I'll play Devils advocate here. The DOJ and the FBI look at the Trump cult every day. They are begging for violence and increasingly showing that they are willing to fight and die for their beliefs. The ramifications for this will be staggering. It won't just be against the FBI. You or I could be a target. There is no historical precedent for this. When they pull the trigger, things will change immediately. With so much at stake, and knowing it will be a major historical event, you would want to: desperately try to avoid this in any way possible, and make sure you are perfect in execution when you finally have to commit."
30-2-1-1-1-2-1-1,"I’m just thankful maga has been burning their military bridge. I believe that the excessive military funding in this country pretty much ensures that this cult won’t reach past domestic terrorism levels of threat, and with their IQ I’m pretty confident in our ability to detect and stop attacks. One major attack would be enough to turn the country solidly against them, and if a few thousand citizens die to stop this plague, this country will still come out ahead. How many hundreds of thousands are already dead due to lack of reasonable governing?"
30-2-2,"Don't you remember when the FBI searched Obama's house in Chicago in the summer of 2017 to retrieve all those classified documents he took from the White House?  Oh yeah, of course that never happened, and if it had, the GOP would've called for Obama's immediate execution."
30-2-2-1,"And yet I've read the argument that ""Obama stole millions of classified documents when he left office and no one raided his house!""There is no reasoning with truly depraved and lost people. They need to all go drink some Flavor-Aide and complete the cult circle of life so they stop messing up the world for everyone else. The terrifying part is that this isn't like 5% of Americans, it's like 40%. Obama was one of the most scandal free presidents to ever serve, but you'd never know it listening to the racist portion of America, most Republicans/Conservatives. They have literally no other reason to hate him other than his skin tone."
30-2-2-1-1,"Nah, they *also* hate Obama because he's smart and well spoken, well educated, and (in their eyes) extremely left wing."
30-2-2-1-3,"He stole 3 MILLION DOCUMENTS! And did go and ruin the ACA with his Obamacare. Everyone knows we would have been better off just using Romney's plan, but Obama just wouldn't comprise.giant /s, that really shouldn't be necessary. But if someone brings up the crazy Obama document thing, ask them why the president after him didn't do anything about it, or even mention it until now. Then imply that Obama and Trump are secretly working together and had been since Trump first started his birth certificate madness, because they wanted to be able to cover up their crimes by making Americans hate each other. These people love feeling like they figured out everything and know someone nobody else knows (usually from a Facebook post, somehow) and somehow have an easier time believing it than actual facts."
30-2-4,"Yep, and this POS is out playing golf and yucking it up like nothing happened. Absolute bullshit, if true, and the evidence is there, lock him the fuck up. If he somehow walks on a BS technicality… People need to get mad, damn mad."
30-2-5,They got him dead to rights on this.Why he isn't being immediately arrested for obvious crimes here and put on trial is baffling. Absolutely baffling.
30-3,Three hundred too many. He was allowed to have zero top secret documents in the unlocked basement of his pool house.
30-3-1,Where who knows how many foreign agents are wandering around.
30-3-1-1,"I’m just going to leave this story from 2019 here:“She was found carrying four cellphones, a laptop, a hard drive and a thumb drive, but no swimsuit. After a preliminary forensic investigation, the thumb drive was found to contain ""malicious malware,"" according to the affidavit.”"

30-3-1-1-2-3,"God, I hope that the ""deep state"" used Trump as a honeypot for 4 years, handing him fake classified documents that he handed over to Putin and the Saudis and everyone else in the world."
30-3-1-2,"I’m sure this is nothing> While much of the footage showed hours of club employees walking through the busy corridor, some of it raised concerns for investigators, according to people familiar with the matter. It revealed people moving boxes in and out, and in some cases, appearing to change the containers some documents were held in."
30-3-2,"All the documents generated by the executive belong to the national archive. None of them, classified or not, belong to Trump."
30-3-2-1,"But you see Trump declassified them and then he claimed he owned them. It was a standing order that nobody heard, nobody knows about, but was definitely said and is totally above board. Kash on Hannity tomorrow"
30-3-2-1-1,"Telepathic declassification, if you will."
30-4,Trumps waited his whole life for the ultimate grift. Access to all the secrets the US gov has on everything from nukes to intelligence on foreign adverseries and friends. This is the jackpot for grifters like Trump. Access to a tresure trove with endless dollars signs selling this info to whomever.
30-4-1,"What's insane to me is that this isnt being acted on until about 2 years later, what the fuck. I forget to sign in a document at end of the day and someone knows, what is going on here?"
30-4-1-1,"In the federal government's defense they HAVE been trying to get them back all this time. The National Archives anyways. And at least one occasion if not more Trumps people have said 'we've returned them all.' for it to be discovered that was obviously not the case. They knew how many copies were made, where they should be etc but Trump was well known throughout his tenure to just randomly destroy documents. He's tear them up, flush them down toilets, put them in wrong locations....so it's not surprising that they had to finally get a warrant to actually look for the documents he'd 'misplaced'."
30-4-1-1-1,Trump also ate documents to conceal them.  Allegedly. 
30-4-1-1-1-1,What a stupid fuckin' asshole!

30-4-1-1-1-1-2,"Hey, he eventually learned that [you can actually put them directly in the toilet without eating them first.]"
30-4-1-1-1-2,The fact the dumbass tried to flush or eat documents to conceal them in a house that has 28 fireplaces proves he isn't the smartest nor fit for the office.
30-4-2,"The [Saudi Prince transferred **$4 billion** into the private equity firms of Kushner and Mnuchin last year] after overruling his own government's investment board.Which of the stolen top secret documents did Trump give the Saudi access to for that deal, and what was his cut?"
30-4-2-1,Saudi has been absolutely **desperate** for nuclear tech in recent years. It has been their number one desire.
30-4-2-2,"Let's hope it was a pay for info advance, done early and randomly, months later when the dust settles the info comes. But we got him before that.Trump fucked the FBI. I'm betting they had a team all over his orange ass the second he left office. They had to act now, before the deal went down, hence, the two years"
30-4-3,Trump's Razor. The most lucrative explanation is always the best
30-4-3-1,"If your reaction is ""this is a joke, right?"", it isn't."
30-4-3-1-1,But that's not really accurate.  Trump is a terrible businessman.

30-4-3-3,MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I hate the literal definition of trump not jibing with the pejorative reality he created. HE DID THAT.  And more than anything history needs to mark this charlatan carnie grifting asshole and his name for all forward facing time.

30-5-1-2-1-1,"Yep, it’s everywhere. I just got a perma-ban on /r/moderatepolitics because I said the Supreme Court Justices are extremists.  The brainwashing and gaslighting is everywhere."
30-5-1-2-1-1-1,"The problem with a sub like r/ModeratePolitics is that the world isn’t always in a state of equilibrium, so trying to force everything to be “moderate” when things are in fact “extremely fucked” just plays into the hands of the extremists. It basically treats the Overton Window as a relative marker of stability and lets us pretend things are always ok while ignoring prominent and immediate threats.Might as well call it NCN (Neville Chamberlain News)."
31,House committee receives Donald Trump's federal tax returns from IRS
31-1,">In September 2016, Donald J. Trump stood on the debate stage as a presidential candidate and addressed a question that had dogged him on the campaign trail: When would he release his tax return?    “I’m under a routine audit, and it’ll be released,” Mr. Trump said. “And as soon as the audit is finished, it will be released.”   "
31-1-1,So what does he say now?  That he's still under audit?  How does he answer this question?
31-1-1-2,He recently said at a rally that he had already provided his tax returns.  So I guess he was just speaking proactively?
31-1-1-2-1,That is a way I guess.  Provided to whom though?
31-1-1-2-1-1,"An older set of his returns were released a while ago. They too showed that he was broke, iirc"
31-1-1-2-1-1-1,"Not just broke, they showed he lost the most money of ANYONE IN THE ENTIRE US for the time period they covered.Literally the biggest loser ever."
31-1-1-3,"""The forms were under audit before I was elected. The audit is now complete, but now, if I released them, it would be a witch hunt, so I can't do it. I'd love to, but I can't.""Not that that makes sense. If there's nothing to hide, Democrats can't air dirty laundry. But don't expect Trump's followers to think that far."
31-1-1-3-1,"For as many witch hunts that Trump has been involved in, I'm pretty sure he is a witch."
31-1-1-4,"Didn’t someone from the IRS said back then that it doesn’t matter whether they were being audited, that he could still release them?"
31-1-2,"If we had serious journalists here, they would push back on his bullshit during interviews and press him for answers about this (and many other) matter(s)"
31-1-2-1,Trump and his team just stop inviting any news group that asks hard questions.
31-1-2-1-1,"So if everyone does, there will be no one left to give him any publicity"
31-1-2-1-1-3,"Unfortunately, he seems to have a willing legion of media sycophants..."
31-1-2-1-3,You have him mixed up with Biden.  However a president does not have to show their tax returns.  But the house can and did file to get a copy of them. But you need to understand the libs are setting the precedent that any other president can do the same to them. And I can't wait till they go after Joe Biden and Hunter Biden
31-1-2-1-3-1,"Every recent D presidential candidate did release their returns. So, what precedent, exactly, is being set?Also, Biden, the president, didn't request Trumps returns,  so your ""any other president can do the same to them"" doesn't make sense.Also, Hunter Biden isn't a political figure, so why do you care about him? Trump misrepresenting his finances or getting money from foreign countries could alter his presidential decision making abilities. Hunter is just a guy.And if you argue that he's family of Joe, I encourage you to Google Ginny Thomas, wife of a SCOTUS justice."
31-1-2-1-3-1-1,"There is no legal requirement of any kind that presidential candidates release tax returns from any year. Indeed, there is a strict, strong constitutional right to privacy for all tax returns. Thus, tax returns can be released by an individual taxpayer, but cannot released by the IRS to the public. However, one Senator has proposed legislation requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns."
31-1-2-1-3-3,What are you even talking about? Just go to whitehouse.gov to view Biden’s and go after him…
31-1-2-1-4,"When is Joe Biden ever asked hard questions? Lmao, Trump never hid the fact the tax system is broken and he uses it to his advantage and it’ll never change because both sides are being funded by people who abuse it. Difference is no other politician would dare admit that."
31-1-2-1-4-1,"> And uses it to his advantage. You're talking about tax fraud there, friend. It's not just bending the rules, it's smashing them into pieces and then using his influence to obfuscate and hide the truth. Fact is, it looks like Trump is the first president of the United States to repeatedly commit crimes while in office. If Biden or any other president / government official did the same, I'd expect the law to be upheld and for them to recieve exactly the same treatment. Trump has been pissing on you all for years, and by this point you're too blinded by political vitriol to notice it's not rain."
31-1-2-3,"""Pushing back on his bullshit"" doesn't get you anywhere with trump.  It just causes him to spew more bullshit."
31-1-3,Is there any proof of audit that comes with tax returns from the IRS? I doubt it but it would be funny if there was no indication of audit.
31-1-5,And the answer is....REDACTED.
31-2,"> “No Congress has ever wielded its legislative powers to demand a President’s tax returns,” Trump argued to the Supreme Court, as he warned of the “far-reaching implications” implications of the DC Circuit’s ruling.That’s because no Congress has ever *had* to wield its powers in such a way. As for the implications, I hope they *are* far-reaching. Despite Trump’s best efforts, the United States is still a democracy, not a dictatorship."
31-2-1,"Because every candidate released them voluntarily so we never had to make a law requiring it. He's the reason you see ""no horses on hospital premises"" signs."
31-2-1-3,"If it weren't for my horse, I wouldn't have spent that year in college."
31-2-2,"I loathe Trump. He's a huge piece of shit. That said, if he needs to be compelled by the courts to share his returns then Im not sure the issue is with him. The expectation should be that those who are running for office should be required to make this sort of stuff public to the voters. Trump is an ass but on the bright side he seems to be exposing something that should be required instead of being a ""gentlemen's agreement"" that tax returns have been over the last half century."
31-2-2-1,"Ultimately all of this is on the voters for allowing it. That's how the Constitution set it up. Honestly, I'm not sure how great it's working out."
31-2-4,He always has a way with words doesn’t he. He will accuse people of things he’s done. He will call for punishment on things that fit his crimes. It would be funny if he wasn’t so corrupt and criminally incapable of doing anything right.
31-3,Time to research all those shell companies
31-3-1,"I don't think it'll be hard to track them down, they tried to avoid prosecution in New York by making a new company in another state called the Trump Corporation II. Surely, no one will ever see through _that_ shell game in a shell game. I mean, who's going to pore over hundreds of incorporation papers and cross-reference names and dates and compare signatures?"
31-3-1-2,"The former Presidents own lawyer started two companies to pay off a Porn Star and a former Playboy Bunny and those were figured out very quickly. Essential Consultants LLC, one of the two companies that Michael Cohen created, took in $4.4 million, $500,000 of that money was from Russian Oligarch Viktor Veklesberg. When Trump nutters tell you there was no Russian collusion, ask them if they remember this fact."
32,Pro-Trump FBI protest cancelled after not one demonstrator showed up
32-1,News outlets have to stop reporting on this like Trump would. They make it sound like tens of thousands of people are out there. Every video I've seen up to now has 5 or 10 people. To call these rallies is absurd.
32-1-1,They should just call them what they are: Loitering.
32-1-1-1,A Loitering of Morons.
32-1-1-1-2,I can only hear that in John Malkovich 's voice.
32-1-1-1-2-1,I don’t know why but that absolutely works for me too now.
32-1-1-1-2-3,Trump's not here representing Hardbodies.
32-1-1-1-2-3-1,He's just a good Samaritan

32-1-1-1-5-3,A Conspiracy of Ravens
32-1-1-2,"Thats not what they are.Theyre incitations for terrorism.Jan 6 happened identically.  It was a ""protest"" which was a guise for a staged amd coordinated terrorist attack on the US Capitol."
32-1-1-2-1,The language and rhetoric is the same as well.There painting what the FBI did as illegal and and the raid on trump as politically motivated.While also doing just enough room to deny they are trying to invite violence.
32-1-2,Just meetups really.  I could get more people to meet up to learn to draw pictures of puppies I bet.
32-1-2-2,"It’s hypothetical, yet I’m already interested. You have experience drawing puppies? How well can you teach drawing of puppies?"
32-1-2-2-1,"Yeah, like is this a workshop or a series of classes? Will there be puppies live modeling or is this just a demonstration?"
32-1-2-2-1-1,"If it’s live modeling, do we get new puppies to draw every week?"
32-1-2-2-1-1-1,and can we pet them after?
32-1-2-2-1-1-1-1,Or during? I have bad eyes and shaky hands but I can absolutely keep a puppy calm for others to draw.
32-1-2-3,I want to bring my puppy so he can be drawn.
32-1-2-3-3,Why are we drawing the puppies instead of playing with them?
32-1-2-3-3-1,"Hey, this is a puppy-art-rally thing. There's gonna be playtime, without a doubt"
32-1-3,I looked up the phoenix fbi protest expecting to see an army. It was a handful of out of shape people with big and tall gear on.
32-1-3-2,"Over on r/conservative “there’s a guy with a beard and confederate flag, clearly that has to be a plant they placed there to stir shit up, couldn’t be one of our guys.”The funny thing is the poster got a few tens downvoted for that one, then he followed up with “I see we’re still being brigaded.”"
32-1-5,I miss the days when he would leave his supporters out in the cold to freeze.
32-1-5-1,winter is coming
32-2,"This may seem like a dumb question, but if nobody showed up, who cancelled it?"
32-2-1,"I am cancelling my orgy with the Maxim swimsuit edition models! This makes it a real event, despite none of the models showing up to my dirty apartment."
32-2-1-1,I’m canceling my private jet trip to Fiji right now
32-2-1-1-2,Cancelling my intergalactic tour as we speak.
32-2-1-2,Maybe if you cleaned your fucking apartment they'd show up
32-2-1-3,"Crap… just had to cancel my hook-up with Jason Momoa. I swear it was real… if he says he has no idea who I am, that’s just how he and I joke around. Such a kidder."
32-2-5,Some rabble-rouser with no balls who wanted to sit back and watch other people be useful idiots...

32-3-1-1-1,What is Jinnoside? Is that an extension of the ESPN act? Is the Gazpacho being chilled by the Jewish space laser?
32-3-1-1-1-1,"No, worse. The Jewish space lasers are making the gazpacho hot and we can’t have that"
32-3-1-1-1-1-1,"Quick, get the gazpacho into a peach tree dish. Should cool it down."
32-3-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Fuck, the peach tree dish is cooled by solar power and its night time."
32-3-1-1-1-1-3,Piping hot gazpacho soup.
32-3-1-1-1-1-3-2,"Great, now it's just pasghetti sauce!"
32-3-1-1-1-3,nah they keep it in the walk-in cooler right next to the trans aborted antifas.
32-3-2,">**The unwitting: The Trump supporters used by Russia**>A Donald Trump supporter who unwittingly helped a Kremlin-linked operation to meddle in American politics says he only learned of his part in the Russian plot when the FBI showed up at his doorstep months later.>Harry Miller was paid as much as $1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016.>The stunt was part of an elaborate scheme run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St Petersburg, Russia with links to the Kremlin, that was designed to undermine the American political system, according to a new federal indictment. The agency and thirteen Russian nationals associated with it were named in the indictment, which was made public by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office on Friday."
32-3-2-1,Friendly reminder Mueller very clearly found evidence of Russian collusion.And very clearly said if not for Trump and co obstructing would have found more evidence.
32-3-2-1-1,I believe that report says Trump could be charged but because he was president they could not.
32-3-2-1-1-3,"This is false. He recommendedEnded they charge TrumpBut also said that was the extent of the special counsel’s power legally, a recommendation to congressRepublicans were like wait a minute, that’s us! Yeah we’re good"

But no clue, ok buddy."
32-3-2-2-1,>you build up a rapportThat is literal textbook language in spycraft for how you develop an asset.
32-3-2-2-1-1,Its just so clear and the dude didn't have a single clue? How many clues does he need to equal one clue?

32-3-2-2-4-1,Wait til the rubes finally realize that their king has no loyalty to the US. Wait til they realize he’s the opposite of law and order.   They would’ve realized this a while ago if Fox News wasn’t an anti democracy propaganda machine.
32-3-2-2-4-1-2,They've been convinced to not have loyalty to the US so they don't really care. They want something like Hungary here. They aren't particularly fond of democracy.
32-3-2-3,Didn't Marge do something very similar recently? She put a jan 6 criminal in a cage onstage and prayed to him or something?
32-3-2-3-2,While saying just a few days later she cannot be convinced Jan 6 wasn't an Antifa attack.Don't believe for a moment this was out of stupidity.
32-3-2-3-2-1,"> Don't believe for a moment this was out of stupidity.My man.So many people are blowing her off like shes some sort of idiot, but the truth is she is playing anyone who listens like a fiddle. She says something that should otherwise be completely disregarded as jibberish,  but then Huff Post/CNN/MSNBC runs a story about how awful she is and how outrageous the remarks were. Same goes for all of the far right nutbags like Gym Jordan, Ted Cruz, Matt Geatz etc and they know the media outlet will amplify their message on left and right media.If we can just get media to ignore them we would be much better off. However, we didnt learn our lesson with trump so I hold out little hope."
32-3-4,I'm going to apologize right now because I'm going to be stealing this.
32-3-4-2,"Just a suggestion, but try this:>The organizers would have been there, but their flight from Russia got canceled.  Sadly, these people live within 25 miles of where they were born and have never left.  A visa is a credit card to them."
32-3-4-2-4,What’s wrong with living within 25 miles of where you were born?
32-3-4-2-4-1,Its the never left part.
32-3-4-2-4-1-1,And the pretending to know how the whole world operates when you've only experienced a tiny sliver.
32-3-4-2-4-1-1-1,So basically what you’re saying is you aren’t allowed to have an opinion if you still live close to where you were born.Cool.
32-3-5,"Nevermind that, it was probably too hot. Their scooters would most likely overheat as they drove around the lot."
32-3-5-1,As if Trump would allow his filthy unwashed fanatics on his property.  They will all be outside the gates foaming at the mouth for a glimpse inside of Trumps gilded cage.
32-4,I heard that they are moving from in person protests to boycotting the midterm elections.  I honestly don’t blame them.  Taking a principled stand like that will do much more to elevate their cause and credibility than the ineffective gun and flag waving.
32-4-1,"Yeah I agree. Republicans boycotting midterms is, and I'm gonna hate saying this, an excellent way of ""owning the libs""."
32-4-1-1,I literally feel like crying right now because the thought of this is triggering me so bad
32-4-1-1-1,Sprinting/sobbing to my safe space as I'm typing this.

32-4-1-1-3,"Don't worry guys, if Jon Oliver and my CRT classes have taught me anything it's that boycotting the midterms is WAY too hardcore and brave for them to pull it off. The right will surely vote in record numbers this year, so everyone rest easy!"
32-4-1-1-3-2,Are you insinuating the conservatives are too cowardly to boycott the midterms? I hear *real* men aren’t too afraid to stay home on Election Day.

32-4-1-4,The dead dumb shit last week in the Ohio FBI attack didn't even vote in 2020.
32-4-1-4-2,A lot of the Jan 6 people didn't vote either. What the hell are they even protesting for?!?
32-4-1-4-2-1,I think they’re just in it for the violence.

32-4-1-4-2-2-1,That's the crazy part I don't understand. It's just the weirdest disconnect.
32-4-1-4-2-2-1-1,"100% of elections are rigged against those who don’t vote, lol."
32-4-2,It is the smartest thing they could do. The less they vote the more it will show they are serious.
32-4-2-1,"Trump said the dirty Dems already rigged the midterms and you decide to waste your time and vote in them, all you're doing is giving the dems your personal information so they can have the FBI raid your home and arrest you. Trump would never lie. Be safe."
32-4-2-1-1,"True enough. Trump is really just super concerned about keeping the deep state going after his people. He probably can't sleep at night, concerned about persecution of even one of his followers."
32-4-4,"I don't know if we should be discussing this on a public forum.  If the MAGA cyber warriors find out, they'll get more people to boycott the mid-terms, and that'll extra-own the libs."
32-4-4-1,That’s a good point.  We know how good they are at doing their own research. They will definitely find this.
32-4-4-1-1,Should hide it amongst the alternative “truths” on Facebook.

33,Biden vows to crack down on colleges 'jacking up costs' and causing student debt to spiral after Trump 'looked the other way'
33-1,"When I went to school, they said it was a guaranteed rate for the next four years. They promised our tuition wouldn’t go up. Then as a sophomore it went up and they told us to go fuck ourselves."
33-1-2,"I don't like that were always talking about just ""tuition,"" because a huge portion of student debt is really due to other fees associated with attending college. I feel like even if legislation is passed to cap tuition, they'll just keep raising the fees"
33-1-2-1,On campus housing and dining options prices skyrocket. Oh by the way we also mandate that freshmen live on campus and have the basic meal plan.
33-1-2-1-1,"my university mandated all freshmen take the second largest dining plan.and the dining points didn't roll over across semesters.so every semester, around finals week, you'd see freshmen carrying full flats of 24 gatorade or whatever they could spend bulk points on, it was ridiculous."
33-1-2-1-1-1,"Holy shit.So were dining points basically buy-at-volume store and canteen credit? They’re not really a thing in the UK (or at least not the campus I was on) so it’s not really a familiar concept.Edit: [okay it does exist here], a whole 10% for effectively direct debiting onto a prepay card weekly, “_bargain_”I was expecting like, pay £40 and get £60 to spend"
33-1-2-1-1-1-1,"At my school it was more like pay $500 and get $300 to spend, and everything you could spend it on was inflated in price too."
33-1-2-1-1-1-1-2,The company store
33-1-2-1-1-1-2,"essentially, yes. my university would charge a lump sum at the beginning, and your ""dining point balance"" would hold a semester's worth of points to spend.and then they'd pocket the remainder at the end of each semester lmaothey also claimed there was a 50% discount when you used dining points, but each point cost $2 so it was meaningless"
33-1-2-1-1-1-2-1,"Oh wow, and of course university food is overpriced too"
33-1-2-1-1-1-4,"Usually at uni in the US there are three options, one which is basically a buffet, one of which is basically unhealthy convenience store junk, and the last which is meals done a la carte. The first will quite often be a different currency than the last two (at my college there were three totally different types: swipes, dollars, and branded cash) and there will be a transfer rate between them where you *always* lose money.So over the course of the semester you use these to buy meals, and quite often they're not good so you start eating out or just getting stuff from the store to keep in your fridge. Then the last week before everyone goes home people just cash all their remaining swipes and dollars for junk food because otherwise they go away. I remember my girlfriend in college knew I liked gummy worms so she bought like a small human worth of them and gave them to me since she didn't know what else to spend them on."
33-1-2-1-1-1-4-1,"I know at my school students could order cakes and extra large comically sized pizzas (intended for birthdays and parties).At the end of the year, all the freshman were buying huge cakes and pizzas and having them delivered to random strangers just to spend the remaining points. Man, what a scam that shit is"
33-1-2-1-1-3,Did we go to the same college? Or are all colleges shit like this?
33-1-2-1-1-3-1,The latter
33-1-2-1-1-4,"My undergrad allowed us to rollover until the end of the year but that was it. My last couple weeks as a freshman I ate at the most expensive dining halls every single day, got two thermoses from the cafes, and went to the weekend waffle bar as much as I could. I think I had nearly $2000 unused because I was so stressed that year I constantly forgot to eat"
33-1-2-1-1-5,"We had something similar.  On top of what you described, there were a few times when I just sat there at the cafeteria and had them scan the next 20 people in line using my card."
33-1-2-1-2,Off campus housing in college towns is mostly run by slumlords and giant corporate apartment complexes. It's not any cheaper
33-1-2-1-2-1,"Live in Denton, can confirm"
33-1-2-1-2-1-1,"Oof, ain't that the fucking truth. Garbage ass landlords can't fuckin fix anything *and* increase the rentSource: also live in Denton"
33-1-2-1-2-1-1-2,Wild. I wonder if that mostly applies to complexes that are marketed toward students. My rent has only gone up twice in 8 years and that’s only because I moved into a larger unit.Also maintenance crew is very quick to solve issues.
33-1-2-1-2-1-2,"UNT can go to hell. They made a million dollars in parking fines to ""fix the street lights"" years ago. More then UT and A&M. I know they are Mean for their Green but, damn. They own half the town basically on top of TWU being there it's crowded and overpriced.Now Denton wants to talk about how unaffordable it is when most of us have been predicting this for years."
33-1-2-1-2-1-3,"Not sure how Denton was but San Marcos seemed pretty reasonable.  My last semester though I wasnt going full time so I met the criteria for ""government subsidized"" apartments which were pretty nice.  I think my rent topped out at $675 and it was the biggest/nicest place I had ever stayed at.  Now I live in an old ass house smaller than that apartment in southern CO with no AC (ive measured 93 inside the house during summer) for $900/mo.  I have the added benefit of homeless/transients starting fires across the street as well which is pretty cool (not)."
33-1-2-1-2-1-4,Greater DFW ain’t much better lol. Renting a 1b1ba apartment in McKinney for double what my mortgage was a few counties west of here.
33-1-2-1-2-5,"Mostly, it's best to rent a room from a regular individual that either lives in the property or did prior and now rents it out . All my best rooms during college were that situation. All my worst were obviously people that rented out multiple properties specifically to students. Awful."
33-1-2-1-2-5-1,"Yeah. College students should be very cautious of this. Apartment complexes in college towns know that most of their renters are new to living on their own and dealing with landlords so they'll cut corners or do other shady things. I remember when I got my security deposit back there was an ""adding error"" $100 in their favor. Just always be watching out and keep receipts for everything."
33-1-2-1-2-5-1-2,"TBH we need some form of ""know your rights"" for new college students.  That stuff is so illegal, and in most states is a slamdunk to get treble damages... but students usually don't know that."
33-1-2-1-3,"This is exactly what is happening with the SUNY system in NY. In state tuition was capped around $3,500 when I went, but housing and meal plans (which were required if you lived in a non cooking dorm) came out to around $12,000 a year and you were only allowed to be onsite for like ~8 months a year. That’s like $1500 for rent and food."
33-1-2-1-3-1,The thing that killed me is some colleges actually kick students out of the on-campus housing during summer or over Christmas break.My exgf had 2 classmates that had to stay with her for 2 weeks because they *came from fucking france* and can't just fly home for the 2 week Christmas break but the campus locked down basically making them homeless.
33-1-2-1-3-1-2,"This is a very common issue for international students that's getting worse as smaller schools try to attract more international students (higher tuition) but don't have the resources to actually accomodate their needs. Even worse, many are getting lax on American academia norms (verified transcripts, English proficiency, understanding of plagiarism) and letting in students they probably shouldn't which sucks up so many other resources trying to get them to be successful."
33-1-2-2,"Parking fee, technology fee, environmental fee, just because we can fee…"
33-1-2-2-3,"We have a ""special institutional fee"" which is way of increasing tuition without calling it tuition so the state lottery sponsored scholarship won't have to pay for it."
33-1-4,This happened to me too! We ousted the President in response.
33-1-4-1,Which college...?
33-1-4-2,Did tuition go back down?
33-1-4-2-1,Not op but I think we can all assume it did not.
33-1-4-2-1-1,The university board 100% scapegoated the president
33-2,"Its pretty crazy that the US News college rankings and others could actually really quickly reduce nationwide tuition costs by just weighting it more heavily in their rankings. Universities fight tooth and nail for every single factor that goes into those rankings, often in ways that are expensive, and sadly tuition is basically a non-factor in them. The US schools in the top 15 charge around $60k tuition, which is absolutely nuts. Punish their ranking for that and the universities will actually work to make things cheaper.Edit: for those curious on ranking factors, you can check the US News criteria  [here]. Tuition is literally not a factor."
33-2-4,"I go to number 14 on that list, tuition when i was a freshman was 60k and has gone up each year I’ve been. Around 85k now."
33-2-5,"Especially when you consider their endowments. Yale has a endowment of $43 billion, $3.5 million per student, and still charges a $62 thousand tuition! $80K including room and board.Yale could easily go zero tuition and still grow their endowment. Their endowment grew by 10% per year the last 20 years, so they’re making $350K per student per year just from investments.Plus, the first top school with a $0 price tag would instantly stand above the rest. NYU Med School went from rank 27 back in 2010 to rank 2 today due to an admissions boom after going tuition free."
33-2-5-2,"Yale has expensive numbers on paper, but what students actually pay is pretty minimal. Students from middle and lower class families pay next to nothing."
33-2-5-2-1,"I wish it was so! Unfortunately, 46 percent of Yale students get zero financial aid. But happily that fraction continues to decrease. Perhaps one day all such schools will make it so that there are zero costs. Here’s to hoping my friend!"
33-2-5-2-1-1,"Maybe only about half of Yale students get financial aid, but 45% of their students come from the top 5% of income earning families. The median income for a student's family is over $192k each year. Seriously, the cost of Yale has basically no relevance when it comes to talking about changes that need to be made to our country's academic institutions."
33-2-5-2-1-1-1,"Agreed, you are completely correct this particular school isn’t the biggest problem, just picked one with a huge endowment on wikipedia to run some numbers on haha. Still, I think OP’s point that tuition should be weighted heavily in rankings is a good one, encouraging schools with large endowments to lower costs and highlight schools that offer more competitive rates."
33-2-5-3,Why should everyone go for free when half of them come from families that absolutely do not struggle financially?The other 50% receive need-based financial aid that is currently among the most generous in the country.
33-2-5-3-1,"I don’t think anyone should pay for education, at any level Pre-K to University. I got a degree in Europe where everyone paid a very small affordable fee, what you’d pay for text books in most American schools. Yes, they could charge a special fee if you’re rich I suppose, but you could say that for any good/service. A school with $43 billion, more than the GDP of entire states, doesn’t need to charge students anything in my opinion. More generally I think people shouldn’t have to pay to get educated (other than paying taxes, which should be greater for the rich)."
33-3,"My wife finished a PharmD this year. When she started it was $60k a year. By the final year it was $70k. They didn’t even have a coffee shop on campus ffs.During the pandemic they unsurprisingly carried on charging them the same amount, even though they weren’t on campus and when my wife asked for a breakdown of where the money was going, they just gave her the runaround and then eventually refused to give her the information.The whole thing is a fucking joke."
33-3-3,"They preinvest tuition for future projects and don't think they should be on the hook when their cash cow ""guarantee"" takes a hit. All the tuition money forecast for 2019-2022 was already prespent in like, 2015."
33-3-3-1,"Not great, but that seems a lot more responsible or sane  than I would have thought. I'm trying to understand exactly what, practically, a $60,000 per student tuition would be paying for...?  In addition to the various other fees, possibly sports income, advertising, alumni funding, donations, government grants, research program payouts, and other income...?This seems like money laundering or some other institutiinal corruption to me, more than being a bit irresponsible.I get that there are some, especially science and engineering, programs that can be expensive. But even still."
33-3-3-1-1,"That's what I want to know. I went to a university wth 50,000 students. If each kid pays $8,000/year (this was 10 years ago at an affordable school) isn't that $400 million a year? I want to see a budget."
33-3-3-1-1-1,I went to NCSU in North Carolina. They sent out a survey asking us if we all agreed to spend $250 million on a new student center. It was overwhelmingly NO. They sent out an email basically saying they had already decided to spend it anyways and this was simply a courtesy to ask us. Ridiculous.
33-3-5,"> My wife finished a PharmD this year. When she started it was $60k a year. By the final year it was $70k. They didn’t even have a coffee shop on campus ffs.But all the ~~admin staff~~ administrators, and the CEO running the school like a business, and all the football coaches, and the amazing sports arenas - which all cost good money - those are an important part of **education**, innit? /s"
33-3-5-2,"I think you mean *administrators* -  admin staff are essential, and there’s never enough of them."
33-3-5-2-1,fixed

33-4-2,"In less than 2 years, Biden has made progress on nearly every progressive priority (except weed legalization, immigration reform and prison reform/police reform).. his constructive half measures are meant to make it palatable for moderates, shifting the overton window to the left.. If we elect a truly progressive president the groundwork has already been laid.. maybe we don't have time for half measures in some areas, but with such a fucked up electoral system and narrow control of Congress, what he's done is highly praise worthy"
33-4-2-1,"Biden was one of my last choices in the primary to be honest.Be after the last month, it's hard to imagine anyone in all of politics doing as much, nevermind *more*, than he has done on such a thin congressional margin."
33-4-2-1-1,"Sometimes it’s good to be reminded that politics is a skill and being a “career politician” isn’t always a bad thing. I’m right there with you, I wasn’t happy when he won the nomination, but the man knows wtf he’s doing. That alone is a huge upgrade over the previous administration…"
33-4-2-1-1-1,"I also voted against trump. I'm still mad about the Marijuana classification, but holy moly is it nice to have a steady hand back on the wheel.His biggest scandals are trump lmao."
33-4-2-1-1-3,That’s why I think term limits are silly. In no other job would you force somebody to leave because they got good at it. I like competence.
33-4-2-1-1-3-1,"Agreed! Something I would consider, though, is maybe having an age limit? I feel weird having decisions be made by people who won’t see the consequences. Like, once you hit retirement age your name can never go on a ballot again.Idk, I’m just riffing, man"
33-4-2-1-4,"On the other hand, it's unlikely that the congressional makeup would be the same if another candidate won the primary. Bernie might have energized left wing voters and right wing voters alike to vote and vote down the ballot.Edit: I'm not saying right wingers would vote for Bernie"
33-4-2-1-4-2,How would he have gone about doing that?
33-4-2-1-4-2-1,1. Mobilize half of Reddit2. ???3. Profit
33-4-2-1-4-2-1-1,We did it Reddit!
33-4-2-1-5,That's the difference between Biden and Bernie. Biden is skilled enough to unite the left and enough centrists to push legislation while Bernie could barely interact with the Democrats in general.Sure not all the polices go as far as I would like but I can't let perfection be the enemy of progress
33-4-2-3,We need a progressive congress and Senate. It's time that the president's power be reduced. I'd rather have a relatively moderate president and a progressive Senate than a progressive president with a Senate full of Manchins.
33-4-2-3-1,It's incredible how people can't grasp that someone like Trump is only dangerous because we've given the office of President so much more power than it was ever intended to have
33-4-2-3-1-2,That's not true. It's again what the person above said. The only way the Presidency has any limitations at all is if Congress is willing to act to enforce them. That's it. Trump is dangerous for his temperament and undying loyalty from his supporters. There's nothing you can do to the Presidency that couldn't be broken by a similar President and a similarly loyal and cowardly legislature.
33-4-2-5,I don’t know how we can consider Biden not “truly progressive” with all the progress he’s been making.
33-4-5,"Yes! Students should be accepted on their ability to complete the course material - nothing else.We could solve the doctor shortage, the teacher shortage and solve so many problems by doing this. I think it would be good for future police to be required to get a degree as well. At this point, they need a high school diploma (or fed( and a few months of training."
33-5,"My husband was doing the math on the current trend of colleges jacking up rates every year and calculated that an undergraduate education would cost half a million for our kindergartener if the trend continues. It's insane.Edit: For clarification, we're talking about the projected out-of-state tuition at a good public university in 2035. Right now, it's $30-$50K (or more) per year, and would be more than $100K in 2035. In-state tuition would be about 1/3-1/4 of that, while private schools could be considerably more."
33-5-1,"Yeah I recently got a financial planner. When discussing saving for college for our preschooler, they said be prepared in the ball park of $80k for a public university, PER YEAR. They said we'd have to put away about a grand a month to possibly achieve that.That is insane."
33-5-1-3,Get your kid a good tutor for German or French - if they can demonstrate fluency by the time they're 18 they can go for next to nothing in Europe
33-5-2,"At like a state school? It cost $125,000-$160,000 more than ten years ago for some top private universities"
33-5-2-1,"The average in-state cost (total) for a public school is just shy of $30k/year for attendance. For out-of-state it's about $45k.&#x200B;For comparison-sake. Tuition alone for Harvard is $51k. They, however, also have a nice financial aid package which heavily benefit families that make less than 150k. Tuition free if you are low income."
33-5-2-1-1,"Yeah my kid goes to Cornell. Fall tuition was $32,000. I paid $1,800. She won't have any debt when she graduates. Feels good, man. I feel like all schools should have the same income based sliding scale, but they just can't resist that sweet, sweet easy credit rip-off money they get from student loans."
33-5-2-1-1-1,"TBF lots of schools don't sit on the same giant pile of cash that the Ivys have. The massive endowments allow them to use the interest to subsidize poorer students. Schools with smaller endowments, smaller pools of fantastically rich alumni donating regularly, etc are more reliant on tuition to justify all the shiny sports equipment, the excess of stadiums and other big ticket items they're constantly trying to pay for."
33-5-2-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, I understand the endowment thing. I was thinking of Texas, where she also got admitted, who has an enormous endowment, and wanted tens of thousands of dollars out of me for in-state."
33-5-2-1-1-1-1-1,"When I was looking at schools 20+ years ago, I was super-interested in Texas because in-state tuition was crazy cheap ($900 something dollars) - I was considering moving there to get a job for a year and then going in-state. It was like 1/2 to 1/3 of what normal in-state tuition was."
33-5-2-1-2,"Penn State University - Out of state tuition: $38,651/year, In state: $19,286/ year.Without any extra grants or scholarships l, it costs PA residents almost $80,000k to earn a degree from the state’s flagship university."
33-5-2-1-2-3,"Lmao, I remember almost 20 years ago, belligerently yelling at PSU President Graham Spanier as he went by on the homecoming float to ""lower our fucking tuition!""  He saw me.  He shrugged.  Hope he's still in jail for the Sandusky shit, that prick."
33-5-2-1-3,But that also includes like 20k for living expenses
33-5-2-4,"Yes, at a state school, not just private colleges. Particularly a state school in another state with out-of-state tuition."
33-5-3,I'm going to encourage my kids to go to college in europe instead of the states (unless they get full or almost full rides)

34-1-1-1-1-3,Like Gaetz!
34-1-1-1-1-3-1,"I mean, the Gaetz thing pisses me off more than Trump to be honest. Trump you can, at least, see that he’s followed mob protocol and nothing can be “traced” directly to him. Gaetz, they have fucking receipts about his trafficking.  The fact that he isn’t currently rotting in a cell after the several year court case that time would have allowed for (assuming he could drag it indefinitely) is ludicrous. Like Gaetz hasn’t even seen the inside of a court room on this shit and they have him dead to rights.  Hell, not only that, he’s joking about this shit while other members of the MAGOP are trying to get him on committees about protecting children"
34-1-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Not sure how Gaetz can possibly piss you off more when Trumps' actions actually put our very Republic at risk.But unfortunately, way too many people just kind of miss the whole point. However if more people would actually put that fact into perspective maybe less people might just be a little less tolerant of what Trump actually did do."
34-1-1-2,What is true is that he Inquired into the process of a president could pardon himself.   (He could not)
34-1-1-2-1,"Of course he did lol, what a fucking loser."

34-1-1-4-1,"“When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”"
34-2,Ffs we all saw it with our own eyes. There is no dispute to anyone honest with themselves. Which is the problem really. There are a shit ton of very dishonest people who are not just lying to everyone else but in many cases themselves.To say nothing of the fact that if you just removed Trump from the equation it would not have happened.
34-2-1,"“… if you just removed Trump from the equation it would not have happened.”Simple, glaringly obvious truth & common sense is music to the ears these days."
34-2-1-1,And yet we also can't let them use Trump as a scapegoat and ignore the members of Congress who were also involved.
34-2-1-1-1,"Absolutely! Just as critically important. In some ways more so in light of the ongoing local intimidation, denial candidates and effort to take control of elections."

34-2-2-1,"Also remember that the displays next to the stage were calling it the ""Save America Rally."" I realize now that rhetoric has been said so much it lost a lot of its umph, but to his supporters, they really did feel it was all on the line. That this was their last chance. And they were convinced of that because of months of conditioning by trump and his lackies."
34-2-2-1-1,"If anyone followed Parler leading up to it, it was obvious they saw it as take the country by force or lose it completely. People were ready to die attending the 6th"

34-2-2-1-1-2,">People were ready to die attending the 6thNahh. They were horney as fuck to *kill*, but trumpism is too inherently selfish for its followers to actually be willing to die for it. The mob didn't stop when they beat a cop to death, or as they stepped over the 150 cops they put in the hospital. It was only when one of the insurrectionists died that the violent mob stopped."
34-2-3,On TV on national television. On every news station. This is insane how he isn't thrown in jail for treason. Anyone else would be in chains.

34-2-4,"I remember when it happened, my ex texted me “are you seeing this?” And I replied, “yeah, pretty much expected something like this”. So did she.It wasn’t even a surprise when it happened, anyone who was paying any attention before Jan 6 knew something like that was going to happen. If common people like myself knew it was gonna happen, so did anyone who could have prevented it."
34-2-4-1,This. I couldn't believe Trump got a permit to hold a rally on the mall during the electroral vote. Simply imsane. It was like hamding an arsonist a gallon of gasoline. Then people died. Why is Trump not in prison?
34-3,"Wasn’t a riot, it was a coup attempt orchestrated by Trump."

34-3-2-3,">That anyone thought it would work takes a shocking level of idiocyMAGAs, taken collectively, are an extension of their leader's personality.So yes of course it was stupid.It couldn't have NOT happened though.  Orange Stalin thinks he's the savior of America - because that's how grandiose and full of himself to the most absurd degree imaginable he is.  And to be part of Orange Stalin's cult of personality means, *do whatever it takes, tell whatever lies you need to tell, to keep the guy at the top happy, or he goes completely ballistic and he's super scary when he goes ballistic -* full stop.The situation with Orange Stalin and his cult is so insane.  Leaving a cult is one of the most emotionally difficult things a person can do, and very few people who get pulled into one are able to honestly face up to the fact that they got taken in, and then extract themselves from it.  It's easier to double down and go along with the lie until the bitter end."

37-1-1-1-1-3-2,Dear god. Imagine an “Always Sunny In Philadelphia” episode with him outside a sex shop and crematorium and landscaping business with black dye running down his face and him screaming?
37-1-1-1-1-4,Dude. He was my cities mayor once. We gave the world this melting egg and and an orange turd pile. NY’ reputation will never recover from this
37-1-1-1-1-4-2,Dude New Yorkers tried to warn everyone about trump.
37-1-1-1-1-4-2-2,"Not half as loud as the hundreds of families he screwed over and bankrupted in Atlantic City... or his own managers at ""Little Moscow"" and ""Narco-a-Lago"".... or his own co-author, or former business partners, or family, or..."
37-1-1-1-1-4-2-5,"I've always known him as a glorified, gilded slumlord."
37-1-1-1-1-5,I’m starting to think this is all a simulation and God or the aliens or whatever are like a player at the end of a open world game when they get bored and start doing the weirdest and worst stuff possible while they wait for the next DLC.
37-1-1-1-1-5-1,
37-1-1-1-1-5-1-1,"Future historians: Please note that image isn't satire, that really did happen!"
37-1-1-2,Holy shit is that a real quote?
37-1-1-2-2,"Richard Donoghue (the Acting Deputy Attorney General on January 6th) testified before congress that Rudolph said something to that effect, yes."
37-1-1-2-4,I haven't seen anyone ask that in this sub since Biden took office.
37-1-1-2-4-3,You should worry about your own piece of shit coming up the road Pierre poilievre lmfao
37-1-1-2-4-3-1,">Pierre poilievreYou know he is Canadian, right?  This is a thread about U.S. politics, so I don't see what you are getting at."
37-1-1-2-4-3-1-1,Sorry dude I thought I saw a Canadian flag my bad
37-2,"Georgia state law says 1 year in jail, $1000 fine, or both.    "
37-2-1,"Fines should REALLY be assessed as a function of income. For many low to lower middle class income folks, $1000 probably forces them to cut back for at least a few months to make up for it. For wealthier middle class and folks with established savings it's like 'eh'; they don't want to pay, but it really isn't a big deal. Then there's someone like Trump where it's like you might as well fine him 1¢ because that would be effectively the same. It seems ridiculous that someone would effectively be penalized more than someone else for the same crime."
37-2-1-1,"Saw somewhere that fines mean certain things are only illegal for poor people, and that's stuck with me."
37-2-1-1-1,It’s not just figurative either. I’ve known some wealthier people that considered fines as fees to do the thing. And they’d have so many resources that they didn’t care.
37-2-1-1-1-1,"my asshole of a FIL would get speeding tickets like twice a week going to work. The same camera every time. The obvious solution is just to slow down, but he just decided that was part of the expenses of his car. The ironic thing was that the MIL was the breadwinner by far, so he was just wasting her money."
37-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Weird… In many states, speeding will get you points on your license, leading to suspension or removal. In mine, three moving violations within 18 months could lead to suspension or revoking the license - certainly revoking if you were just continually getting tickets twice a week. Then continuing to accrue them would mean a court date and potential jail time."
37-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,Not for a camera though.
37-2-1-1-1-5,"If you ever get higher up in the business world they have meetings called a ""cost-benefit analysis"" where they risk the income gained from breaking the law against the cost of the fine.  Of course they're going to break the law if the fine is small enough and the profit is large enough."
37-2-1-1-2,"Absolutely. Think about it, for a lower income person, a parking ticket could be an expensive fee. For a wealthier person, a parking ticket is just rent to park their car there."
37-2-1-1-2-2,Bezos blocked his whole street with construction equipment to build a mansion cuz the only punishment was fines. He's got unlimited money so he made the obvious-to-shitheads choice and fucked things up for everyone around him
37-2-1-3,"Way too much fucking thought, that. Take their TIME. Nobody gets more of that. We can even remove incarceration and just force them to spend **all** of their free moments picking up litter for a few years."
37-2-1-3-1,> Nobody gets more of that. that's ... not true. A person working two 30 hr a week jobs to make ends meet does not have the same amount of TIME as a person working 0 hours a week and living off a trust fund.
37-2-2,That's for you and me.The rich and powerful are sentenced to pats on the back and cigars.
37-2-2-1,"How does 1 year sit at the same level as 1,000$?"
37-2-2-1-1,Remember your stimulus check from covid? That's the thought process. Now you understand.
37-2-2-1-2,"It’s calibrated to poor people, so poor people go to jail, making them legally enslaveable, while people who have enough money don’t face consequences."
37-2-2-1-2-1,">legally enslaveableI think a lot of people may read this as hyperbole but it is not. Slavery is 100% legal in the United States as a punishment for crime. 13th Amendment:>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
37-2-2-1-4,"The lower end of “middle class” for a couple in Georgia is around $34,000. A $1000 fine could be devastating to someone with no liquid assets living paycheck to paycheck."
37-2-2-1-4-1,Think about what a year in jail would do to those assets. I know 3 people total that could afford to keep their house and car if they couldn’t work for a year
37-2-2-1-4-1-1,Just a year in prison in Georgia can and often does lead to a lifetime of financial struggles due to [how fucked the economics of the prison system there are.]
37-2-2-1-5,"""how much could one banana cost Michael?"""
37-2-3,Lying under oath was the end of the world for conservatives when Clinton did it. Surely they'll feel the same about Trump.
37-2-3-2,Seriously. Clinton did it about an affair. That's way less serious than lying while trying to overturn an election.
37-2-3-2-1,"He didn’t, though. The opposing lawyer asked him if he had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and that lawyer defined the term as “penis in vagina sex.”Clinton did not have penis in vagina sex with her (it was a blowjob), so when he said “no, I did not have sexual relations with her,” he was not lying *per the definition the other guy was using.*"
37-2-3-2-1-1,"While this is absolutely true,  because of the Republicans narrative about this most people remember that he ""lied"" under oath about a blow job."
37-2-3-2-1-1-1,"Yep. It’s a thing I like to correct when I hear it or see it, though, much like the story of the lady who was burned by McDonald’s coffee and won a massive lawsuit. I find telling people the true story actually makes them stop and think about other shit they were fed lies about by the media."
37-2-5,When this is done by an elected official it really should have unrecoverable consequences.  Life in prison without parole would be a start.  It is simply unacceptable for the government to exist for itself and not the society that gives government its authority.
37-3,"Can we please, PLEASE, just send the idiot to jail!"
37-3-1,"Prison, not jail. Prison is where convicted offenders serve out long sentences. Jail is too good for that festering orange turd."
37-3-1-1,"Did he undercook fish? Yes? Then go straight to jail. No? then he go to prison,"
37-3-1-1-1,Irrelevant. He microwaved it. Death sentence.
37-3-1-2,Let’s not kid ourselves. You can’t jail a former president like the rest of the population. Best case (worst case for him) is he gets sent to some military prison and is in isolation from anyone else. Most likely scenario if he faces any punishment will essentially be house arrest.
37-3-1-2-1,He will flee to Russia long before he has to face any real repercussions for any of this.  He'll be referred to as the ~~Exiled Former POTUS~~.Edit Better Title: **Exiled Twice Impeached One Term Disgraced Former President**
37-3-1-2-1-4,And I’m okay with this scenario.
37-3-2,Hard to do when a big chunk of people treat him as a God that can't do wrong. Let's not forget that conservatives would argue that this is politically motivated.
37-3-2-1,Do it anyways. Republicans are going to scream they are victims and insult everyone no matter what happens to Trump. Might as well prosecute his numerous crimes.
37-3-2-1-1,> Republicans are going to scream they are victims and insult everyone That's their Jam!
37-3-2-4,"This so called argument of ""political motivation "" must not interfere with the due process of law in this country.   Although Trump's followers may be blind to all of this,  anyone else who has been paying attention knows these criminal actions would be swiftly and severely punished if anyone else were to try them.   We cannot have a country where wealthy politicians are above the law.   Eventually the people will not stand for it and this could start another civil war."
37-3-4,This is not a rhetorical question: does anyone know why he has not yet been arrested? It seems like it has been proven that he has broken many laws.
37-3-4-1,"At this point, trump can shoot someone point blank in the head on live tv and this mofo still won’t go to jail. He’s an ex-president with money and lots and lots of influence with a loyal fanbase. It’s tiring waiting for him to finally meet some goddamn consequences"
37-3-5,Doubtful he will ever go to jail/prison but at least keep him out of politics and barred from public office.
37-4,Honest question:  how much crime is enough?Where is the line where we finally think about holding this guy accountable?
37-4-1,He can shoot someone on 5th Avenue and get away with it.
37-4-1-1,"""there was probably a reason, people don't just shoot people for no reason. YEAH I KNOW there's a video showing that he just walked up and shot someone and laughed but you haven't heard his side! Yes i know he refuses to give his side, but that's only because you liberals would twist it! okay yeah he said he did it to own the libs but that's just a joke! yeah okay he killed someone as a joke, geeze why are you so hung up this shit, gas prices are high it was only one person omg!"" &#x200B;there, i summarized it all for you ahead of time."
37-4-1-1-1,"“Plus they were in New York so there’s a chance they were a far left liberal with pronouns, folks. Probably trying to plan their next **coup** to steal another election. That’s what I heard anyway, that’s what people are saying.”- probably Donald Trump, a native New Yorker."
37-4-1-1-1-1,"""And crime is up, that person would have been shot regardless. So really I didn't do anything, that wouldn't have happened anyway."""
37-4-1-1-1-1-1,“I was just making the process more efficient.”
37-4-2,"Steal food to feed your family and you'll be lucky if you still have your freedom in a weekTry to steal a country for white supremacists and enough people are ok with it, you might get away with it (we all know maga is the new kkk, let's not beat around the bush)"
37-4-2-1,I’d say maga is more like the new 1930’s nazi Germany. That’s a more accurate comparison.
37-4-3,2 theories:1.	There is no line. 2.	The line is on a circular track and he constantly crosses it but each time he crosses it he just lies and convinces the overlords that the line is still in front of him.

37-5,"Almost 250 years after kicking the monarchy to the curb, and we're debating whether or not a former president is legally untouchable when he commits blatant crimes in plain view of the public. This country is built on a fucking lie."
37-5-1,"I am calling it now. After the UK having their Prime Minister resign, if Boris Johnson is brought back as PM, you will see Conservatives clamor and claim trump should come back, using that as a reason our government should operate the same way."
37-5-1-1,There's a few things. 1) It's very unlikely he will come back as public anger at him having a party during covid and lying  was enough to end him (i.e. not the same level as trying to overthrow our government and enabling (vulnerable) angry people to split our country   2)  US Conservatives have been claiming Trump should come back based on provable bollocks for ages already.  They don't need us as an excuse.
38,"Donald Trump will be arrested next week, he is calling for his insurrectionist to fight law enforcement."
38-1,Did he just say FORMER president?
38-1-1,Even he can’t keep his bullshit straight.
38-1-1-1,"Honestly, his face is constantly just erupting with word salad so much, I don't even think he hears himself anymore."
38-1-1-1-1,Salad? More like word McDonalds
38-1-1-1-1-1,McDonald's is still edible. This is verbal diarrhea.
38-1-1-1-1-1-1,In western New York we call it a word garbage plate.
38-1-1-3,I was surprised that he didn't use “beloved former president” /s
38-1-1-3-1,"Or the much-used ""your favorite president,"" which always makes me want to vomit."
38-1-2,Fear is making him lose track of all the lies!
38-1-2-1,It had to be TERROR sweat!
38-1-2-1-1,Upvoting your Simpson’s reference
38-1-2-1-1-1,"That means Donald Trump was the left, or sinister, twin all along!!"
38-1-2-1-1-1-1,Why... I doubt he's even seen his own reflection in a mirror...&#x200B;
38-1-2-1-1-1-1-1,One of the absolute greatest gags on the Simpsons
38-1-2-1-1-1-3,"Oh, don't look so shocked."
38-1-2-1-3,You can tell because his orange starts leaking off onto his majestic corpulent frame.
38-1-2-2,"How many people is this guy going to literally get killed with his loud mouth, insecure actions…insanity."
38-1-2-2-1,I feel bad for the Secret Service agents assigned to this fucking coward.He got that rotting syphilis brain.
38-1-2-2-1-1,It's likely some of them are fine with it.
38-1-2-2-1-1-1,"No shit. You think they deleted their texts from Jan 6th cause they aren’t in part kind on his side? I think some people forget how right wing most cops, federal agents and the military are."
38-1-2-2-1-1-1-3,My son-in-law is deputy sheriff in rural MO. His FB posts are toxic with hate for democrats.
38-1-2-2-1-1-2,Sycophant Service
38-1-2-2-1-1-2-1,"Seditious Service.To clarify, not the entire Secret Service but there is an element that qualifies."
38-1-2-2-1-1-2-2,I read that as Syphilis Service.
38-1-2-2-1-1-4,My cousin married a Secret Service agent who retired after Trump left. He's a huge Trump fan.
38-1-2-2-1-2,He Capone'd himself
38-1-2-2-3,"i 100% think that he doesnt care. hes the type that will let hundreds of his own people die and walk over their corpses if it means he gets what he wants on the other side. ""brave people every one, you will be remembered! ....whoever you were....your country loves you!"""
38-1-2-2-4,"Sorry, but if at this point you’re still following this orange idiot you kind of deserve whatever you’re going to run into because of following said orange idiot.."
38-1-3,"I'm still learning about politics and all that, that seems like the only line that wasn't insanity from trump, is he not the former president?  Why'd you point that part out?"
38-1-3-1,Because he and his followers still claim that he is the shadow president or the rightful president or whatever theory makes the voices go away for a few seconds. He never conceded the race and still claims he is the president.
38-1-3-1-1,"The problem with that is if he maintains that position, then he has used up his two terms. He can't run in the 2024 election if he has served two terms. He now has to admit he is a former president."
38-1-3-1-1-1,You're trying to use logic to understand this. Inadvisable.
38-1-3-1-1-1-1,"Yeah, a very good point."
38-1-3-1-1-1-1-1,This is what it's like to live with an unhinged and profoundly mentally ill person btw.  The instinct to always apply logic to illogical/abusive people who just use whatever argument suits them at the moment.  It's maddening.
38-1-3-1-1-3,"Bold of you to assume Trump will suddenly start paying attention to, and abiding by, the laws of this country."
38-2,King of the run on sentence. Hope that’s not the only sentence that runs on forever.
38-2-1,"The only thing he'll be running in 2024 is the prison yard, if he's lucky."

38-2-2,"WHAT DID YOU SAY, I COULD NOT HEAR YOU IN SMALL CAPS, MY DOCTOR SAY I HAVE THE BEST HEARING HE'S EVER SEEN FOR SOMEOME WOTH HANDS AS LARGE AS MINE BUT YOU NEED TO SPEAKER LOUDER!"
38-3,So he admits he's rightfully the former president....
38-3-1,!
38-3-1-1,And his supporters will still twist it. “He’s just saying that. Everyone knows it was stolen. Have you seen 3000 mules?”
38-3-1-1-1,I tried watching that movie.  Anyone that believes that shit has to be the dumbest most gullible shit head to have ever lived.
38-3-1-1-1-1,"I mean, it *is* a Dinesh D'Souza ""documentary""."
38-3-1-1-1-1-1,"When I was still on Twitter, I think Dinesh was the first person I blocked.He's consistently wrong. So either he's the best idiot in the world, or it's intentional."

38-3-1-2-1-1-1-2,"It’s so fucking good. It kinda reminds of whitest kids u know in the way that it’s so ridiculous but hilarious, but then it’s also it’s own thing that’s really unique. Really wanting another season."
38-4,I prefer presidents who weren't captured.
38-4-1,"As a service member, when Trump said that, it pissed me the fuck off. The guy isn’t loyal except to himself, everything is always someone else’s fault, what a piece of shit."
38-4-1-2,How any veteran supports him much less Vietnam vets is infuriating.  He dodged the draft 6 times.  And vets support that???
38-5,Nothing says that you’re a crazy fascist lunatic more than screaming in all caps about how George Soros is to blame for everything.
38-5-1,I don’t know much about Soros but I assume the guy sees his name on the news and is like „sigh what have I done this time?“
38-5-1-1,He’s a Jewish millionaire. Basically every reference of him is an antisemitic dog whistle.
38-5-1-1-1,"He pissed off Rupert Murdoch decades ago, so now one billionaire uses his media empire to attack another billionaire, and right wingers talk about Soros conspiracy theories without realizing why."
38-5-1-1-1-1,The reason why is to drum up feelings of antisemitism and push the narrative of a secret Jewish cabal controlling the world.
38-5-2,Came here looking for this. The way he just threw out George Soros name. He knows his target audience. 
38-5-3,Nothing screams fascist quite like antisemitism.
38-5-3-1,"Honestly, is George Soros even alive at this point?  Has anyone heard from him in the last decade?  Also his net worth is nothing compared to the heavy hitters.  Why pick on him?"
39,Trump Jr. accused of 'treason' after pre-Jan. 6 texts to Meadows revealed
39-1,"It may have been a little light treason, Michael."
39-1-1,"After all the similarities, we will soon find financial evidence in a banana stand..."
39-1-1-1,"Almost all of Trump's businesses are banana stands. The banana stand in Arrested Development is to facilitate money laundering. That's why *there's always money in it*. The money coming from his *light treason* in Iraq is being funneled through there, because unless the IRS is surveilling it 24/7... how do they know how many bananas are actually being sold to real people?---How many Trump hotel rooms are rented on any given day? Who are they being rented to? How are rates set? Are we sure that every green fee at the golf courses is actually tied to a person playing golf? How many members of Mar a Lago have paid the ""initiation fee"" and never shown up?  Is the real estate being sold for fair prices? Who's buying it? There are a lot of ways to push money into the system."
39-1-1-1-1,"Years ago, a friend of mine was temporarily housed in Trump Tower while doing a work project. Recently she went back and saw the same old doorman and asked how things were going these days in Trump Tower. He said the place is full of Russians now, all paying exorbitant prices to live there. It’s a banana stand…"
39-1-1-1-1-2,I had a time share in Sunny Isles Florida. Someone bought our week (we actually made a profit!) it turned out it was Trump and it was turned into condos now owned all by Russians. Everyone in the area was Russian too..
39-1-1-1-2,"It's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, $10?"
39-1-1-1-2-1,"Holy shit, this joke just hit on a whole new level..."
39-1-1-1-2-1-1,Wait a minute… holy shit you’re right. Here I thought it was because they were so rich they had no idea what normal things cost. This blows my mind.
39-1-1-1-3,This makes me realize gyms would be perfect for this small-scale.
39-1-1-1-3-1,"Gyms, laundromats, car washes, nightclubs... anything that has membership/cover charges or repeatable services."
39-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Deli counters are another classic. Ever see an Italian deli that is somehow open for 5 hours 4 days a week, never seems all *that* busy and also handles their own line of imported goods?"
39-1-2,"I read this comment and thought to myself, I wonder if they were based on the trump family?Googled it and was actually based on the bush family first, and then the trump family lol"
39-1-2-1,Wow... How did I never equate George Bluth with George Bush?
39-1-3,I've made a huge mistake.
39-1-5,*Those are balls*
39-2,The entire trump crime family needs to be put in prison for treason.
39-2-1,"Not just trump. This is the entirety of the republican apparatus. Just look at how they continue to spread lies about stolen elections. It's all part of the plan. I've said it once and I'll say it again: this country can make no progress until the threat of republican terrorism is dealt with. Unfortunately, we elected the one guy who all but promised to do nothing about it. He's still under the impression he can work with Republicans, and it's so depressing. Biden is on his knees begging them to come back to the negotiating table, and they're out there telling everyone Biden isn't even the president. If Biden can't see the threat, I don't know what to tell him. Something needs to be done, and it should have been done on day 1 of his presidency. I fear it's too late now."
39-2-1-2,And now they are trying to say that all primary teachers are pedos...  What in the actual fuck
39-2-1-5,Everything would be so much easier if you could put the opposition in prison.
39-2-1-5-1,"If the opposition breaks the law with seditious treason, then yes."
39-2-3,Capital punishment
39-3,"*Wait, so the guy who met with Russians at Trump Tower (along with his father’s Campaign Manager Paul Manafort and Brother-in-Law Jared Kushner) to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in exchange for relaxing sanctions on Russia is accused of treason? Wow, we never could’ve seen this coming.*"
39-3-1,Could you imagine a timeline where all the Trumps and associates are in prison?
39-3-1-3,I can imagine Trump in jail with Big Bubba as his cellmate.
39-3-1-4,Could we have a parade?
39-3-2,Did anyone really believe their meeting with the  Russia people at the trump tower  is about  adoption? The trump family got away with a lot of shady collusion with the Russians in 2016. Our AG was Barr then reason they got away.
39-4,Jail…it’s that simple. Stop letting rich fucks get away with what ever the hell they want. The evidence is right there in plain sight. Stop pussyfooting around and just get it doneEdit: Wow thank you kind redditors for all the awards and engagement. And a special thanks to the “concerned redditor” who reported me as being potentially suicidal. Lol not quite the case but maybe they just didn’t like my comment or the idea of their criminal prince being held accountable for his actions.
39-4-1,You articulate what a lot of people are thinking.
39-4-1-1,"Can confirm, am people, are thinking.These people are basically advertising their crimes in broad daylight. The meager 99% of us who are actually affected by the justice system are sitting here thinking, when them? It's not like we're asking for special treatment, we're literally asking for *equal* treatment. Their crimes would have any one of us thrown in jail for life. So... when them?"
39-4-1-1-1,"If you think there will be equal treatment by the American justice system for the rich and powerful, you will ~~almost~~ always be disappointed."
39-4-1-1-1-1,"Never said I think there will be... just saying that according to the law, there *should* be. As long as the rich are able to simply ignore the law, then the law clearly means nothing."
39-4-1-1-1-1-2,The law means nothing for rich people. It means everything if you are black and selling cigarettes on a street corner.
39-4-1-1-1-3,The last prominently known rich person I can recall going to jail was Bernie Madoff
39-4-1-1-1-3-1,He was broke and powerless when he went to jail.
39-4-1-1-1-3-1-2,"And he stole from the ""rich""."
39-4-1-1-1-3-1-4,"but before, just like the Trumps, he was considered untouchable,  and in the investment world 'a bond market visionary"".No one, even visionaries, are beyond the law. That's what the USA is all about. JAIL THEM!"
39-4-1-1-2,They don't see us as their equals.
39-4-1-1-4,George Floyd got summary execution for trying to pass a fake $20.
39-4-1-1-5,"Agreed. Although I do think they deserve justice, I am even getting aggravated when I see new news about the capitol insurrectionists being charged or sentenced. They were in the wrong but they aren't the ones who orchestrated the whole thing. If it is obviously criminal, then when will there be accountability for the people who made it happen?"
39-4-1-1-5-2,The riot and the conspiracy behind the scenes are two separate horrible things
39-4-2,Yes but if the rich people start punishing other rich people then they might be able to be punished too. It’s a slippery slope.
39-4-2-1,"I mean, do they want to keep making money or do they want a fascist dictator who will wreck the economy, can seize their assets, and can have them ""disappeared"" for so much as looking sideways at his princest daughter? Because that's what doing nothing gets us."
39-4-2-1-1,"Woah, man! You're talking long term. These are short term *gains* we're talkin. Why are you worrying about repercussions in the future when we can have gains for ourselves and our shareholders *now*!"
39-4-4,"And before any GOP or Right wing folks start spouting anything about Hunter...Yes. If he broke the law, him too."
39-4-4-1,"They're all fucking morons. Yes of course jail Hunter if he did anything. But even if he did, did he try to overthrow the fucking government? They equate a serial killer with a guy who ran over a ladybug and say ""both sides are murderers!"""
39-4-4-1-2,"That’s why they make up such batshit conspiracy theories. Because they know voters buy it hook line and sinker, the left doesn’t take it seriously, and then the right says “See, you look the other way for your guy, we should too!”They’re striking you first to get even because they think you struck the first blow."
39-5,"That's pretty much what it was. A soft coup built on lies, and we seem oddly numb to it all."
39-5-1,"Trump is openly taking credit for the coup now. Just this week, [Trump was bragging about the insurrection’s crowd sizes].>	Trump repeatedly said in his Wednesday interview with The Post that he deserved more credit for the size of the crowd he drew to the “Stop the Steal” rally on the Ellipse, just outside the White House.>	“The crowd was far bigger than I even thought. I believe it was the largest crowd I’ve ever spoken to,” Trump said. “I don’t know what that means, but you see very few pictures. They don’t want to show pictures, the fake news doesn’t want to show pictures. But this was a tremendous crowd.”"
39-5-1-1,He’s so weird about crowd sizes. So. Damn. Weird.
39-5-1-1-2,"He’s a brazen narcissist, it’s his whole brand."
39-5-1-1-3,"No, he’s trying to brag to them, to embolden them, to make them feel proud for ‘supporting’ their country and President. He is a total shitheel, and this is just more of him grooming his cult."
39-5-1-2,Still butt hurt that Obama had a larger inauguration crowd and trying to convince himself he’s more popular than him but with the “right” people.
39-5-1-2-1,"Just bizarre what triggers Trump's ego. Let it go man, just let it go."
39-5-1-2-1-1,"But Obama made fun of him once years ago, how could he let that go! I'd add the /s tag but it doesn't apply here."
39-5-1-2-1-1-1,"[Obama roasts Trump during the Whitehouse Correspondence Dinner in 2011 (5 min)]. He starts making fun of Trump personally beginning ~2:40, but the joke before that is pretty funny as well.Once again, our nation's problems are a direct result of Obamas actions.Thanks Obama."
39-5-1-2-1-1-1-4,That was such a beautiful moment. :-)
39-5-1-2-1-3,"I have a theory that his ego will bring him down. People will start a meme saying ""Hilary would have testified"" in reference to trumps refusal to testify with regards to Jan 6th, and Clinton's testimonial marathon during Benghazi.To try and save face after being ridiculed in social and traditional media for Clinton being ""tougher"", Trump agrees to testify.They make a movie about it a few years later because of how amazing it is. Brendan Gleeson wins an Oscar for his performance as Trump.I'm also not a time traveller."
39-5-1-2-1-5,"Years of yes-men and severe drug abuse, not to mention his incredibly low intellect BEFORE he rotted his brain to a dark crusty nub, have made it impossible for Trump to be even remotely capable of self reflection."
39-5-1-2-2,I don’t believe any future President will ever top the turn out Obama had for his inauguration.
39-5-1-2-2-1,Maybe if a populist becomes the first female President.  Someone like AOC rather than Hillary.  It's a long shot though.
39-5-1-2-4,"Trump trying to lie about his inauguration drawing more people than Obamas, to the point of trying to use visual aides (that backfired) is going to go down in history as one of the weirdest events in the beginning of a  presidents term ever.Like, of all the ways to soothe a narcissistic wound, how could you think lying about an easily-provable objective thing like the size of one crowd versus another would make you seem ""better"" rather than seem like a total idiot?"
39-5-1-3,Why anyone in that crowd thinks a rich prick like trump would want to spend a second with them outside of manipulating them to do his bidding is beyond me.
39-5-3,A soft coup? People died.Define Hard coup
39-5-3-1,"Military takes over government with actual weapons? We would be arguing semantics over something not really defined. But as far as coups go this one was fairly low on the violence and no guns were fired by the insurrectionists and no bombs were detonated. This is in no way a defense of these morons. Just pointing out that things could have been a lot more violent given historical comparisons, putting this event way more on the 'soft' end of the scale. From what we witnessed and have uncovered since there were a lot of behind the scenes planners and co-conspirators required, far more than have been charged. These people in positions of power and influence need to be brought to justice or we'll see this attempted again and again until they succeed."
39-5-3-1-1,It was a trial run and now the genie is out of the bottle . I honestly don’t think there is anything we can do to stop these people from doing this in every election they lose from now on. It’s like the Columbine shooting. Now that damaged people realize it’s an option we are going to see it again and again.
40,Appeals court says House can obtain Trump's taxes from the IRS
40-1,"Releasing one's tax returns should be a requirement to run for office, especially for such a sensitive position as POTUS. The fact that he has been fighting tooth and nail, for *years,* against their release tells you how corrupt he is."
40-1-1,"There are countries where tax filings are public documents. Makes it much harder to lie on them.The Trump family seems to have for decades claimed one estate value to banks when borrowing, and another to IRS when paying taxes. If they can prove that also for years that haven't hit the statute of limitations, then it's bank fraud, or tax fraud, or both. Probably both."
40-1-1-1,"Not a lawyer, but I thought that the timeline for the statute of limitations BEGAN when harm is discovered. So if they are only able to retrieve the documents now, and discover he's been cheating on taxes, the clock would start now, not back when he did the cheating. Again, not a lawyer, but I don't think the statute would protect him here.Edit: read below, I'm probably not right in general, and this may only apply in some circumstances."
40-1-1-1-2,"You are not correct: In general, the statute of limitations measures from the date of the crime."
40-1-1-1-2-1,"Interesting! You've got me down a rabbit hole of laws in different countries (I am not from the USA) and between civil and criminal cases.Just going off your link though, it does suggest that the time would start when the crime was committed,  but not for continuing crimes where there is an ongoing obligation to register or report. Again, not sure about the USA, but in my country if you are aware of a mistake in your taxes you are obligated to report it. I can only assume you guys are the same, and so the statute of limitations wouldn't protect him if they can show he was aware of the fraud. Of course, Trump has been very successful with arguing that he is an idiot who isn't aware of his own two feet..."
40-1-2,I think it should be more than tax returns. Full financial disclosures like anyone who has a security clearance has to do.
40-1-2-1,"Normal security background check. “Sir it seems you once had a reward card at Shawarma Deluxe and a Mr Gyro. Could you please explain the nature of the rewards and the relationship with these businesses and their owners?” For POTUS “You are a huge security risk, have a fragile ego, have been sued, filed bankruptcy multiple times and seem to be less trustworthy than the homeless person who exhorts passing individuals to keep them from masturbating in front of the Wendy’s uptown. But, you have been voted in so, welcome aboard POTUS.” That’s so fucked up."
40-1-2-2,The whole point of full financial disclosures for security clearances is to prevent people who might be susceptible to blackmail from receiving them. Trump may not have qualified to run under those circumstances.
40-1-2-2-3,Voters should decide if he’s qualified but they should definitely have all the details in order to do so
40-1-2-2-3-1,"No.  The details should determine if he's qualified to run in the first place.  Edit: Details aside, he was never qualified to run in the first place."
40-1-2-2-3-1-1,"The only official qualifications for President are being 35 years old, being a natural born citizen, living in the U.S. for 14 years, and not having exceeded the term limit. Beyond that, it is literally up to the ~~voters~~ electoral college."
40-2,"I think Trump is having a really bad day, and that makes me smile today."
40-2-1,"You mean bad week. His real estate appraiser handed over 36,000+ documents to the NY AG, photos surfaced showing him trying to flush classified documents, and his home/mar-a-lago was raided by the FBI.Edit: now his tax documents are immediately being released to the house.I’m looking forward to what tomorrow brings Edit 2: changed advisor to appraiser"
40-2-1-1,"This is the guy the GOP has tied themselves to, it’s kind of baffling to me.  It was readily apparent he was going to continue to be a rancid turd on their punch bowl after his presidency yet the party leadership rejected every opportunity to flush him."
40-2-1-1-1,"Here’s the thing about Trump.“Smart people” enter his orbit thinking they can take advantage of him to get what they want.As soon as they get in close, he grabs onto them and offers them deals that give them some of what they want in exchange for selling out their principles. As they sell more and more of themselves to him, he demands more and more. He changes the terms of the deals to make them worse for the victim and more favorable for himself. By the time they want out, it’s too late. They’re stuck in the swamp and they’re accomplices to his crimes.Trump is a mafia kingpin.He was trained by his father, Roy Cohn, Roger Stone, and New York’s property mafias.Why can’t the Republican Party and Fox News flush him? Because he pulled them into his mafia and most of them are now accomplices to his crimes - Kevin McCarthy,  Rupert Murdoch, Tucker Carlson, Hannity, Ingram, Matt Gaetz, Lindsay Graham, and Trump’s own family."
40-2-1-1-1-5,"Damn, you put my thoughts into words much better than I could.And much like the 'I'll never get addicted to heroin or crack like so many others' crowd, those greedy grubbers who think they are 'smart' get used, fall into the trap, whatever, and swirl down the drain like all the others before them. And there is still a line of fools trying to get into his good graces. This is quite the lesson in psychology and human nature."
40-2-1-1-2,He's a useful idiot.
40-2-1-1-2-1,"He was to begin with, but then he became an extremely popular idiot, much more popular than the rest of them, and yet was even more of an idiot than they ever realised."
40-2-1-1-2-4,I think he’s being transitioned from useful idiot to a patsy
40-2-1-1-2-5,At this point he's quite literally the king of the useful idiots
40-2-1-1-3,"it's not nearly as baffling if you remember that the RNC was hacked at the same time as the DNC, but we still don't know *anything* about what was in the RNC servers.  there's some serious kompromat/blackmail going on for the *entire party* to be so beholden to an obvious grifter and criminal."
40-2-1-1-5,All he had to do was NOT run for president and none of this would happen. What an idiot.
40-2-1-1-5-1,He was as surprised as anyone when he won.
40-2-1-1-5-1-1,"Surprised and unhappy. Guy looked like he saw a ghost when it was announced. The whole thing was supposed to be a grift, get popular, start a social media and possibly news station where he could put his conspiracy theories and racist bullshit to grift the idiots."
40-2-1-1-5-1-2,"Yep. It was supposed to be a con allowing him to rake in donations from the rubes and spend it on whatever he wanted due to our country's appalling lack of campaign finance oversight. It really wasn't that bad of an idea for a person with no scruples about being an amoral grifting shitbird. He could have become the racist Ralph Nader, always running but never winning, maybe stealing enough votes to make a little difference in the outcome here and there. He fucked up by underestimating just how tolerant the GOP was of overt racism and rampant corruption."
40-2-1-1-5-2,Agreed. It's kinda weird to watch movies/shows pre-2016 where he would randomly have a cameo or get mentioned favorably. If he never ran for president nobody would have ever known how much of a complete dipshit he is. He also basically lost the potential business of 50% of the US as I can't imagine anyone even remotely left leaning ever doing business with him again. He dun dicked himself pretty hard there. I hope he gets what he deserves.
40-2-1-2,1. mara lago raid2. alex jone's cell phone (lol)3. toilet note pics (lolol)4. irs records -> j6 committee. .... what'd i miss?
40-2-1-2-1,"A judge ruled that his lackey, Giuliani can't avoid his day in court in Georgia."
40-2-1-2-4,God almighty the cell phone thing is good. The plaintiff's attorney just taking first Jones himself then Jones' lawyer to school in front of anyone who cares to watch. It was absolutely glorious. They need to make a courtroom movie with that as the climax.
40-2-1-4,"Mar a Lago wasn't raided by the FBI. The FBI served a search warrant. Believe me, an FBI raid is a completely different animal."
40-2-1-4-1,"What's the difference?It was a no-knock warrant, right?"
40-2-1-4-1-2,"A 'Raid' is the term used if agents believe they'll encounter weapons/resistance.Despite trump attempting to play the victim card (typical of republicans) - he was notified this was going to happen, albeit only minutes before it was executed."
40-2-1-4-1-2-4,"This is an excellent point. Trump's own use of the word 'raid' was adopted immediately by media on both sides, thus defining the rhetorical narrative as he wanted it."
40-2-1-4-1-3,> no-knock warrantThe Secret Service let them in.
40-2-1-4-1-4,Ask David Koresh or any Branch Davidians
40-2-1-4-2,Here’s hoping “raise your glass” to seeing a real “raid” of Mar a Lago. Wouldn’t that be glorious.
40-2-1-4-5,"I love it. First we redefine “illegal immigrant”. Then, a crisis at the border became a “challenge”. Later, we redefine “female”. Recently, we redefined “inflation”. And, now we’re redefining “raid”. Not to leave out “is” (Bill Clinton), and “gay” (happy, cheerful), or I suppose an argument could be made for “racist”, “bigot”, “white supremacy”, “fascism”, “authoritarian”, and likely many more if given further assessment.Merriam-Webster is busy in our modern liberal Democrat woke culture.SOURCE: Merriam-Webster raid 1 : to enter (a place) to look for something or someone or to steal or take something2 : a sudden invasion by officers of the law"
40-2-1-4-5-1,Wouldn't be a proper Trumpie rant without bringing up Clinton
40-2-3,[My fiancee sent me this earlier this morning]
40-2-4,"Is it Friday, because today was a good day."
40-2-4-1,I bet you didn't even need to use your AK
40-2-4-3,...and the Lakers beat the Supersonics....
40-2-4-4,No barking from the dog!
40-3,An honest successful businessman would have released them 6 years ago.
40-3-1,"Trump promised to release his tax returns in: 2011, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and they have perpetually been ""under audit"" since.It's almost like he lies every time he breathes."
40-3-2,"Literally any person running for office… like, why was this ever ok? It isn’t. If I or anyone else tried to say “ohhh I can’t release those…” then I don’t get to run. That’s it. That’s all."
40-3-2-1,"If he was a real billionaire, his returns would be on display in the lobby."
40-3-2-1-1,"I wish wish wish that every late night host would refer to him as millionaire Donald Trump, that would piss him off more than any other insult."
40-3-2-1-1-4,Well he may be a billionaire NOW but he wasn't before presidency
40-3-2-3,"Or, if you run the IRS automatically releases 10 years of records and there's no way to stop it. Don't want them released? Don't run."
40-3-3,Even a dishonest businessman like Romney released his tax returns. trump won’t release his though because he’s not even a businessman. He’s just a criminal leech.
40-3-5,His whole brand is built on inflated numbers and ego. Once the truth comes out we'll see that he was nothing more than a conman and dirty businessman like the rest of already know.
40-4,"Trump said in 2016 that he would release his tax returns when the audit is finished: It's 2022, six years later, and we are still waiting."
40-4-1,Longest Audit in history....
40-4-1-1,"To be fair, he’s one of the biggest criminals and tax cheats in history so it can be believable that his audit would take this long especially with all the obstruction."
40-4-2,"That's all true, but it's not like we don't know what was in his tax returns. The New York Times obtained two decades of Trump's tax returns, through 2017. They did not publish the actual returns, but did publish an in-depth analysis which included state and business tax documents."
40-5,Ways and Means Committee says it expects to receive Trump’s tax returns “immediately [>    BREAKING: The DC Court of Appeals has just ruled that the law is on our side in seeking Trump's tax returns. We expect to receive the requested tax returns and audit files immediately.
40-5-1,"Article says no action for 7 days, and Trump can still appeal. Would be great to get immediate results, but doesn’t seem likely"
40-5-1-1,How? How many times has this been appealed? It feels like it’s been 6 years at this point
40-5-1-1-1,"It's one of many ways that rich people pay to stay out of jail. If you have enough money to appeal forever, you never really have to go."
40-5-1-1-1-1,There’s a limit though. Each appeal is supposed to go to a higher court unless you can prove the original verdict was fraudulent. How has he been appealing to a higher court for 6 years?
40-5-1-1-2,"And he can appeal it two more times: first to the whole appeals circuit (instead of just a panel)—which will likely uphold this decision—and then to the Supreme Court, which could do whatever it wants now. If he continues to appeal this will likely drag on for several more years."
40-5-1-1-2-3,If it were a legitimate SCOTUS they wouldn't even look at it but with this SCOTUS anything can happen.
40-5-2,"> But Trump still could appeal, making the litigation unlikely to end at this time."
40-5-2-1,Lol oh of course.. how many times can he fucking appeal before they finally force him to turn em over
40-5-2-1-1,His whole business plan is to break laws and appeal into oblivion. Laws don't apply when you can just pay for endless appeals.
40-5-2-1-1-1,He’d appeal a parking ticket to the Supreme Court if it were possible
40-5-2-1-1-1-1,"This, but unironically. The Trump camp has one response: maximum belligerence, maximum aggression. Retaliate all-out to any perceived slight so that anyone who considers holding you accountable (or wants you to pay them for their work,) knows that they’re in for a decade of litigation, counter-suits, defamation and, since 2016, a possible violence at the hands of brownshirts."
40-5-2-1-1-1-1-1,"He’s literally all the worst traits of humanity bundled into a very unsightly orange package. I can’t say anything nice about trump, it’s all bad. He doesn’t even like dogs. What an asshole."
40-5-2-1-1-1-4,"Yep, his childish pettiness is unparalleled. Even if he were completely innocent of everything he's ever been accused of and investigated for (he isn't), he'd still fight every step of the process tooth and nail just to make it a big expensive hassle for everyone else involved. And because it's a way to keep the donations rolling in now that he's a has-been."
40-5-2-3,I spit out my wine when Dershowitz said there was no need for a warrant and search. The FBI could have issued a supeona and Drumpf would've handed over the documents.
40-5-2-3-1,"A ""supeona""? Is that some kind of flower? Have you been smoking it?"
41,Trump’s rally in Ohio features an actual dumpster fire. [OC]
41-1,Wait back up.&#x200B;Trump's still doing rallies?
41-1-1,He's running for president again.  Of course he's doing rallies. He just won't officially announce it because then campaign finance laws kick in.
41-1-1-1,> lawsha ha!
41-1-1-1-1,We have finance laws? Could have fooled me.
41-1-1-1-1-3,">We have finance laws? when the punishment for a crime is a fine, it's legal with a fee."
41-1-1-1-1-3-1,A crime that is punishable by a fine is only illegal if you are poor.
41-1-1-2,He also did rallies the ENTIRE time he was president. That wasn’t normal. I feel like people forget how unusual that was.
41-1-1-2-2,"It was just a re-justification for all parties involved. People would show up, it stocked his ego. He kept holding them, that made people feel important. Repeat cycle. The thing is, they aren't well attended and the numbers have slowed greatly. I'm not saying he doesn't still hold power, it just seems more and more that the GOP is realizing this isn't a sustainable plan. They aren't going to turn on him, but the Trump Party has lost quite a bit of traction."
41-1-1-2-2-1,Trump should set up shop in Vegas and have rallies 4 nights a week.
41-1-1-2-2-1-2,Tan Man Group
41-1-1-2-2-2,"I agree with you but the question/fear I have is the movement has gotten more virulent and extreme. The DeSantis style of calculated, 'legitimized' persecution is becoming more prevalent"
41-1-1-2-2-2-2,DeSantis 2024! Trump needs to go away
41-1-1-2-2-3,"People need to stop saying this, I don't care if they are loosing traction because honestly I really don't know if they are or not.  But I'll tell you what I do know, we better get out there and vote blue because if we get complacent, and allow the likes of him back in that office, it will be over."
41-1-1-2-2-4,I think a lot of the ppl who where showing up to these events died from Covid too.
41-1-1-2-2-4-1,"My wife worked with a dumbass who went to a Trump rally in 2020 without wearing a mask during one of the largest outbreaks in our area of that year and then the woman and her husband got covid and spread it to everybody in the office and it nearly killed the boss, he barely made if off the ventilator, the doctors thought he was going to die for a few days.  Thankfully my wife was working from home so she nor myself weren't infected because of somebody else's ignorance."
41-1-1-2-2-5,I kinda hope he runs again. It would help turn out democrat voters if he becomes the candidate. And if he doesn’t then he’ll do his best to burn down the Republican Party on his way out.
41-1-1-2-5,That dumbass loves his rallies the love makes him feel good.
41-1-1-5,I actually don't think he'll run again.  The rallies were the only part he liked.  He just wants to keep doing those.The rest of being president is a real drag.
41-1-1-5-1,He's 100% running againHe needs to be president to shut down all the investigations.
41-1-1-5-1-2,He also doesn't like to do the same thing twice of he publicly failed at it. Right now he's the best of both worlds. He's grifting people and still has influence in the GOP despite not having any power because of his following.
41-1-1-5-1-2-1,He failed at running for president in the past too.  2016 wasn't his first attempt.
41-1-1-5-1-2-1-1,"I am aware, but like I said publicly. Those previous attempts didn't make an impact so in his twisted mind he could do it again. But look at his other projects and activities, whenever he fails on a massive public scale he never really tries again.And again as others have pointed out he likes the attention and the money sent his way. He doesn't want to lead or be in control because that takes away from his leisure life style.And because of the 2016 he has this power over the GOP through his idiotic fanbase. If the various leaks from the established GOP is to be believed then they all hate him and were hoping to be rid of him multiple times through various events only to back down because their voters love him."
41-1-1-5-1-4,We need to stop deluding ourselves into thinking he'll ever face consequences. Odds are better that he gets reelected.
41-1-1-5-1-4-1,I'm not sure why people are even suggesting otherwise anymore...
41-1-1-5-1-4-1-1,"Copium. Short of vigilante justice, the guy is immune. He probably really could just start shooting people and get away with it. I wouldn't be surprised. How such a colossal dumbass has made himself untouchable, I'll never understand. And I likewise don't understand how our ""leaders"" can expect us to take the justice system seriously at this point. It's such a joke."
41-1-1-5-1-5,Yep! He’s got to control the scales of justice somehow.
41-1-1-5-2,He's a narcissist that publicly lost at something... Of COURSE he's running again
41-1-1-5-2-1,"He might.  I won't be surprised either way honestly.  He's also a narcicist who gets what he most wants (money and adoration) without any real effort by holding rallies. But you're right, if he does run it will be to redeem a loss."
41-1-2,Of course.  There's still million of smoothbrains to scam for cash.
41-1-2-2,Yeah just think about how many people still get scammed from mega churches. They never learn and never will learn.
41-1-2-2-2,"Yep and until the world drastically changes, billions exist only to be indoctrinated into being scammed all their life unwittingly"
41-1-2-3,That's a conservative estimate.
41-1-2-3-1,More of a Republican one
41-1-2-3-1-2,"The Republican estimate is everyone is a sucker but me. I don't know what the Big-C Conservative estimate would be, but probably similar."
41-1-2-3-1-2-1,That's why they love conspiracy theories. They're the only ones smart enough to connect the dots that lead to Soros and underground cannibal pedophile rings trafficking children out of he basement of a pizza place without a basement.Real hardcore IQ shit.
41-1-3,"They keep giving him millions of dollars. They gave him millions for the ""legal battle"" against the ""rigged election"" which magically vanished. Now he is fund raising for his next run and to help ""Save America."" It's a grift, which so many people are falling for he could easily win again."
41-1-5,"Gotta keep the grift going. As long as he doesn't ""officially"" announce that he's running, he gets to keep all the donations toward his ""campain"""

41-5-3-1-1,We're about to get screwed worse if the GQP gains control of anything else come Nov 6th
41-5-3-1-1-1,"Things are going swimmingly right now eh? How about vote in someone not ancient and who doesnt play wholesale us vs them games? Nah, the people will never go for it, instead we chill between rock and hardplace."
41-5-3-1-1-1-1,"Nobody is saying ""vote for Democrats because they're wonderful,"" the entire point is to vote for the least bad outcome while working to make better outcomes possible. Put another way, revolution is never going to be on the ballot, but you do get to affect the conditions under which that revolution has to occur. You can choose your enemy."
41-5-3-1-1-1-1-1,"Sure i began w a jab at the shit job right now, but over-all, lets not vote on someone a bajillion years old, trump included. Also, it is really apparent that a lot of people, again generally speaking, blindly vote for their team (that includes both parties). Im suggesting we stop doing that is all."
41-5-4,More screwed then what the current president is doing?
41-5-4-1,Literally yes. But you already knew that.
41-5-4-1-1,Lol what. Atleast trump knows where he is when he’s giving a speech
41-5-4-1-1-1,Inciting sedition?
41-5-4-1-1-1-1,I’d take someone that’s unhappy with the government situation then a senile creep
41-5-4-1-1-1-1-1,"No, you’d take a self admitted rapist, who paid hush money to a porn star that he fucked, who also incited an insurrection in which our highest halls of power were breached in an effort to disenfranchise the very basis of our democracy."
41-5-5,Vote Republican
41-5-5-1,If you want to censor education and control women's uteruses sure vote Republican
42,"Trump tried to flush documents down White House toilet, new photos show"
42-1,WTF? There are like 35 fireplaces in the White House and he flushes paper down the toilet?
42-1-1,Probably where he spends most of his time
42-1-1-1,There’s no way that diaper wearing diarrhea factory uses a toilet.
42-1-1-1-1,I believe it's on record that he would hide in the toilet to tweet because his staff kept trying to take his phone away from him to shut him up.
42-1-1-1-1-1,Power Move: Hiding from your subordinates so that they don't ground you from talking to your friends. I hope this tip goes in his 'POTUS FOR DUMMIES' book someone writes for him one day.
42-1-1-1-1-1-2,I'm sure Joe got an  advanced copy though.
42-1-1-1-1-1-2-2,At least you agree that Trump sucked. =)
42-1-1-1-1-1-3,Kinda sounds like Biden
42-1-1-1-1-2,"I'm now picturing the ""Covfefe"" tweet was accidentally sent during a scuffle in a bathroom doorway as the president, the chief of staff, and 4 interns all tried to gain control of the phone."
42-1-1-1-1-2-1,My personal theory is that he fell asleep in the middle of typing and accidentally hit send.
42-1-1-1-1-2-1-1,Tweeting with one hand while jamming government documents down the shitter with his other.
42-1-1-1-1-2-2,"*Was it covfefe? Yes, that's the right word. Trump thought as he was putting the finishing touches on a 45 minute bowel movement. The interns were beating on the door of the presidential bathroom but Trump could barely hear them as he rung his golden bell and Mike Pence crawled through the doggy door preparing to wipe Trump's ass with the flower petals he likes.*""Despite the negative press covfefe""*Trump said out loud as he sent the tweet, Mike Pence gingerly finishing his work with a smile on his face*"
42-1-1-1-1-3,"Damn, he runs from his responsibilities by hiding in the bathroom and playing on his phone? Maybe he and I aren’t so different…"
42-1-1-1-1-4,So he really was shitposting… damn.
42-1-1-1-3,"Fat guys on heart and blood pressure medicine with poor diets, who don’t drink alcohol are usually extremely constipated.I bet he takes Cephulac or something close to induce movements. lolHe looks constipated too."
42-1-2,He sought out privacy to hide his dirty deeds.   Not to mention now we know why he had to flush the toilet 10-15 times.
42-1-2-1,"Yeah, flushing the paper probably added 1-2 flushes to his usual 9-14."
42-1-3,"He was running the government by Twitter from there, anyway."
42-1-3-1,He was able to do insider trading by Twitter from there too.
42-1-4,"If I remember correctly, quite a few of those fireplaces are sealed off. But your point is still valid as the fireplaces in the residence are in full working order."
42-1-4-3,Somebody already tried lighting a fire in one of those fireplaces....
42-1-5,It’s because you don’t toss your drugs in the fire. He’s doing what he knows.
42-1-5-1,"This is it exactly. He’s flushed enough coke in his time to see the toilet as the “keep cops from arresting me” portal. In a crisis, habits kick in."
42-2,Now you know why he was so fixated on toilet bowl flushing power and about having to flush multiple times.
42-2-1,"One of the easiest ways to figure out what ""problem"" he is having at the moment is to see what trivial matter he is currently railing against during his bat-shit insane rallies."
42-2-1-1,All his crazy windmill rants were just cause he didn't want them near his golf course. That's all. It's that simple
42-2-1-1-1,Fuck I had no clue. To think he had me fooled that he might care about something that doesn't directly impact him.
42-2-1-1-2,I honestly thought this was Trump saying the shredders weren't shredding enough.
42-2-1-1-3,"He staggered while walking down a ramp because the lifts in his shoes keep him at a 75° angle to the ground. Hence the 20 minute long rant he went on just before the 2020 election about how steep ramps are these days, and how his generals always say how wonderfully brave he is for walking down them."
42-2-1-2,"The whole ""kneeling for the anthem"" thing was payback for the NFL shutting him out from a franchise.  I'm from Buffalo and was glad when he didn't have the winning bid at the time, as I was certain he would move the team downstate, but after the insanity of him being elected president, I would have gladly given up my beloved team for the good of our country.  I truly believe that had he have been an NFL owner, he wouldn't have cared about political ambitions.  He has always been the obnoxious guy at the party who nobody wants to hang with, so his presidency from his standpoint was strictly about settling old grievances."
42-2-1-2-1,"Oddly enough, if he'd gotten a NFL team, I think the NFL would have been able to reign him in way more than the US government ever could.  You can't cover up losing records or blame them on fake news. Scores are scores. The shit style of business he pursues would bankrupt a team so fast. If the NFL could get the Raiders coach canned over emails, and change the Washington team's mascot name, 45 wouldn't have lasted a season the way he runs his yap."
42-2-1-2-1-1,TFW the NFL Board of Directors has more enforcement power than the United States Legislative Branch.
42-2-1-2-1-1-1,"it really would have been a dream scenario. a bunch of NFL owners probably even voted for him, but in the world where he's never president, he never got the backing of millions of angry morons, so he'd just be another shitty businessman to them, easily disposed without consequence if he's fucking up the product and being detrimental to the league."
42-2-1-2-1-2,"I agree. Unfortunately he really wasn't a serious contender for the Bills because he would have had to proved his net worth, which was way less than the billions he was claiming.  Same thing he did as President, only now with all his grifting I'm sure he is.  He literally pulled off the greatest con in world history by becoming President.  His grandfather was a pimp from Germany that couldn't get back into that country, his father was a grifter who made his fortune convincing New Yorkers that gentrification was going to ruin the value of their homes and to move into his white dumpy neighborhoods, and the Donald himself is so morally vacuous that his first wife now lays in a pauper's grave at his country club for the tax breaks.  Can't wait for what's up with the kids, they signed off on giving their mom a shitty little grave site.  Voting or not voting for Trump really is a rohrschach test on whether you are a human being or not.  Or a Turing test, I guess."
42-2-1-3,"That's why I'm waiting for him to start calling Alex Jones' texts ""FAKE NEW!!"" before they're ever released."
42-2-1-3-1,Fox and all of them have been oddly silent about it. They know.
42-2-1-3-1-1,Yep. They seem to be obsessed with Brittany Griner this week for some reason...
42-2-1-3-1-1-1,">for some reason...Not sure what you mean by that, she's a black, gay woman that was ""busted for having cannabis oil in a vape cartridge"".She's everything they hate."
42-2-1-3-1-1-2,it's hard to imagine a reason they would Be so quickLy And narrowly Concerned with what normally would be an attacK on a us citizen by a foreign country while taking the side of the foreign country
42-2-1-3-1-1-2-2,don't forGet thAt the other countrY Wants tO get soMe Arms dealer back iNstead.
42-2-1-3-1-1-2-4,"It’s disgusting how people are slandering her. A blonde, blue-eyed Brittany would have a much different response and those assholes won’t even admit it.JuSt ObEy ThE lAw"
42-2-2,Makes perfect sense why he started randomly going off on toilets lmao
42-2-2-1,A particularly hilarious demonstration of the axiom about Republicans:Every accusation is a confession.
42-2-2-1-1,"I wish this wasn't so disgusting cause I would laugh at the comedy level absurdity of it all, but we still have a third of the country bending over for him at every single turn."
42-2-2-1-1-1,The presidency was literally a fucking Onion article when Trump was in office.
42-2-2-1-2,"For sure, just didn’t think he’d actually be that stupid lmao"
42-2-2-1-2-1,"Wrong. WRONG.We're talkin about Donald Trump, man.- Charlie Murphy (RIP)"
42-2-2-1-2-1-1,"""So I'as invited over to Pennsylvania Avenue, the Mueller report had *just* come out, Donald Trump was *the shit* man. And you know how they talk about celebrities having an aura? Well Donald Trump *had* one man, *I seen it!* It was *orange.*"""
42-2-2-1-2-1-1-1,">And you know how they talk about celebrities having an aura? Well Donald Trump had one man, I seen it! It was orange.""Oh shit.. He probably knows about that ""aura"" thing too. And this is why he spray tans himself to look like an oompa loompa. So he literally has light reflecting off him like this.Wasn't there a time that he was complaining about the color of lights also?"
42-2-2-1-2-1-2,I enjoyed your reference until it led to me discovering Charlie Murphy's dead.RIP :(
42-2-2-1-2-3,Turd boy’s stupidity is only outpaced by his arrogance…silver spoon entitled jackass
42-2-2-1-2-4,"There is no limit or end to stupidity. If you ever find yourself thinking “Surely they couldn’t be *that* stupid…” guess again. They can, and probably are."
42-2-2-1-2-5,"I did think he was that stupid. What convinced me was on one of those live televised newly appointed cabinet meetings. When Trump say to ""take the guns first, then ask questions..."" Then in less than 2 minutes the cabinet got Trump to say the polar opposite of what he just said.   And of course, all the other instances where Trump said anything with his mouth."
42-2-2-1-5,We legit need to start checking the basements of pizza places.
42-2-2-2,This whole time I thought it was because he took sloppy shits.
42-2-2-2-1,"“Sloppy shits” is Steve Bannon’s secret service code name. I know, it’s hard to keep it all straight ."
42-2-3,Here you go [
42-2-3-2,Goddamn I forgot how bad it was having him as president.
42-2-3-4,"JFC, I forgot about this (honest mistake and it was a firehouse of BS) but what the hell did I just watch? Holy shit- 70 million said “yep, that’s my dude”"
42-2-4,Easy to imagine the stupid fat fool putting ten sheets as a huge lump into toilet rather than ripping into smaller bits and then flush.
42-2-4-1,Can you imagine the scenario the LEAD UP to him doing that?was the shredder full? Out of official white house matches? Did the other people in the room know that was his plan when he left to use the washroom with the documents still in his tiny hands?
42-2-4-1-1,"Had some documents that outline crime he wants to commit.  Someone points out that could be evidence.  Staff has to have copies of everything cause he's the president.  Grabs papers and runs to the only place he can be alone, the bathroom."
42-2-4-1-1-1,Lol so they 100% know what he's doing and maybe chase after him like a dog that just grabbed a chicken bone? Bad mr president no crimes in the oval office!
42-3,"[Here] are the actual pictures.  Per [the source]:> @mikeallen> Trump’s telltale toilet … ⁦@maggieNYT⁩ obtained these photos ahead of the Oct. 4 publication of her book “Confidence Man”> Source tells her pic on the left shows a White House commodePic on the right is from a Trump overseas trip> 6:06 AM · Aug 8, 2022"
42-3-1,These revelations are ALWAYS right before the release of a book. It's really pissing me off.
42-3-1-1,"Just what I came here to comment on. Especially these pictures which are just pictures of a toilet. I’m not trying to contest the narrative, but the biggest reason I want information like this is so I have ammunition to use against the opposition. This “evidence” convinces no one who doesn’t already believe, so for the purposes I need it for this shit is useless. These articles read like a slam dunk and are anything but when it comes to the people that actually need to see it."
42-3-1-1-2,NOTHING will convince the people that are already in the cult. It maybe convinces people who are still in doubt.
42-3-1-1-2-1,"Trump could shit on their doorstep, and they would find a way to justify his actions.""The President had a bathroom emergency. I'm proud he chose my doorstep to shit on."""
42-3-1-1-2-3,"You're absolutely right, but these pictures wouldn't even move a sane, unaligned person."
42-3-1-1-4,"This looks really fishy to me.  I think Trump is a huge dumpster fire and glad to see him gone, but those pictures show nothing. In fact I think they're made up/planted.  Who tears up paper so neatly into nice rectangles? And who just leaves them there in a nice pile at the bottom of the toilet.  Maybe the toilet is clogged, but that doesn't look like a clogged toilet and that doesn't like a handful of paper that was thrown into a toilet.  I feel like this is an attempt at making money out of the Trump dumpster fire, but doesn't sound very credible."
42-3-2,Hilarious that you can see Stefanik and most likely Roger stone lol
42-3-2-4,What's to note is those names are written on the document during a foreign trip. Why is he talking about them on an international trip and with whom
42-3-4,Really curious to know who took the pictures. And why?
42-3-4-1,"Why? Because that’s a possible violation of federal law. Although the Executive enjoys presidential privilege over certain communications made while in office, it is not absolute and all work product ultimately belongs to the public.  He cannot discard official documents.  Especially possible incriminating documents."
42-4,No wonder he was complaining about low-flow toilets in the Whitehouse! What an idiot!
42-4-1,"From the same quote, Stable Genius: ""We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on -- and in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water...""Edit: 40% of Americans think this guy is smart and his conduct over those 5-6 years was acceptable... Crazy to think about, then I reflect on the dumbest 40% of my classmates through elementary, middle, and high school, then I'm like, oh, that makes sense."
42-4-1-1,I'm not even sure what the fuck he's trying to say here.
42-4-1-1-1,"He hates the planet, and low flow faucets.  If the water exists, it should be his to waste."
42-4-1-1-1-1,Thank you.  I appreciate the translation since I don't speak trump
42-4-1-1-1-1-1,"I am fairly good at understanding very broken English from non native speakers but God damn, I was lost until that guys translation, like he embellished it but I literally couldn't make sense what he was trying to say there before translation."
42-4-1-1-1-1-1-1,"I used to work with ONLY ESL people for years and years, German, Korean and Spanish, and Trump is still kind of hard to parse. I suppose the difference is that the ESL people are trying to convey ideas that actually make sense."
42-4-2,That the Preisdent basically has ever breath dowcumented had to completely infuriate a crook like Trump who absolutely depends on not leaving a paper trail for his scammy bull shit.
42-5,"*Americans need to flush 10, 15 times,* Trump said. Well, sure, if you're trying to destroy documents."
42-5-1,"The weird thing is the pic is from an overseas trip. I’m left wondering which country had the super toilets that were able to swallow all of his documents now. You just know that he had to be infuriated by someone else having a better toilet than him, golden or otherwise."
42-5-1-1,"When the president travels, they often poop in a specially provided toilet/set up so that their poop can't be analyzed by foreign governments.But maybe they let him flush documents in any old toilet?edit: it was satire! leaving it up as a testament of shame to others.But they really do guard the president's poop."
42-5-1-1-1,You know that’s satire right? They don’t make the president use a freaking portaloo lol.
43,"Trump is not 'man enough' to testify in Jan. 6 probe, Pelosi says"
43-1,I heard Ivanka say she would date anyone who testified before the J6 committee.
43-1-1,"Jesus, he would sell out Putin to get inside his daughter…"
43-1-1-1,I just had to suppress some vomit. Thanks.
43-1-1-1-1,I guarantee he still baths her
43-1-1-1-1-1,Bathes her in *what*?
43-1-1-1-1-1-2,cheeto smegma
43-1-1-1-1-1-2-1,Welp that enough reddit for a week
43-1-1-1-1-1-2-2,I played bass for Cheeto Smegma
43-2,Hillary testified for 11 hours. He couldn’t manage that. He’ll rant in public and on social media about how he’s being persecuted but make him swear to tell the truth and it’s 5th amendment time all the sudden. He never stand by anything he says. Lying sack of wet shit
43-2-1,"Also, she gave relevant, detailed testimony and didn't plead the fifth hundreds of times."
43-2-1-1,"Hey, remember that time that Trump said the only criminals plead the fifth. How many of his asshole cronies pled the fifth in a variety of different crimes"
43-2-1-1-1,Don’t get him for hypocrisy.  We’ll be here all week. Honestly I don’t think it even registers w him.
43-2-1-1-1-1,His moronic sycophants as well.
43-2-1-1-1-4,"It's not hypocrisy, it's the truth.  They're a bunch of criminals."
43-2-1-1-3,"Just his cronies? Have we forgotten that he himself did this 440 times in one sitting, two months ago?"
43-2-1-1-3-2,"thank you, saved me the trouble.. dude knows no limits, and you think he's going to crash and burn one day for it, but he never will. that will be his legacy. nixon has gerald ford to thank, trump did it with sheer self-willed brute force. and i do know what he's facing, but i also truly feel like our govt will never hold past presidents accountable. *something* will disallow it. it's the ultimate get out of jail trump card, so to speak. the term gains even more relevance the longer this guy remains merrily inhaling big macs"
43-2-3,"He doesn't even really rant in public. If anyone starts protesting or criticizing during his rants, Trump has them thrown out. Trump has lived in safe spaces his whole life."
43-2-3-1,"Yes, he’s just a big baby."
43-2-3-1-1,That’s part of the double meaning behind “Diaper Don”.
43-2-3-1-1-1,The other part being that he literally wears diapers.
43-3,Hillary testified under oath for 11 hours without pleading the 5th. I bet trump is too afraid and weak to even do 5 minutes.
43-3-1,She also attended Trump's inauguration after she lost the election to him.What did Trump do after he lost to Biden? Ran away like the little pussy he is.
43-3-1-1,"You’re insulting a vagina, try something less strong"
43-3-1-2,"Narcissists cannot lose.  They would rather destroy the world and to accept defeat.  At the latest Rally Trump still claims he won both elections.  And claims he won by a long shot in 2020.     I guess Trump wants to scrap the election process all together like Putin, Xi and Kim Jong-UN"
43-3-1-4,Umm he did a little more than run away. Trying to destroy democracy and overturn a legitimate election result were other things he did.
43-3-2,Imagine if she tweeted your exact words as a challenge?!
43-3-2-2,He would pretend to accept the challenge and then do what he always does...find a reason not to appear.  That is what Trump does.
43-3-3,Hillary has bigger balls than Trump.
43-3-3-1,Hers are so big she has to keep them on the inside.
43-3-3-4,Have you seen here recently.   Everything is bigger
43-3-3-4-1,Is she from Texas? I heard everything is bigger in Texas.  All I can think about now is a Cheesesteak now 
43-3-4,"Hilary testified for 11 hours w/o a single 5th. In 5 minutes, Trump will plead the 11th.  I’m not really joking."
43-3-4-3,"The summons specifically informed trump to let them know if he plans to plead the fifth on any of the issues they wish to speak about.I am relatively sure this is a formality. It sounds like they have enough information, testimony, digital tracks, and other evidence to know exactly what is going on. To the point where Trumps fifth would just be confirmation of their findings."
43-4,This is how you bait him.
43-4-1,"He will play the 'I want to testify, but my lawyers say no' card."
43-4-1-1,"""My Canadian supermodel girlfriend wanted to show up to my birthday but she had a last minute booking in Europe."""
43-4-1-1-1,"Her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancouver."
43-4-1-1-1-1,She cooks like my mother and sucks like a Hoover!
43-4-1-1-1-1-1,J Edgar?
43-4-1-1-1-1-2,It seems like some people haven't seen Avenue Q.
43-4-1-1-1-1-5,"So soon I'll be off to Alberta!....I mean Vancouver!....Shit, her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancouv- YES shes my girlfriend!My wonderful girlfriend!Yes I have a girlfriend, who lives in Canadaaaaaaa!"
43-4-1-1-4,She goes to another school
43-4-1-2,Perhaps. We’re talking about a guy who basically ran for president because people made fun of him at the correspondents dinner.
43-4-1-2-1,Would he never have run if this didn’t happen? This is gonna bug me
43-4-1-2-1-1,His successful campaign was his second one. His first time running for president was in 2000.
43-4-1-2-1-1-1,He was [putting the idea out there in 2011] as well
43-4-1-2-1-1-1-1,"He had been flirting with it ever since the 80’s, but no one took him seriously because he was making it stuff that only rich people really care about and had no shot. Then he started blaming immigrants and telling people that it was okay to be an asshole  and it caught on."
43-4-1-2-1-3,Wasn't it Seth Myers who pushed him over the edge?Pretty sure he was the host that year.
43-4-1-2-1-4,"I really do believe it would be a lot less likely. I think he was incredibly offended by that night and it really did drive him. It didn't keep him going. Once he gained the following, that did. But that night really did hurt him."
43-4-1-2-1-4-1,What a strong man he is. It really is impressive/s
43-4-1-2-3,"I don't buy this.  Obama made fun of Trump's birther conspiracy lies.  Trump was probably embarrassed in that moment, but he also attended the roast dinner hosted by the guy he had been lying about, so he must have expected something like what was said.I'm sure he had been thinking for some time about running for president being the ultimate grift, and his TV show was cancelled so why not? and he probably didn't think he would get the nomination, but when he did, he dug in against Hillary, and it's been reported he was surprised he won."
43-4-1-2-3-1,Not to mention all the help he could be to his buddy putin. Pretty sure he's been in Russia's pockets for a long time.
43-4-1-3,"'I cant Testify, I'm being audited by the IRS..'"
43-4-1-3-2,"It's not so sad if Trump said this because it's almost expected. His supporters will be the one parroting ""He can't testify since he's being audited by the IRS."" And that is sad."
43-4-1-5,"Mar-a-lardo is all bluster and pomp, but he knows what a weak, limp wrist, baby handed pansy he is. There is absolutely no way he will show up. It is hilarious when he's tried his stupid ""Pull"" handshake with anyone who is remotetly prepared, he can't move them even though he has like 40 kilos on them. He has the physical power of maybe two five year old girls put toghether and is about as agile as chrismas ham."
43-4-1-5-3,“Baby handed pansy” 
43-4-2,"Yes, but Pelosi knows he can't be baited into testifying.  He's too much of a coward.He can be baited into spewing bullshit excuses for why he can't testify, which will be used against him later."
43-4-2-1,Win win for Pelosi. Either baits him into testifying or really have him go off the rails.
43-4-2-1-1,In either case his 2024 position gets weaker
43-4-2-1-1-1,"He should be in jail and disqualifies from holding any office, for fucks sake, but yeah at least we can weaken his electoral prospects"
43-4-2-2,He's been subpoenad. He has to or go to jail like Bannon.And yes he can be baited. He can be baited in to doing anything.
43-4-2-2-1,Well that's off the table if MAGA (oh I meant to say the Republicans lol) take over the House in a little over two weeks. We've got to get out the sane vote people!
43-4-2-2-1-1,Even IF Republicans win the House they don’t take power till end of January 2023.
43-4-2-2-1-1-1,Trump can easily stall until then.
43-4-2-2-1-1-1-1,"Let him stall. Republicans aren’t taking the house. Pelosi came out this weekend with a public statement that she’s confident democrats will retain the house. Pelosi fund raises and counts votes on par with McConnell. She wouldn’t broadcast confidence unless her internal data was strong. Let the cowardly ex president delay. It hurts his 2024 prospects no matter what, and I’ve got time. Been using a treadmill. I’ve got every intention to outlive Trump’s delays. Throw another burger at the wall. It ain’t stopping the big dick of justice coming in hard and dry."
43-4-2-2-2,"He's never going to jail. House arrest, a distant maybe. He has lifetime secret service protection. How does that work in jail?"
43-4-2-2-2-1,Put the compromised secret service members in the jail cells next to him!
43-4-2-2-2-1-1,Brilliant.
43-4-2-2-2-4,Solitary confinement.
43-4-2-2-2-5,Him and Tony Ornato share a cell. Problem solved.
43-4-3,"And the thing is, she's right.It's always amusing, the degree to which a contingent of voters that outwardly places such outsized value on what they consider ""manliness"" united so emphatically on *such a complete fucking pussy*."
43-4-3-1,To be fair most of them are just as pathetic as Trump it's why they need to compensate
43-5,"Hillary needs to pitch in, mocking his low energy. She can last for 11 hours.We can do this."
44,Outtakes of Trump's Jan. 7 address to the nation
44-2,What I like is how he gets his squint ready and kinda hunkers down for each take.
44-2-1,Yea he's clearly playing a mild character here. It's both fascinating and unsettling to think about.
44-2-1-1,"Extremely unsettling. I think those of us on the left often find it easy to downplay many of his gaffes as a sign of pure senile imbecility a la the old man who sits on his porch in a rocking chair and watches his lawn all day long to ward off those pesky kids from taking his garbage cans. But this shows a much more self-aware man. I always thought he probably was more self-aware than he seemed at face value, but now I think even moreso than I thought before.Edit: There's SO many comments, I can't say I'll respond to any more. But thanks to anybody who has or will provided me with new info (or perspectives) on the matter. Godspeed in the elections"
44-2-1-1-1,"This is without doubt the most unique video I’ve seen of Trump in years, it’s like watching two different people in this video. I have no doubt now that he played a character as president, and that is absolutely crazy."
44-2-1-1-1-1,"For years I've been saying ""something happened to the man, he used to be very well spoken in the 90s/00s"" but it looks like he still is, he just *plays* a idiot on TV. I wonder if his character for the past 8 years was a preemptive defense, like he gets hauled in front of Congress where he produces an Alzheimer's/dementia diagnosis and shrugs his shoulders. *Everyone* would believe him because he ""exhibited"" a cognitive decline while in office. Either that or he really is a fucking idiot and we're reading into the video too much, he did admit to having trouble with the word ""yesterday""..."
44-2-1-1-1-1-1,"The reason he doesn’t like the word “yesterday” is bc when he removes that, that sentence can be interpreted in different ways. By saying “heinous attack on our country” instead of “heinous attack occurred yesterday” he is trying to sound like the actual attack on the country was when they stole the votes from him and he actually won. That’s the message he’s trying to give to the insurrectionists."
44-2-1-1-1-1-1-2,This is the answer I was looking for. Can’t believe how many people aren’t picking that up. I’ve never once seen or heard of Trump admitting he “has trouble” with anything. He’s purposefully changing the sentence to have a double meaning and he’s faking humility as a smokescreen so it’s harder to tell that he’s changing the message.
44-2-1-1-1-1-1-3,"He has always been good at doublespeak. The way he words his messages have always allowed for some plausible deniability when you look at just the words he uses, but he knows exactly how it will be perceived to his followers. You can follow his pattern from his first campaign when he “joked” that he would pay legal bills for anyone who attacks the press and then lo and behold his rallies and events became more violent."
44-2-1-1-1-1-2,"But admitting and joking that he's struggling with a simple word is extremely self aware for a man who seemed to have no concept of what ""self aware"" even was. It's ALMOST humanizing really"
44-2-1-1-1-1-2-1,This video is the only time I've ever seen a recording of Trump as president that humanised him and shows him being genuine and that disgusts me because of the implications that has towards how intentionally malicious and performative his character had been.The bit where he can't see the teleprompter clearly and squints and gets it wrong and openly admits such is like whiplash compared to the bullshit he spewed publicly.
44-2-1-1-1-1-3,"I thought the same, he changed so much that it really did seem like a cognitive decline, until now. Idk about that, if I was told about this video but didn’t see it, I’d say as much. Seeing how his persona changes, mannerisms, and more so him directing, it’s very different from an idiot bumbling their way through a transcript.I hope he really is a fucking idiot, otherwise god knows what damage he has done behind closed doors in the white house."
44-2-1-1-1-1-3-1,"There are different kinds of intelligence. I think he is a very stupid man when it comes to history, civics, business, human kindness, civil rights... But I think he is a fairly shrewd manipulator. Closer to an actor than a business man. So I think it's fair to think that some of his weird mannerisms are an act, but there is a very insecure, very stupid man underneath"
44-2-1-1-1-1-3-3,"For a while I thought he had changed too, but then I read a little about his history.  Throughout his private life he has been a complete dirtbag.  He has a public personality and a private one.  I think his public personality and his private personality have slowly merged over the years and are now closer than ever before.According to his first wife he ""allegedly"" beat and raped her after ripping her hair out and then later she ""allegedly"" recanted after receiving a huge settlement.  He was also ""allegedly"" super racist to tenants over the years.  There are lots of stories like this.He seems to know right from wrong and used to try to hide the criminal things he has done, but now as his power increases, the more he gets away with, he seems to feel like it isn't as important to hide his illegal behavior."
44-2-1-1-1-1-5,"it's not that he's an idiot, it's that he's diverting every last braincell to furthering his narcissistic tendencies, so he gives 0 fucks if it sounds stupid to you or I as long as it sounds good to him and makes him think he's the most important and the best and etc etc"
44-2-1-1-2,The Woodward tapes showed he has a different opinion on topics than he gives to the public but uses these to divide the nation. It seems like he doesn’t reveal his own opinion but the opinions that’ll help his personal goals first.
44-2-1-1-2-1,Trump ‘s opinions change based on the last person he spoke to
44-2-1-1-2-1-1,You're missing the point. They change based on what is good for Trump. He's much more calculated than liberals perceived or wanted him to be.
44-2-1-1-2-1-1-2,"Which is frankly terrifying. In a calculating manner, this man spouted rhetoric designed specifically to be divisive, harmful, and racist. He did it for years. He did not do it, because he believes it. He did it all, because it was good for Trump. He played the character he needed to be to energize his base and be as popular as he could."
44-2-1-1-3,You don’t achieve what he did without some sort of talent. His specific talent is as a brander / communicator - knowing the exact way to own the narrative at all times. He’s history’s greatest snake oil salesman.
44-2-1-1-3-2,"Kind of, but his real talent is shamelessness. There's so much a person can do when you're incapable of feeling embarrassment. Combine his shamelessness with an unparalleled narcissism, and you have an arch supervillain."
44-2-1-1-3-2-2,Don't forget his dad's money  The three things that make Donald Trump are -1. Other people's money2. A complete lack of morality / integrity 3. Ego
44-2-1-3,"Yeah the thing that is so interesting is how lucid and clearly he speaks/comments on what he's saying, it's not rambling or reptitiive it's like a normal person. He is clearly analytic of the way he's presenting himself and picks up on minor details quickly. it really demonstrates how his whole persona is very calculated and constructed."
44-2-1-3-1,"He has said some very, very strange things though. Some of the long winded, bizarre ramblings cannot have been planned. He doesn’t drink. I wonder if he has an opioid problem. Limbaugh did, and hid it for decades."
44-2-1-3-1-1,"Nah, he doesn't have an opioid problem. And I believe that he doesn't drink or smoke. But coke, on the other hand... lmfao. If you've ever known a coke addict, you can tell, Trump is very clearly a coke addict and has been for quite some time now."
44-3,I would like all of the Trump outtakes please.
44-3-1,"I listened to a Penn Juliette podcast appearance talking about his time on The Apprentice. He says they’d have to sit and watch Trump ramble for hours on the “boardroom” set to get a few minutes of usable footage. Maybe someone at NBC is sitting on the motherlode right now.Edit: Penn Jillette, thanks autocorrect."
44-3-1-1,"I remember seeing Penn Jillette talk about his time with Trump on that show. The main point he tried to get across was that it’s all completely fake, the boardroom is a set, nothing about the show is real. But the part that stuck with me was when he said that Trump has literally no sense of humor. None. He doesn’t make jokes and he doesn’t understand them either. The only kind of humor Trump understands and finds funny is calling someone fat or stupid etc. He finds making people feel small funny, he finds people being mocked or embarrassed funny. But if you make a joke you have to use your brain to understand and make work, Trump just plain doesn’t understand it and he will get angry if you make a joke and he doesn’t understand it. From how Jillette made it sound, Trump is single digits intelligence."
44-3-1-2,"It's rumored that they have footage of Trump dropping the N-bomb talking about black contestants, but Mark Burnett will never let it get released."
44-3-1-2-1,Trump sues everyone.  Mark just doesn’t want to deal with the hassle and the inevitable “Mark’s a loser.  I don’t even know him.  He begged to come be my pool boy at Mar-A-Lago.”
44-3-1-2-1-2,Mark is super religious along with his wife Roma Downey. He probably is happy with all the judges he got seated and with the overturning of Roe. Wouldn’t turn on a friend.
44-3-1-2-1-3,Let him get sued. We’ll run a go fund me to pay the fees. As long as the video gets out.
44-3-1-2-1-3-1,It wouldn’t matter if we heard him be a racist pig his supporters and republicans wouldn’t care. It’s already common knowledge.
44-3-1-2-1-3-1-4,That’s the scary part. The man can do what he wants and they’ll still back him. It’s like a cult.
44-3-1-2-1-4,Mark Burnett is a christofascist like all the others who control Trump.
44-3-1-3,mark burnett is one of several folks with kompromat on trump 
44-3-1-3-1,"Dude fuck The Apprentice outtakes. And fuck this video we’re all commenting on too. What I want to see are the outtakes from his “We love you, you’re very special” video he put out while the attack was going on. If *that’s* the best version they came up with, I can’t imagine what else he said."
44-3-1-3-1-1,"There were a few of those shown in last night’s hearing. Watching the hearings live vs. reading about them the next day is a dramatically different experience. It’s akin to watching Hamilton live on Broadway vs. reading the summary. Once the hearings get going (which admittedly can take 10 minutes or so), they are riveting. It’s so damning to hear nearly 100% conservative/Republican witnesses make the case against Trump. Highly recommend!"
44-3-1-3-1-1-1,I’ve watched them all except for last nights and I always tell my coworkers about them lol. I say it’s my favorite show and I’m sad that it’s the season finale.
44-3-1-3-1-1-1-1,> the season finaleSeason 2 in September
44-3-2,The dude’s hand and neck movements seem like something you’d get if you put a drunk raccoon inside a mechanized person suit
44-3-2-1,Some kind of Edgar suit. 
44-3-2-1-1,Sugar water
44-3-2-1-2,"""Egger!"""
44-4,>Yesterday's a hard word for me
44-4-1,Stable genius
44-4-1-1,"Person, woman, man, camera, TV"
44-4-1-1-1,"I hate Trump and I think Biden is old… but the amount of difficulty that Trump has when speaking, walking down a ramp, or drinking water, is miles beyond any Biden gaffes…"
44-4-1-1-1-1, What the fuck are Trump supporters going on about with Biden being too old? Biden and Trump are only 3 years apart!
44-4-1-1-1-1-1,Have you not seen how Republicans act?They won't shut up about Biden son when Trumps kids are signing billion dollar deals with the Saudis.
44-4-1-1-1-1-1-2,Ooooo the evil communist saudis who massacred that ONE guy.
44-4-1-1-1-1-2,"I hate Trump… the idea that people in their late 70’s or 80’s shouldn’t be running a country isn’t partisan. As if the system wasn’t undemocratic enough, but the DNC and RNC put up the candidates they want. Once it gets to the general election stage it’s a choice between a turd and a shit sandwich."
44-4-1-1-1-1-2-4,There are things called primaries.
44-4-1-1-1-1-2-5,"I believe the voters chose Biden because they wanted someone who could win against trump, and they were right.  But Biden cannot run again at his age, and the orange shitstain should be in jail of course."
44-4-1-1-1-2,"What the hell are you on about? Trump has the best words, he speaks greatly with his hhhyuuuge hands. He's also an amazing athlete, he's won golf tournaments. You're just a liberal, commy, socialist member of antifa who hates America. Go back to your shit hole country and build a wall behind you.Edit: oops, I forgot to add /s. Don't want MAGATS confusing me for a comrade."
44-4-1-1-1-3,"Right? Biden can at least ride a bike, and if you're a religious nut Biden actually attends church literally as often as possible. That means shitall to me, but a lot of people vote for people that are explicitly christian/religious and trump is absolutely not in any way. He has probably spent less than 12 hours in a church over his nearly 80 years on this planet. And most of those trips were likely when he was a child and it was against his will + the small amount of time he spent trying to look religious for photo shoots. It's absolutely boggling that anyone could argue that he's religious with all of his trespasses and blatant contradictions."
44-4-1-1-1-3-3,"and the lord said unto adam, grab her by thee pussy"
44-4-1-1-1-3-4,"Dude, Trump doesn’t need to go to church because he is literally Jesus, if you were a loyal member of the cult of MAGA you would know this."
44-4-4,I have to wonder if it was the word or the concept of “yesterday” where he was a traitor to his country.
44-4-4-1,He just wanted to say “the attack” not “the attack yesterday” because the first option allows his supporters to fill in their own meaning. If he just says “the attack” that could still refer to the big lie that the election was stolen.
44-4-4-1-1,"Bingo bongo. He was super careful with his words and the ones he was angry about were obvious, like how he couldn't say the votes.He's a narcissist that believes in his own entitlement to think he should never lose something. He's a bratty child masquerading as an adult."
51,A part of me is worried Trump will get away with it all
51-1,"I’d start with why he’s even allowed to file anything in that court…he Judge-shopped and no other civilian in the state of Florida would be allowed to do that.  They’d have their case redirected to the court it was initiated in, faster than they filed it.  This is bullshit from square one."
51-1-1,Exactly.  And judge shopped to a judge he appointed and is clearly biased (she's a part of the federalist society).
51-1-1-1,Appointed AFTER he had already lost the election and was already lying about it being stolen.
51-1-1-2,Name a conservative judge that isn’t?
51-1-1-2-1,I mean another one of his appointees signed the warrant for the search right?
51-1-1-3,"Y’all’s entire Supreme Court is packed with his handmaids. Doesn’t matter which court he’s in, it’ll end up in the Supreme Court as he appeals.I’m so sick of this shit, your country is fucked and it’s destroying accountability and integrity around the world. What your corrupt politicians and judges are now allowing will continue to permeate through the western world who are ALSO watching this unfold, and applying learnings of “there were zero consequences for that crime” to their own politics. Disgrace."
51-1-1-3-1,"Our government has been unraveling for decades, it’s just reaching critical mass in terms of its’ blatant fuckery-ness.  Greed is a helluva drug."
51-1-2,Square one? This is like square 100 billion in the Bad Timeline we are on since Trump came around
51-1-2-1,"My biggest question is always ..... how the hell someone like Trump has so much power over everyone. The guy is not the wealthiest, not trustworthy, nothing redeeming about him, not intelligent and not that good at much. It's a display more of the American nation rather than of the man if an entire country can be wrapped up in one ugly person like this."
51-1-4,"Keep in mind when he became president, appointing federal judges was his top priority! This judge was appointed by, you guessed it, the orange turd."
51-2,"This buys him a couple of months.  Gets him to after the midterms, where he announces 2024 run. If GOP takes back the house, more hearings and delays.  Some “defund the FBI” theater. Then some “let the voters decide in Nov 2024” bullshit. Then he’s either the president again or some other GOP Trumpkin, and he gets pardoned or pardons himself.  Vote like your country depends on it."
51-2-1,"Everyone needs to get out to vote.  I really believe if we don't win the next two elections big, Republicans will use that time to completely dismantle any real democratic process left within the country."
51-2-1-1,"100%. What Biden did in his last speech was smart. He identified democrats, independents, and mainstream republicans as a voting block. This block easily accounts for 65%+ of all voting age people. Easily enough to destroy any anti-democratic, conspiracy-believing nut job from the maga extreme block. Democrats need to be smart about how to best unite this group. Ideas?"
51-2-1-1-1,Make Election Day a holiday
51-2-1-1-1-1,Also ranked choice voting in every state
51-2-1-1-2,"Focus on the working class. People making less than $125,000 per year."
51-2-1-1-2-1,"It's crazy to me that 125K is working class.  I know sime trades get you there, but that used to be a REAL high pay rate."
51-2-1-1-2-1-4,"Working class=/= lower class. There are only 2 classes, working class and owner class. Working class is anyone who makes their money by selling their time. That's everyone from grocery store baggers to doctors. We should all be on one team regardless of how much we make. (Although people who make more tend to forget that)"
51-2-1-1-2-2,I roughly make 54k and live paycheck to paycheck. Glad my 2000 rav4 is still tickin. A car payment would kill me
51-2-1-1-2-3,125k is still working class in high COL cities. You can't support a family on it in some places.
51-2-1-1-2-3-5,Come on. Yes you can.
51-2-1-1-2-4,"This is the only answer. These democrats need to stop playing and let Bernie unite the ppl. Deal with the repercussions later we need worker unity and ppl unity only way to fight against unchecked oligarchy, theocracy, fascism and hyper capitalism."
51-2-1-1-2-4-1,"In a way, Bernie has united the people. Sadly, he'll never see the white house, but the mere existence of his presidential candidacy has emboldened moderate democrats to do smaller versions of his reforms in order to appease the left. Joe Biden would never have done student debt relief if Bernie hadn't pushed for it. Bernie put progressives on the map in a big way."
51-2-1-1-2-4-1-2,"Bernie was one of the main reasons i re-registered as a Democrat after 25 years as a Republican. I’m not 100% down with his agenda, but it’s a far sight better than the extreme right agenda.  Plus, Bernie has been totally consistent with his message and truly believes in and works towards what he says, every other candidate just lies and panders to the flavor of the month. What I really want is a charismatic moderate, 50-55 any race, any gender."
51-2-1-1-2-4-2,"I think Bernie's too leftist to be the forefront of an anti-maga group, someone like Sherrod Brown should be the symbol instead, or heck just keep Biden."
51-2-1-1-2-4-2-1,"Great thing polling and actual numbers is far better than feelings. And since he is polling above biden currently and always has, I’d rather put it to the polls. I’ve known die hard republicans who were ready to vote for him both times."
51-2-1-1-2-4-3,Bernie is so not a unifying figure. Biden is far more centrist and is a viable choice for many more folks.
51-2-1-1-2-4-4,I like Sanders. He has integrity. But FFS come the fuck on his own supports didn’t even show up for the guy. He’s not winning a general. He can’t even convince democrats. It’s fucking delusional to think Sanders is unifying when republicans labeled Biden and Obama evil “socialists.” An ACTUAL socialist? GTFO.
51-2-1-1-5,"Wait, mainstream republicans aren't MAGA republicans? I live in an the urban center of an overwhelmingly red state and it seems like most republicans are thin blue line-wearing Trumpees with Let's Go Brandon stickers on their pick-up trucks."
51-2-1-4,"Even if Democrats controlled all 3. House, Senate and Presidency. I still don’t think they will do anything to him. They would just keep dragging this out. I have a better chance of going on a date with Taylor Swift. Than Trump being charged with anything."
51-2-1-4-1,She does need to start on her next album...
51-2-1-4-2,"It's not up to the Democrats.Biden can't arrest Trump anymore than Trump could arrest Hilary Clinton.All Biden can do is stop the GOP from sabotaging the law long enough for the system to do its work.While I would love for the FBI to just go arrest Trump right now, the system is just not there yet.Wishing it would go faster won't make it. And the GOP have enough power to throw wrenches in the system and slow things down.Americans have to vote these crazy MAGA Republicans out of power for good."
51-2-1-4-2-1,"OR the system is just fundamentally broken and Trump becomes the next Putin when heh ""wins"" the 2024 election and America becomes the next Russia."
51-2-1-4-2-1-1,"Not broken, but mismanaged and unbalanced, which means you need overwhelming and decisive victory."
51-2-1-4-2-2,The problem is why is people letting GOP to throw wrenches at its own country system… everyone should be pointing at this
51-2-1-4-2-3,"Well they already claimed they wouldn't do anything to him until after the election, which should be a sign of trouble right there. I don't get what this is something afforded to Trump but not other people."
51-2-1-4-2-3-1,>I don't get what this is something afforded to Trump but not other people.Really? You don't? What other people are former Presidents with a huge following that's already legitimately breached the US Capitol?
51-2-1-4-2-3-1-1,My point is that when Hillary ran they did her investigation right before the election. I don't get why someone who was favored to win and actually has some ground to stand on gets that treatment and Trump gets to have the FBI and DOJ give him more time to think of ways to gum up the system.
51-2-1-4-4,"Not true. They essentially *have* *no* *choice* but *to* *charge* *and* *convict* *him*! If they don't its lights out for any remaking vestiges of democracy that still remain, and it's the only path forward with any hope whatsoever to begin making this an actual democracy for the first time in far too long."
51-2-1-4-4-1,"But will they do it ? I mean SCOTUS is corrupted and biased, the judge who gave the ''Special Master'' shit is corrupt and biased, why would the DOJ be the beacon of light ? Im in the same boat, Trump will absoluty never face any consequences for this. The FBI raided his home and found boxes of top secret documents, yet the guy still make appearance daily and make hateful speech without a single bat of an eye, the dude WILL BE allowed to run the in the 2024 ballots and WILL run for president in 2024... Which is insane, cause this guy should be banned from even working at Home Depot. The so called ''Vestiges of democracy'' are long gone my friend... (cough Gerrymandering cough)..."
51-2-2,"Serious question, how much a delay can this even give him? Given FBI is already sorted through all the documents.Second question have they picked the special master and how do they do that?"
51-2-2-1,From what I've read today the ruling is very vague.
51-2-2-1-1,"Can it be appealed, would it even be worth it at this point?"
51-2-2-1-1-1,Yes. But it will next go to a fairly conservative court.
51-2-2-1-1-2,I've read some say appealing would drag this out much longer.
51-2-2-1-2,"This isn’t her jurisdiction therefore her ruling should be thrown out. Also there is nobody that they can provide that wouldn’t already be at the doj that has the credentials to look at those documents in the first place. Lastly, screw this entire thing, they need to stop playing cops and robbers at this point. Let them revolt."
51-2-4,But that's what he's been doing for a long time.  Who's to say he won't be able to find a way to delay it for another few months again?  And it seems they've been doing it on everything.  Every single person who speaks tried to delay as much as possible.  Has Lindsey graham even gone to court yet?
51-2-4-1,"At this point I’m hoping for a full-Elvis, and throws a clot on the toilet. I’d even accept rumors he’s still alive and impersonators at car dealership openings if we could make that happen."
51-2-4-1-1,"If Trump dies, all the investigations and proceedings will stop and the disgrace won't stick. He needs to live to see the consequences of his actions in order for any semblance of rule of law to remain."
51-2-4-1-1-1,The worst that's going to happen to him is the Feds give him a plea deal and Trump throws everyone under the bus and he walks
51-3,Please tell me again how this is not the act of a fascist organization?
51-3-1,Please tell me again why he is continually allowed to get away with it?
51-3-1-1,Please tell me why no steps have been taken to replace these corrupt judges
51-3-1-1-2,Because there's no actual majority of rational politicians.The only majority is the business interests who merely want a controlled burn of rights
51-3-1-1-2-3,That's not why... it's because Dems need 2/3s of the Senate to recall these judges.
51-3-1-2,He appointed that judge.
51-3-1-2-1,The real answer is that if you got impeached twice and stage a coup any judge you appointed should come up for review.
51-3-1-2-1-1,"The real answer is that in a sane and properly functioning society, circus clowns like Trump, this joke of a judge, and all the MAGAt politicians would get laughed out of the room long before they were even remotely close to being in position to hold office. Since we have a banana republic clown show, we get garbage."
51-3-1-4,This!!!! How has this guy lived his *entire* life with sociopathic impunity?
51-3-1-4-1,It’s like no matter what he gets away with everything and he knows it. It’s so disappointing.
51-3-3,"It openly is, but too many people in this country are infatuated with their stupid ideas of a strongman and scared by anything not white and Christian to see what is going on."
51-3-5,"Why don't you make your best arguments for how, precisely, the appointment of a special master equates to fascism?"
51-3-5-1,"It's very simple: an ex-president can't invoke executive privilege because they are no longer the executive. He took secret documents belonging to the government and when asked for them back he hid them until we came and got them.  Now he's demanding the documents back on the basis of executive privilege... and the judge he appointed is making his case for him.  It's possible you could make the (extremely hard to believe) claim he didn't understand the rules about secret documents.  Or you could make the claim we can't charge him for taking them because of some legal technicality.  But they're arguing we have to give back what he stole because *they're his.*  This is like a bank robber claiming ""finders keepers.""  The fact he was able to find a judge that would pervert the law in such a way shows how deep the judicial rot goes.And as Prof. Jason Stanley, author of How Fascism Works, said regarding this ruling: ""Once you have the courts you can pretty much do whatever you want."""
51-3-5-1-1,"Whether you believe Trump will ultimately prevail on the executive privilege claim, the question is hardly settled.   Moreover, there is the attorney client privilege at issue as well as questions about whether documents or items have evidentiary value.    The court hasn't rules on any of those issues.     The ruling appointing a special master is just a step to allow for such questions to be considered before the documents are released back to the DOJ.    Meanwhile, they can still be reviewed for security concerns.  It's not nearly as ominous as some seem to think."
51-3-5-1-1-1,"> Whether you believe Trump will ultimately prevail on the executive privilege claim, the question is hardly settled. Executive Privilege isn’t some post-presidential privilege that allows Presidents to keep documents after they leave office. At most it would mean these are Executive documents that must be returned to the National Archives.  You understand that, right?  No president can just claim ""mine!"" and keep things in their possession when they leave office.  These are government documents owned by the government.  And more importantly: HE. IS. NOT. THE. EXECUTIVE! He does not have executive privilege! He can't order things to be kept secret from the public so he can do the job because *he doesn't have the fucking job*. I shouldn't have to explain this. A FORMER president can't exert executive privilege to stop a CURRENT president from doing his job, and it's insane to even argue it's possible one could."
51-3-5-1-1-1-1,If you read the order you will find that the judge very calmly set forth statements from Supreme Court decisions indicating the law is not settled on the issue of executive privilege.    She didn't even need to use all caps one time.
51-3-5-2,I could care less wether or not a special master is allowed to be appointed the concern with this ruling is the length at which this judges oversteps her ruling for my posted statement below.The part of her judgment that is the most concerning is her ascertainment that executive privilege was to be allowed in determining wether or not the documents were to be covered by privilege. She then goes on to state a very fraudulent claim that Tump is to be covered by executive privilege and that the sitting president has no standing on revoking said privilege.
51-4,He will not stop committing crimes until he is stopped by the justice system.
51-4-1,"Oh, the justice system he also corrupted? The justice system that did fuck all while he danced on government norms? The justice system that took 18 months to do something about his coup, and then he undid their progress within a week? That justice system?"
51-4-1-1,"The fucker literally. And I do mean *literally* was defying the Constitution from the very instant he was sworn in. He was still taking money from domestic and foreign businesses. He never divested. Constantly violating the emoluments clause. He should have just been immediately arrested after being sworn in. He has done so much fucking shit out in the open, publicly, on TV, that would have gotten anyone into court nearly immediately. We're just fucking stupid."
51-4-1-1-1,Couldn’t agree more
51-4-1-2,"You mean the justice system that is in his back pocket, that he sat on everyday?"
51-5,"The focus should be one keeping him away from becoming president again, no matter what. Because if he does become president again, he wont leave until he dies or he brings the entire country to total ruin."
51-5-1,And winning the upcoming elections.  Republicans need to understand that these policies and actions are extremely unpopular.  Everyone please vote in November.  Check if you are registered to vote now.
51-5-1-1,Republicans have shown repeatedly: you don't have to win on the playing field if you own the refs.
51-5-1-1-1,"Per Biden's plan tacitly laid out in his speech, we need to convince moderate Republicans that they actually have more in common with us than with the extreme right. One step is to stop referring to these psychos as 'Republicans' (I know, we have a lot of anger at the enablers who got us here, but it's do or die now). They're Trumpists, MAGA crowd, extreme right, etc., just anything to split their voting block."
51-5-2,">does become president __again__ (emphasis mine)We voted him in once, we're absolutely capable of doing it again. Sooo many people *still* want a second term, some even want a ""President Forever,"" despite it being an obviously terrible idea. I'm out of hope but still looking East."
51-5-2-1,We're absolutely capable of voting against him a second time. The question isn't about the votes but about whether or not they'll matter by then. The SC is ready to declare that state legislatures can unilaterally declare the outcome of a state election as they see fit. A repeat of 2020 would be a Trump win.
51-5-3,I don't think people realize death is the consequence if he is reelected/MAGA Republicans gain more power. There will be mass murder/genocide/torture in this country if that happens. That's what happens when dictators get power.
51-5-3-2,Everyone should be getting armed
51-5-4,"Not just Trump. At this point, any Republican president will be a serious threat to democracy. The MAGAts control the party and Trump controls the MAGAts."
53,Trump told advisors last year he'd return Mar-a-Lago files in exchange for 'sensitive' documents about the FBI probe of his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia: NYT
53-1,18 U.S. Code § 610 - Coercion of political activity sounds like it fits pretty good
53-1-1,The shoe definitely fits
53-1-1-1,Can we deliver the shoe like an Iraqi Journalist would to Dubya?
53-1-1-1-1,W dodged that like a champ.  Horrible President though.
53-1-1-1-1-4,The best moment of his entire 8 year presidency. In fact the only one that wasn't awful.Edit: I forgot about the failed escape from the press because the door was locked. That was pretty good too!
53-1-1-1-1-4-2,He shoulda let it hit him. He deserved at least that much. Now he paints shitty pictures and gets rehabilitated by a mindless press.
53-1-1-1-1-4-2-1,At least he isn’t racist…there’s that. And Michelle Obama likes him. Shitty president but he has those two things going for him. Supposed to have a good sense of humor. Still shitty president.
53-1-1-1-2,You mean George W Bush right?
53-1-1-1-2-2,Dubya was fast man he just flexed
53-1-1-1-2-2-1,All that running in the Texas ANG while he was avoiding Nam came in handy.
53-1-2,Trump's broken more laws than can be written on the stacks of classified documents he stole.
53-1-2-1,"Let me know when he's in jail. I saw his traitorous ass blow through Arizona this afternoon. Unfortunately, I was the only one I saw out there with a ""Lock Him Up"" sign (the soccer field parking lot, couldn't get into the event)."
53-1-2-1-1, Thank you for your fine work at the parking lot on behalf of all us not brainwashed by F*x “News.”
53-1-2-1-1-2,"Which ""news"" outlet has you brainwashed?"
53-1-2-1-2,"> Let me know when he's in jail.If he’s ever convicted, I’m expecting house arrest with limited internet, which means no rallies … which pretty much also means no Trump. There’s not a lot of current policy to study on how a former president with a permanent security detail can be imprisoned in a federal or state facility."
53-1-2-1-2-1,"Build a separate facility for him, it'd be a good jobs/public works program."
53-1-2-1-2-1-4,And make him pay for it.
53-1-2-1-2-2,"I believe precedence for national security risk prisoners actually says he'd have to be committed to ADX Florence, the US's hardest supermax confinement. He'd probably receive plenty of leniencies due to age and the technically non-violent nature of his crimes, but we don't have any other facility able to accommodate someone of such a profile and risk. Given the inherent issues of keeping a former president in the serial killer fridge though, he'd probably just receive house arrest with communication and visitor restrictions, and a 24/7 guard with monitoring."
53-1-2-1-2-4,I have a feeling he would commit suicide before even going to jail if convicted.
53-1-2-1-2-4-1,"He might ""commit suicide"", but he would never kill himself.  He's too much of a narcissist to imagine a world without himself."
53-1-2-1-2-4-2,"> I have a feeling he would commit ...It’s weird. On the one hand, he has all the cowardice required to avoid accountability.  But that means he also lacks the courage to acknowledge his accountability and full commit to that ending."
53-1-2-1-3,About how many people showed up to the event to support Trump?
53-1-2-1-3-1,"All the deluded ones. My basis for that comment is that I have held security and secret clearances and anyone who thinks it's okay to just keep those in your home is obviously not understanding their importance.However, if you want a number, it was difficult to see who was there for him or not since there were also several soccer games going on. It's a large athletic complex. I'm sure all the aerial photos will show all the vehicles as ""his supporters"" There was a dirt driveway going to the building he was speaking at (more of a structure) and when they saw my sign and what I wrote on my car they stopped me from walking any further."
53-1-2-2,When is he going to face any consequences though?  May as well just keep breaking laws.
53-1-2-2-1,"> When is he going to face any consequences though? May as well just keep breaking laws.When prosecutors are absolutely certain that they can indict a former president, without his escaping conviction by a unanimous trial jury … and not one moment earlier.  There is no way on earth that they want to have that blowhard go free after they take their best shot."
53-1-2-2-1-1,"Sorry, I had to post again after posting above... The problem the Democrats have is that they keep striving for absolute, unchallengeable, perfection. We've been through this with his impeachment(s) and every other action started locally and nationally.Get your smartest minds on it, take action, and then deal with that whatever song and dance he wants to come up with.I'd be more generous with my evaluation if I actually saw any results after hearing years and years of ""we're gonna get him""Something like handcuffs or the bars of a cell...?Let me also remind you that this inability to hold him accountable in a timely manner has now resulted in the loss of the Supreme Court, Roe v Wade, and the Voting Rights Act...Oh and January 6th, where the mastermind himself has so far escaped any responsibility...But don't worry you'll get him after his second term (for life), right???"
53-1-2-2-1-1-2,"One of the problems here is that trial jury. He received 46.8% of the popular vote in 2020. Do you think any of those folks are going to vote to convict him? People who saw him pissing and shitting on the nation's laws for 4 years and still voted for him anyway?To convict it has to be unanimous. We can't even get a *judge* who's unbiased, getting 12 out of 12 jurors who think he belongs in prison is going to **require** unchallengable perfection.And it still may not be enough. The people still in the Trump camp don't care about reality, let alone evidence."
53-1-2-2-1-1-2-1,"> getting 12 out of 12 jurors who think he belongs in prison is going to require unchallengable perfection.No it won't.It literally does not matter what you present. You could have the roof of the court house rip off, Jesus himself descend from the heavens and say ""yeah that dude is guilty as shit"" AND NOBODY'S MIND WOULD CHANGE."
53-1-2-2-1-2,This or they’re waiting for him to shit himself to death
53-1-2-2-1-2-1,On a diet of pure McDonald’s you’d think that would have happened already…
53-1-2-2-1-2-2,"> This or they’re waiting for him to shit himself to deathYep, I can actually imagine Trump making an Elvis-like departure."
53-1-2-2-1-4,"They're going to have a hard time convicting him, because there is almost guaranteed to be at least one die-hard MAGA asshat on the jury, that will just flat out refuse to convict no matter what. A hung jury, even if it's 11-1 for conviction works perfectly for Trump. He'll claim he was exonerated."
53-1-2-3,"In size 6 Arial font, with no margins."
53-1-2-4,"No not true, he still has security clearances. Many former government officials retain them"
53-1-2-5,"Hmmm, more quid pro quo? I guess Trump hasn’t learned his lesson, eh, Susan Collins?"
53-1-4,"Well, didn't it really start with theft of government property? All of those files belong to the government, not him."
53-1-5,Quid pro quo?
53-1-5-1,"Quid pro quo usually refers to a trade of equal value, and is not always inherently illegal.Trump was trying to trade something that wasn't his back to it's owner for even more sensitive information.  It was one-sided to say the least, and NARA was unwilling to trade, and more importantly, did not trade.So not Quid pro quo"
53-1-5-1-1,"Yep, calling it quid pro quo is the same mistake we made in the first impeachment trial. It's an academic term that doesn't mean anything to the average layperson, and even when you explain waht it means-- ""this for that""-- it sounds rather harmless.Blackmail. The word we should be using is ""blackmail""."
53-1-5-1-1-1,IIRC blackmail is a specific type of extortion where you're threatening to reveal evidence of another party's wrongdoings unless they do what you want. This would just fall under extortion generally.
53-1-5-2,"Nah, calling it quid pro quo is the same mistake we made in the first impeachment trial. It's an academic term that doesn't mean anything to the average layperson, and even when you explain waht it means-- ""this for that""-- it sounds rather harmless.Blackmail. The word we should be using is ""blackmail""."
53-2,It's hard to think of anything more illegal than that.
53-2-1,"He was... planning to extort the US government, to cease an investigation into interference in our elections, by implying that he'd ~~seek~~ sell them if we didn't cooperate?And he did this while living on US soil, and protected by club bouncers?Why is he not on a watch-list? Is there an intelligence requirement for being labeled a criminal terrorist?"
53-2-1-1,"Oh, he's probably on several watch lists. Would be shocked if the CIA doesn't have him surveilled like it's The Truman Show."
53-2-1-1-2,"Trump has literally always been on several watch lists. You think the FBI, CIA, Homeland security, NSA, Etc. hasn’t been on his ass for years? You think they weren’t tracking him when he was running for *and* acting president of the United States? The fact that people seem to *always* forget that, “It’s a big club and you ain’t in it” has and will always be true when it comes to high level corruption is baffling to me."
53-2-1-1-2-1,I mean clearly not that much if he was able to jsut wall out with extra top secret documents.
53-2-1-1-2-1-1,Yeah - this is what I don’t get
53-2-1-1-2-1-1-1,Secret Service was watching 45 take the documents but probably too enamored with him to report it
53-2-1-2,Watch-list? Fucker is so dumb all you would have to do is tell him people that people that don't steal top secret documents are poor and not good at business deals. And he would admit everything within the hour!
53-2-1-2-1,"""Mr. President! You don't mean you *never* stolen Top secret documents to coerce the US state!? Wow, I'm sorry Mr. President I'm just shocked - Everyone has done it! The only people that heaven't are poor and not cool so I don't mean to suggest you are poor and not cool but what if other people heard about this! :0 """

53-2-2-2-1-3,"I really wish it was an understatement, or a falsity.People think I wanted to believe the former president was an obvious Russian asset, like it is something I wanted to happen--and it couldn't be further from the truth.It's heartbreaking it did happen, and that so many refuse to see the obvious truth, and instead idolize this man who is one of the single greatest dangers to the US in its existence.What a mind boggling timeline we are in..."
53-2-4,"Former high ranking government offical gets removed from his post and steals classified documents (potentially containing nuclear secrets of either the US or one of our allies) on his way out, hiding them at his home in a closet with no security beyond the equivalent of a bike lock. He proceeds to ignore reasonable calls for the return of aforementioned documents for over a year while at the same time trying to blackmail the government into trading the secret documents he stole for documents that potentially implicate him in a crime. How is this person not arrested yet?"
53-3,"Blackmailing the US government. Not a person, just whole ass government agency.Bold strategy Cotton, let's see how this plays out."

53-3-1-1-1,"I’ll give you Goldmember, you give me a transfer to a regular prison so that I can be with my beloved Mini Me."
53-3-2,"Well, it seems to have been working for him so far. Which is disgusting"
53-3-2-2,There is no doubt in my mind that he will face absolutely zero legal repercussions for this. Our country is fucked.
53-3-2-2-1,"Nah nah, it's all about to go down! He broke the law!"
53-3-2-2-2,"I agree. My faith in humanity will be restored if he is eliminated entirely. No martyrs. No legacy. No revenge. Nothing. Even his kids lose all the property & fortune & have to go into private sector for what it’s worth. Anything besides a total annihilation of that monster of an old fart, means he will continue this shit, in this country or another, till his dying day. Him & other rich fucks remotely like him, need to be dealt with, if this country will ever recover from the damage his kind does. I have no love for anything related to him."
53-3-3,since he's still free and talking shit I think it's paying off ok for him
53-4,stealing top secret/sci/sap classified information to blackmail the US government seems like a bad idea.
53-4-1,"You would think, but it's working for him so far."
53-4-1-1,"Like seriously. Why should anyone in power obey any law? It's not like he's gonna go to jail, or face any kind of punitive action. Fuckers about to be installed as King after the midterms."
53-4-1-1-1,"It only works for him because he captured a part of the population that didn't vote before, and now they do vote, Republican. He only maintains the support of those in power to keep the Despicables voting red. Whatever keeps them in power is the ONLY thing that matters, so they can keep the grift going."
53-4-1-1-1-1,I am really surprised nobody deep into the CIA clandestine culture didn't have him assassinated very obviously already as the shit he stole likely had to expose some of their shit. You'd think they would want to send a message to traitorous wannabes.
53-4-1-1-1-1-1,The bad guys don't get assassinated in the US.
53-4-1-1-1-1-1-1,"Sadly, you’re right. Otherwise Stone would have been gone in the Nixon era."
53-4-2,"Seems like it, but as far as we've seen this fool is immune to consequences."
53-4-5,Every single thing he does is transactional and done to help himself without any regard whatsoever for anyone else. It’s all the man can do.
53-5,"Yes, because the U.S. Government loves to negotiate with terrorists."
53-5-1,And traitors of course.
53-5-2,they did when he was president.
53-5-2-1,That's part of why he don't work there no more.
54,"'Unfit for the Bench': Trump-Appointed Judge Orders Halt to DOJ Review of Seized Materials | ""This judge is now an active participant in Trump's crimes,"" said one critic."
54-1,I really hope they appeal.  They can't let Trump co-conspirators hijack every investigation of him.  Just imagine what the future will look like if a president knows they are untouchable forever.

54-1-1-1-1-1,We already had Trump. We're clearly not that lucky.
54-1-1-1-1-1-1,Peoples willing denial of reality is what allows it to happen.  That's why democrats never vote

54-1-2-1,"They already finished their review of the documents, they had more than ample time to do it. And they probably have alot more than that with them.The DOJ can always appeal this, Garlands knew what he was getting into with this. They're more than capable of fighting this battle, even if headlines like this don't make it seem like it."

54-1-2-1-1-5,Don't read this if you want to stay cool.
54-1-2-1-1-5-1,"I actually read a newer thread, a lot of legal experts are saying this judges action will probably get struck down as it's really unusual. So the Tl;DR is: the judge could have appointed a master + allowed the investigation to go on. Because she didn't it's really peculiar and looks strongly like she is favoring Trump. We'll have to see."
54-2,">Cannon, ruled that Trump ""faces an unquantifiable potential harm by way of improper disclosure of sensitive information to the public"" if the review of the materials, which included documents marked ""confidential"" and ""top secret"" continues.So the documents, that trump stole and stored in an insecure area of his country club, are SO top secret that even identifying the EXTENT of Trump's crimes would cause a national security problem.Sounds like a good reason for him to already be in a jail cell for his treason"
54-2-1,Is this not unlike those rich white college kids that can’t go to prison for rape because it would be too hard for them?
54-2-1-1,You talking about kids like Brock turner?

54-2-1-1-4-2,"Allen Turner, the rapist formerly known as Brock."
54-2-1-2,"They have such promise, you wouldn't waste it by having them face consequences would you?"
54-2-1-2-1,Then what's Trump's excuse?
54-2-1-2-1-1,"What part of ""~~rich and white~~"" **promise** are you not getting?"
54-2-2,"> faces an unquantifiable potential harm by way of improper disclosure of sensitive information to the publicYeah, but so does the United States. Can't a higher judge tell her to shove it up her ass?"
54-2-2-1,"Yes, it goes to the 11th Circuit next, where a 3 judge panel will review the ruling.  It could then be heard en banc by the entire 11th Circuit, or appealed to the Supreme Court."
54-2-2-1-2,"So delay, delay, delay…It could have been avoided if this was addressed as it should have been instead of Trump again getting leniency."
54-2-2-1-2-1,"But in true Trump fashion, him lying to get out of trouble opens him up from more trouble."
54-2-2-1-2-2,"AGAIN.How many court cases (civil/criminal/congressional) has this fucking guy been involved in throughout the last 7 years (at least) that drag out longer than 2-3 years? By the time anything significant comes of it, we're onto the next 10 batshit crazy stories that came out. And still absolutely no consequences other than minor monetary inconveniences. Classic tactic, no good direct outcome, so let's kick the can as long as possible."
54-2-2-2,Exactly. The 'potential harm' to one man should not outweigh the potential harm to an entire country.
54-2-2-2-1,I'm gonna bite here because I'm not quite sure you understand the topic. What is the potential harm a Special Master poses to the country?
54-2-4,"Federalist Society, she is a member. They veted and picked 43 of 50 some judges Trump selected. Including supreme court , and her court. She works for him. Was recommended to him by a place that she is a member. He hired her. Conflict, direct conflict."
54-2-4-1,The Federalist Society is a terrorist organization.
54-2-4-1-1,"Totally agree!  I just wish the dems had a similar, but obviously less evil, branch of their own."
54-2-4-1-2,"Everyone repeat it everywhere.The Federalist society is a cohesive, fascist-domestic terrorist organization working to actively undermine the US government and US democracy, putting the entire planet in jeopardy."
54-2-5,She sounds like a sycophant
54-3,this blatant conflict of interest is INFURIATING.
54-3-1,"Lets stop calling it conflict of interest, and start calling it a quid pro quo.She committed a crime in order to help him commit his crime.In the words of a fucking idiot she's in love with, ""lock her up."""
54-3-2,So is this going be appealed and if not since there is a law that Congress passed that overturns her bullshit reason can they simply tell her to go get fucked by sending her the law that Congress passed? She basically ruled on a president set during Nixon that was later fixed by Congress when they passed a law protecting documents in the White House. So her argument is crap. Also a private person should be allowed to view documents some label super fucking top secret.  No way this can stand. Her opinion that Trump being able to legally acuse Biden of stealing election is also fucked up.
54-3-2-3,It might take longer to appeal the ruling.  The SM might burn a month but an appeal could easily drag into several months. We will find out tomorrow.
54-3-2-3-1,"A special master could burn more than month by appealing over the choice, the list, the qualifications, etc"
54-3-2-3-1-1,"The FBI likely had a large group handling the review.  A single special master could take much longer for the review.  Alternatively, they could bring in others to assist, but then each assistant would presumably have to get approval of the FBI, Trump's team, and the judge.  What a mess this judge and Trump have created."
54-3-2-3-1-1-3,Purposefully created mess.
54-3-2-3-1-1-3-1,"Correct this is the plan. Everything is timing. We all know he is guilty. The question is how, and what law has he most broken that is worth going after him for. Because of his undeserved stature of being an ex president it is complicated."
54-3-2-5,"It can be appealed.   It will go through the eleventh circuit, and either way wind up before the entire body.  Most of them are trump or bush appointees.  Then since Thomas is the presiding justice, it will be up to him to slow the arguments before the supreme court or not.The fact that details are not known but the broad strokes are.  Since the espionage act doesn't care much about the specifics of the secrets you stole just that you stole them makes most of what the special master is going to adjudicate on moot.Additionally this won't stop them from getting other search warrants for everything else.  Her other opinions are without value as they aren't pertinent to the question at hand."
54-3-2-5-1,They should just skip the appeal and fucking charge trump with a crime.   Like today. Charge trump with withholding classified documents.   Contrary to popular belief you can charge him with more crimes later.   This whole trial is about trump getting his shit back.   He hasn’t been charged with anything. That’s how you end this shit - trump is committing so many crimes the DOJ can’t keep up.   How about you charge him with the ones you have. Throw in obstruction of justice for these documents but also for the fucking mueller report that’s mostly expired now but I think hope they filed a secret extension.
54-3-3,Honestly- is anyone surprised? This was expected. Shame but it was.  So much corruption ugh
54-3-3-2,I’m hoping the DOJ saw this coming and has been working on a counterattack (for lack of a better word). But who the fuck knows. This is blatant corruption of the hugest magnitude.
54-3-4,Can she not get disbarred for this? She's still technically a lawyer of the district so couldn't the bar simply revoke her license for blatant conflict of interest?
54-3-4-1,"There's no conflict under any bar rule, or any other ethics rule, in any jurisdiction anywhere in the country that I'm aware of.   So no, she probably can't be disbarred for this."
54-3-4-1-1,"You mean she can't be disbarred for ruling on a case she *explicitly* had no jurisdiction on?I feel like that *has* to be a sanctionable offense. There is no argument whatsoever that she has jurisdiction to hear this case in the first place, and the PRA is very explicit that all challenges are to be heard in the DC courts.This is the very definition of a activist judge, because she has decided that her opinions carry more weight than explicit codified law."
54-3-4-1-1-1,"What do you mean by ""explicitly""?"
54-3-4-1-1-1-2,"I mean, ""Explicitly"".From [44 USC ch22]:>§2204. (e) The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction over any action initiated by the former President asserting that a determination made by the Archivist violates the former President's rights or privileges."
54-3-4-1-2,"The clear conflict is that she was appointed by Trump. She owes him and she's clearly ruling in favor. She should have recused herself and sent the case to a non-Trump appointee if she could not separate her personal bias from her work as judge, which is blindingly apparent."
54-3-4-1-2-1,"She ""owes him"" according to what, you?  What happens if she doesn't pay the debt?"
54-3-4-1-2-1-1,It's really cute to see you up and down this thread doing everything you can to defend your God Emperor
54-3-4-1-3,That's surprising considering she's showing blatant disregard for the rule of law.
54-4,Trump appointed. Federalist Society member. I don’t think anything more needs to be said.
54-4-1,"Except, that judge is not a judge of law, but a stamp of intent from wishes.  The judge should be impeached as soon as possible."
54-4-1-3,"It will never happen, and this is a reminder to all the “we finally got him” crowed: trump is not as dumb as he’d like you to think he is.He is the most successful crime boss in history, with half the system “bought” by him, including so many judges, plus a Supreme Court majority. The scarier thing will be to find out how many MAGA loyalist are in the US army - which I’m afraid we might find out soon.—P.S. (edit):Even if trump ever goes away, we need to remember the tens of millions of MAGA heads are not going anywhere. The country is fucked."
54-4-1-3-1,"No, trump is THAT dumb, if not dumber. This wasn’t his idea, obviously. It’s whatever cronies haven’t jumped ship."
54-4-1-3-1-1,Trump was taught how to protect himself and his assets early on by his dads cronies. He took the advice and ran with it. With the help of Deutsch Bank he has built up enough payoff money to create multiple fire walls to protect himself from ever serving time in prison. You will never get him. He will live out his days doing what he wants and that includes a possible return to the White House in 2024. If he gets that nomination laws will change to keep his family there for at least 3 generations.
54-4-1-3-1-1-2,"He will be in court for the rest of his life, just from what he has done the past 5 years. He can still go to jail for writing a hush money check from his campaign funds in 2016 lol... That's just 1 thing. If a cop follows you for 30 miles, he will find a reason to pull you over. If you get pulled over enough, you will be arrested for something. Sooner or later something will stick. You think he has so much money to get out of all the trouble. You know how many billionaires in NY that will never rest until he is taken down? He is not that smart. He held a press conference at the 4 seasons.... Lawn care company. When they realized they made the mistake They still had a fucking press conference in front of the 4 seasons lawn care company!!!"
54-4-1-3-1-1-2-1,He will hire the people who hire people who hire people to find the dirt on his adversaries to put THEM in prison…. Or give them the hush money to walk away saying “not enough evidence”.Look at all of the lawyers that defended or went up against him who ultimately went to prison. Everybody has a price and he has a bottomless pit of $$$ to pay off whoever he can to get to his antagonist’s.
54-4-1-3-2,He is absolutely as dumb as we think he is. It just shows how incredibly corrupt and stacked in favor of the rich and famous (and powerful conservatives) our system is that he can commit countless crimes in the dumbest ways and avoid consequences.
54-4-2,Appointed after he lost the election to a jurisdiction that overseas mar a lago. And she randomly got assigned his frivolous lawsuit out of the 30 judges in that district court?
54-4-2-1,"The article references [a tweet by a political scientist] that indicates Trump's lawyers specifically sought her out. By not recusing herself, it's possible obstruction of justice and grounds for impeachment and removal from the bench."
54-4-2-1-1,"Yep, and we know that’ll never happen."
54-4-2-1-1-1,"The further we get from these recent revelations of Trump’s actions, the less faith I have that an indictment will occur. It’s scary times."
54-4-2-1-1-1-1,"2023: special master is still conducting a review. Would you believe how many documents there are to go thru??2024: Trump isn't running, but pursuing this case further will be seen as political, and we must remain neutral, so case is suspended until after the election.2025: well wouldn't you know it, after many years of thorough investigation, ron desantis's doj found no wrongdoing on Trump's behalf. In fact, ronnie himself is stepping down to let Trump serve his rightful 2020 kaga term."
54-4-2-1-1-1-1-1,Absolutely no way Trump's ego would let him play second to anyone else even if it was part of some scheme that will eventually put him in charge eventually.Heck he would probably be okay with everyone saying he's in charge but him not actually being in charge of anything.
54-4-2-1-1-1-1-2,You honestly think republicans stand a chance in another elections they shot there own foot it’s gonna be sweeping loses for years
54-4-2-1-1-1-1-3,2024...  Mr. Trump wins the presidency again and all is good.  
54-4-2-1-1-1-2,"That's how I've been feeling. Like before you know it 2024 campaign will be in full force, and...  *Aww shucks I guess we don't want to be too anti-democratic if the man is running for office. Well, since we live in a fair democracy, I suppose it's best to wait for the election to happen.*  \*Trump is elected in an actually-stolen election\*  *Well, we'll have to give it another shot when we get power back in 12 or 16 years.*"
54-4-2-3,> overseas mar a lagoCan we put Mar-A-Lago overseas somewhere?  Like at the exact center of the Sahara?
54-4-2-3-1,"Not thinking bold enough, yeet it into the sun."
54-4-3,"Trump appointed means something, sure, but only 21 senators voted against her confirmation, and 12 Democrats voted in favor. This was not some 51-49er like I expected to see.[Source]"
54-4-3-1,Her very limited experience for such an important posting pales in comparison to the absolute dreck many other nominees were.
54-4-5,"Modern day America. Sorry guys, you fucked it. Fascism will take over, it will infest the rest of the democratic and free West and our Grandparents died in World War 2 for nothing. Literally nothing when their kids want us to be Nazi's."
54-4-5-1,God damn this is so depressing
54-4-5-1-1,Pretty much my mantra every single day since 2014 when I see Trumps name in the news. Fucking hell.
54-5,"Imagine….    DOJ: Here are the myriad of steps, processes and attempts to gather these documents. Here is the timeline of events. Here is the lack of the Trump team cooperation. Here is the Trump team lying to the US government. Here is individual #1 running around on social media and television changing his excuse by the hour that he did these things (ipso facto admitting he did them). Here is the structure to the case we are building.    Trump legal team: yeah but… cmon. Show us your case against us.    Judge (who said ahead of time she would): I’m siding with the person who got me hired. Also… you guys gotta stop investigating until ~~my boss~~ the defense catches up."
55,"Donald Trump ""caught in repeated lies"" during deposition—attorney"
55-1,"In his deposition, Trump actually said that E Jean Caroll said she ""liked"" being raped by Trump in an interview with Anderson Cooper. Wallace then played the interview and (shockingly) Caroll said no such thing."
55-1-1,"remember at the start of mythbusters when adam savage would say ""i reject your reality and substitute my own""? trump does that in real time and is way, way dumber."
55-2,"I would've be more surprised if it was > Donald Trump ""caught telling the truth"" during deposition"
55-2-1,Honestly he is a pathological liar. He is incapable of telling the truth.Like I'm sure if you ask him what he had for lunch he's going to say a salad even though it was a burger and ice cream.
55-2-1-1,"A burger has lettuce, so that makes it a salad."
55-2-1-1-1,"it’s a salad-to-go.  you use the non-crispy croutons to hold the vegetables, cheese, and optional protein so that you can eat the salad with one hand and no fork."
55-2-1-1-1-1,"And a salad is just a very immobile, inconvenient sandwich"
55-2-1-1-1-1-1,An Inconvenient Sandwich - the documentary we all really need
55-2-1-1-1-1-1-1,"From the presidential brought you ‘Well technically a Burger has a salad in it,’ comes Pickles and Prejudice."
55-2-1-2,"I actually have to disagree. Not that he isn't a pathological liar, but that he's incapable of telling the truth.What people need to understand about Trump is that he is perpetually ""working the room"" - even if ""the room"" is one person. He's an absolute narcissist who is desperate for praise.What that means is, he will always try to puff himself up to impress. He is always looking to tell his ""audience"" something that will gain him praise.More often than not, that means he'll make shit up. But it also means he will tell people the truth - even if it is, say, *highly classified shit or secrets he's not supposed to share*.He needs that constant validation. He also needs to cover his ass and will bullshit if he thinks he's in trouble. But again, if he's in favorable company? He'll actively brag about his criminality. It really is whatever he thinks will benefit him in the moment."
55-2-1-2-1,"The toddler act gets really annoying by age 6, let alone over age 70"
55-2-1-2-1-1,"""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different.""- Donald J. Trump"
55-2-1-2-1-1-1,I was literally gonna bring this quote up. God there's really a quote for everything.
55-2-1-2-2,So he's a compulsive liar.
55-2-1-2-2-1,"Yes, he lies constantly.But the point is that his narcissism is the primary factor. Whether he lies or tells the truth can generally be predicted based on whatever best serves his need for praise/validation.He practically admitted to rape just to be able to say E. Jean Carroll had a good time with him. He would rather admit to a crime than risk people thinking he might not be sexually competent (as gross as that is to even utter).It doesn't excuse the lies, and it's not a good thing, but having a decent theory about when he'll lie and when he'll tell the truth is still useful."
55-2-1-2-3,It's also why he can't admit he lost the election. That would be ego death. The killing of his own mind. There's no way he can do it.
55-2-1-2-4,"He is a prototypical salesman with white shoes and sans-a-belt slacks.  He is a pretty good salesman, he can sell a pretty shitty product to a remarkably large amount of people.  And he understands what a lot of people don't:  you dont have to convince everyone to buy your product, and your product doesn't even have to make sense.  There are remarkably few downsides that matter  for lying and fraud.  And a percentage of the population responds positively to bluster and puffery no matter who is delivering it."
55-2-1-4,"I'm not sure he's incapable.  I think he simply doesn't care if something is true or not.  He cares about what serves his purpose and makes him look good.  On the rare occasions where the truth fits that requirement, I'm sure he'll use it, without any acknowledgement of the momentous event :)"
55-2-1-5,"That's not the entire story, it's weirder than that. It's like he's both a pathological liar, but also a pathological teller of the truth. The truth side comes out rarely, but when he goes off-script he has a history of saying really damaging things for no reason. He'd be a more stable character if he were only lying."
55-2-2,That would imply that his lips did not move.
55-2-5,For real…if he’s talking he’s lying
55-3,Only in his deposition?    The only thing the man has *never* lied about in his life is being erotically attracted to his own daughter.
55-3-1,"Didn't his lawyers try to get him out of testimony on the grounds that he is ""fundamentally incapable of being truthful"" or something to that effect?"
55-3-1-1,His own lawyers literally argued to Mueller's team that he should not be required to testify because his lying is so out of control that it qualifis as a mental disability.

55-3-1-1-1-1-1-4,"Smart narcissists go into business, the dumb ones into politics."
55-3-1-1-1-1-1-5,you'd think that.  But his supporters can use  his stupidity as an excuse of why he is not narcissistic+evil... effectively making him plenty more dangerous.
55-3-1-1-2,"And this is the absolute turd millions of our neighbors, coworkers, even friends and family put into the highest office in the country, capable of making decisions that influence the whole world."
55-3-1-1-2-1,"Not only put into the highest office in the country, but they also put him on a damn pedestal, build gold statues of him, have parades in his name, hang his banner all over their houses/lawns/cars/boats and in many cases, will put their belief and defense of him over their own family."
55-3-1-1-2-1-1,It's a cult it's a cult it's a cult!
55-3-1-1-3,"Thank goodness for the GOP for being such an inclusive employer, or else these ~~serial liars~~ *reality-challenged* would never find employment."

55-3-1-1-4-1-1,"> had warned Trump he would be “fitted for an orange jumpsuit” if he were ever to actually sit down with Mueller’s team for a real interview.So not ""try to get him out of testimony"" but rather that his own attorney allegedly warned him that he can't tell the truth."
55-3-1-1-4-1-1-1,"He belongs in an Orange jumpsuit, prison or mental facility or Gitmo...really doesn’t matter which...10 years ought to do it..."
55-3-1-1-4-1-2,That's his lawyer telling him that he's so damaged he can't sit for a deposition without perjuring himself. That is entirely different than arguing that he should be given accommodations for that.
55-3-1-1-4-1-2-1,I have no idea how this doesn't disqualify him from being president. How can he both be so incompetent he can't through a legal proceeding without lying but somehow is competent enough to lead the entire country.
55-3-1-1-5,"Hi, I need this to share.  Is it hard to find a source for this?"
55-3-1-2,"During the Mueller investigation his lawyers argued he could not testify because doing so would reveal to the world how stupid he really was and thus would constitute a national security crisis.**EDIT**:  I'm not being hyperbolic.  That is quite literally, almost verbatim, [what is former lawyer John Dowd told Robert Mueller & team]"
55-3-1-3,Which ones? The lawyers who had a policy that no single lawyer could ever meet with him because he lies so much they needed witnesses to every interaction?

55-3-5,"I think this is interesting because up till now I thought the narrative that the donald that shows up at legal proceedings was a different donald than the lying ""says what he base wants to hear"" donald that we saw at rallies and in during his presidency. The fact that this is being reported might be indicative that he really cannot keep his lies straight or tell the difference between reality and what he claims is true."
55-3-5-1,"I don't think ""true"" and ""false"" are meaningful categories for him, and it's one of his greatest strengths, in the sense of getting him what he wants. If you recognize true and false as categories, you recognize when you're lying, and people who are lying often have tells, seem awkward, try to keep lies plausible, feel obliged to stay consistent, etc. DJT's superpower as a persuader is that he doesn't care if what he's saying is true or false or whether it's contradicting something he said thirty seconds ago. He shows absolute confidence in what he's saying even when it's absolute gibberish, and he's so sure that what he's saying is absolutely right in the moment he's saying it that he's convincing. Most people genuinely can't pull that off. He's an extremely gifted con man."
55-3-5-1-1,"that's the thing, in the past this was something he could willingly ""turn off"" when it was time for under-oath court proceedings and that might no longer be the case for him."
55-3-5-1-1-1,"This and its parent comment are very interesting ideas. I think you guys are right, tbh."
55-4,"He also basically admitted to raping Jean Caroll. From WaPo:““She actually indicated that she loved it. Okay?” Trump said in the deposition. “In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn’t she? She said it was very sexy to be raped.”Kaplan then asked: “So, sir, I just want to confirm: It’s your testimony that E. Jean Carroll said that she loved being sexually assaulted by you?”And Trump answered: “Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper, I believe that’s what took place.”"
55-4-1,How stupid is he?
55-4-1-1,"Extremely stupid. Just when you think he can’t be any more stupid, he opens his mouth and proves you wrong all over again."
55-4-1-1-1,"His presidency was exactly like that for me, every other day I would be astonished all over again."
55-4-1-1-1-1,"I'm still astonished daily by his followers. There are still millions of people believing his daily nonsense... despite literally 50,000+ lies since he took office in 2016."
55-4-1-1-1-2,"> His presidency was exactly like that for me, every other day I would be astonished all over again.Right, and whenever you think there's no way he can top previous ridiculous insane lie, he somehow finds a way to outdo himself.I came to this thread thinking ""har har, DJT lying, that's not even news!""Then I read the top comment in the thread and almost puked.

55-4-1-2-1,"A lot of bad things happened, like repeated business failures, but he started with a huge amount of money, and his father bailed him out at least once.    I think, when all the investigations are finished, it will be clear that Trump was also somehow involved in some organized crime stuff. [Trump’s NY mob ties.]. Also Googling [“Trump money laundering” brings back almost too much, spread over a very long time.] He also has a very long history of simply not paying people who work for him."
55-4-1-3,"His ego can't handle not bragging about things, even how good he is at rape. It's batshit insane, and the fact we let this man run roughshod over the country for four years after a lifetime of grifting one of our biggest cities and he's *still* getting away with crap and on the loose doing god knows what is... well, we should be ashamed. At that point can we even claim to be a functioning first world government?"
55-4-1-3-1,"His voters excepted him from every single values and ethics test they hurl at Democrats and liberals for one reason: they connected with his hate.As long as he keeps ""owning the libs"" his supporters will let him run roughshod over the Constitution.I mean that figuratively and literally. I think they would find a way to blame Obama for Trump riding a horse with nails protruding from its shoes over an original copy of the US Constitution and ripping it to pulpy shreds."
55-4-1-4,He got into a public argument with NOAA about the direction of a hurricane. I'm not sure there is a bottom to his stupidity or lack of decency.

55-4-2-1,Yup. And then the deposing attorney put it on record to clarify what he meant and he still said “I believe that’s what took place.”
55-4-2-1-1,If he believed what took place was rape isn't that enough evidence to convict him? It's basically a confession.
55-4-5,"It would be a real pity if that was sufficient to take another look at his other 25+ sexual assault allegations, including his and Epstein's rape of a 13 year old in the mid 90s."
55-4-5-1,"I find it baffling that Trump has a well documented past with Epstein & Co. and the Q conspiracy nuts continue to see him as the hero that will bring an end to a global pedophilic cabal of elites. He has been photographed with Epstein, has stated in an interview that Epstein is a ""terrific guy"", wished Ghislaine Maxwell good luck multiple times as she was being investigated, and has appeared on the Epstein flight logs numerous times. It's crazy that they find it easier to believe all that is deepfaked or fake news, etc."

56-2,"Until November tenth for the committee to reply? What exactly does this mean? What’s the purpose of the block, what determines weather the block stays, and how long does it actually last?"
56-2-1,My guess is to get past the election November 8 without them being released. This court is corrupt as fuck and doesn't seem to care about showing it anymore.

56-2-1-2-1,The point isn’t to wait for a new congress. The point is to not reveal damning evidence against conservatives before a super important election
56-2-1-2-1-1,You know at this point I'm pretty sure Trump's financial records could show he was directly funding the war in Ukraine and single handedly responsible for world hunger and his base would not care one bit

56-3-2-1,"Its not on our doorstep. It is in our living room. Republicans have not won the popular vote for more than a decade, yet control many houses and senates in the USA. They are a minority party in a pretty dramatic way. In order to ""win"" an election, they only need to get about 44% of the vote, due to things like gerrymandering, and, well, corrupt courts, like SCOTUS."
56-3-2-1-1,They haven’t won the popular vote without an incumbent since 1988 IIRC and bush won it in 04 only because he jerked off the fears of 9/11.
56-3-2-1-1-1,"Yup. They are 100% a minority party, and they know it, which is why getting rid of democracy is not a problem for them. They only retain power by diminishing democracy, and increasingly advocate for violence in their attempts to do so.  This is one of the reasons I have said for years that the 2-party system in the USA needs to be done away with."
56-3-2-3,*in Hunter S. Thompson voice* tell me about the fucking next step
56-3-4,>So what's the fucking issue that required the SCOTUS to step in here?Party before country.
56-4,Of course they did.

56-4-1-1,"""It's his private information and that shouldn't be public!"" From the party that demanded a presidents birt certificate and then said it wasn't valid and demanded the long form one then said it was fake."
56-4-1-1-1,"How is that private information, it’s filed with the IRS, IT SHOULD BE ACCESSED VIA FOIA… the only thing pulled from that should be  Social Security numbers.It’s like if I go into court and say my testimony should be considered truthful, however it should be kept private."
56-4-1-1-4,"No you see trump wants to give us his tax returns, he’s simply under audit and can’t. After all, he said so and why would he lie?  Sure he’s actively suing for years and now making emergency appeals to the Supreme Court to stop that, but that doesn’t mean he’s lying to us. Trump is a good person and my friend and a patriot, he would never lie about this. Because if he did it would mean my entire worldview is shattered"
56-4-1-3,"""We have a plan for addressing this that's quicker than just waiting for these justices to retire"" - not the Biden Administration"
56-4-1-3-1,Leak it.
56-4-1-3-1-1,Exactly. How many people behind the scenes have already seen this and it has yet to have been leaked. Maybe once his nomination comes through it’ll see the light of day.
56-4-1-3-1-2,A bunch of his returns were leaked last year
56-4-1-3-1-2-1,"Indeed, the New York times published a big massive article about them, and then nothing happened"
56-4-2,For fucks sake.  Has any other Trump property been as profitable to him as the Supreme Court?
56-4-2-1,Nope. Why? Because trump isn't driving it into the ground like his other businesses. He just leaves it alone until he needs something and treats the Supreme Court like a vending machine.
56-4-2-1-1,"Oh, he's doing his best to run it into the ground."
56-4-3,Justice delayed is justice denied. All hail Mad King Trump and his Court Jesters Moscow Mitch and Leningrad Lindsey.
56-4-4,Copy/paste my comment from a decision not too long ago: *Chief Justice Roberts still ponders why court is seen as political…?*
56-4-5,"Why is this allowed to be a thing? Haven’t I seen like 10 different articles titled “Congress to get tax records after judge says it’s cool.” Trump is a spoiled child who keeps asking after being told no, except it’s actually gumming up the works."
56-4-5-1,"Because the supreme court is a partisan body pushing GOP interests and conservative grudges. They hope to delay a ruling until after congress is back under GOP control and Judiciary Chair Gym Jordan drops the whole request in favor of issuing thousands of Hunter Biden laptop subpoenas. If Dems are able to keep the House, I guess we'll see exactly how far Roberts is willing to go to cover up his party's crimes. Will he just straight-up rule that Congress no longer has subpoena power for financial records if it might make a republican look bad? Probably not. But who knows at this point? The Roberts court is completely untethered from precedent now and just rules according to their own whims and preferences."
56-4-5-2,> Why is this allowed to be a thing? Because it's there to help powerful people.
56-4-5-2-1,"This!  That’s why the court exists.  All that BS about the law, the constitution, impartiality, etc. is all a smokescreen for SCOTUS true purpose.   This court hasn’t even tried to maintain the usual secrecy.  They are there to promote their conservative evangelical agenda and to protect the GOP, especially Donald.  Oh, and in Alito’s case to bring back Medieval precedent for witch burning."
56-4-5-4,This stay is extremely temporary and is standard procedure. It does not indicate how the supreme court will rule but rather just a kind of default time extension for a few days.
56-4-5-4-1,Default time extension that has lasted Trumps entire life.
56-4-5-4-1-1,Death by a thousand temporary stays
56-4-5-4-1-2,Trump's entire life is an extension granted to him on ever being held accountable for all his shitty fraudulent schemes
56-4-5-4-2,"Totally normal for this, but not that Texas abortion law. Shove that shit through with all due haste, no brakes on that train, right?"
56-4-5-4-2-1,Are you sure that didn't get a temporary stay?
56-4-5-4-3,"Justice delayed is justice denied. Mark my words, Congress will never see Trump’s taxes."
56-4-5-4-3-1,Rettig is stepping down. Biden could put someone in place that would just release it. What's the Supreme Court going to do. They have no enforcement mechanism? Congress going to impeach him?
56-4-5-4-3-3,Agreed. Trump is never gong to be held accountable for his crimes either. I have given up all hope of that ever happening.
56-4-5-4-3-3-1,"It would be an absolute shame if the public took matters into their own hands. I'm sick of pretending conservatives offer anything of value to society, civilization, and the future. They should all be removed from society."
56-4-5-4-5,Temporary? They’ve been asking for Trump’s tax records for years!
56-4-5-4-5-1,"And they've been grated to congress every time. Even the last time the SC ruled. Really can't fathom how this case is any different. Already lost, again, at both the local and federal level. What new Constitutional legality argument are they expecting to hear - that this exact court hasn't already ruled on - that they'd be willing to take on the case?""Well, at that time we were at least *trying* to be bi-partisan. Now we've realized we don't have to since actions don't have consequences."""
56-4-5-4-5-1-1,"It’s different this time because the Dems could lose the house next week, all but guaranteeing that this shitstain’s taxes never see the light of day."
56-4-5-4-5-2,Literally was an electoral talking point in 2016.
56-5,Simply insane. I guess the actual constitution giving congress these powers doesn’t matter. The law doesn’t say they need to give a reason. Stupid.
56-5-1,The Supreme Court is all about taking away rights lately.
56-5-1-1,>The Supreme Court is all about taking away rightsAnd giving them to the GOP

56-5-1-1-1-2,100% this. Biden either expands the court and establishes a Democrat majority or it is going to remove him from office

All the while keeping them in a very unsecured location where foreign spies are known to have been.No consequences.He started an insurrection, in which several people including police died and they attempted to abduct the vice president so they could subvert democracy.No consequences.This is all just a dog and pony show. Congress might get his tax returns, but Garland will still do nothing.It's just depressing and what is going on over here in the UK is mirroring it. Blatant law breaking with zero accountability."
56-5-2-1,"Everyone on r/conservative is loving this and saying it’s good because he has nothing to hide and it’s all a witch hunt by the dems. How people can convince themselves of such a stupid, stupid viewpoint is genuinely beyond me."

56-5-2-3,"And David Brooks says that trump shouldn't be prosecuted because the public has no trust in the institutions (so they won't believe the charges are legit).  I'm like, we have no trust in institutions because we see trump committing crime after crime after crime, in broad daylight, for all to see, and the institutions do nothing about it.  If you want to restore faith in institutions, let the institutions prosecute trump for his crimes."

57-1-1-1-1-1-2-2,"Without responding in all caps, could you please answer: what??"
57-1-1-1-1-1-5,"Hah.  I could see Trump doing something like this.Get someone to write in Microsoft word for him ""Macron  used drugs and is gay."". And then trump, with a fat black sharpie writes on the top of it. ToP sECreT, and then he releases if, dating de declassified it..."
57-1-1-1-1-2,Do you really think Trump wouldn’t have blabbed about UFO base by now? The fact that he hasn’t is basically proof they don’t exist (and I want to believe).
57-1-1-1-1-2-3,"Or maybe they kept him out of the loop regarding aliens. He was kept out of the loop from lots of things. They know the kind of person he is, he couldn't be Trusted. He still can't be trusted as we all can see."
57-1-1-1-1-2-4,
57-1-1-1-1-2-5,"Correct. Some of these “mental giants” have argued with me that the Top Secret docs are “mundane” or will expose conspiracies around the DNC. Mundane Top Secret docs is funny enough but believing Trump- who has his very own social media platform where he retweets q accounts- would and could sit patiently on documents that would hurt the Democrats and is just waiting for the “right moment”? That’s laughable or insane- take your pickNo one, even the most ardent Trump supporter, can honestly argue that Trump is not impulsive and unfiltered. Being impulsive and unfiltered are exactly the kind traits they celebrate about him"
57-1-1-2,"Yeah the whole Reddit thought of “trump was going to sell this to the highest bidder”, that’s bullshit. There’s zero doubt in my mind that day 2 out of the office he started pedaling that information.Edit: I know my autocorrect mistake. Leaving for posterity to prove I’m an idiot."
57-1-1-2-1,Pretty sure he was doing it while in office. It's been said that he was carrying classified Intel all over the world on Air Force 1.
57-1-1-2-1-2,CIA assets started disappearing in 2019.
57-1-1-2-1-2-1,"Wow!  I wouldn’t put it past trump to be a traitor, I’d still have to wonder why , if even slightest suspicion of this, why nothing was brought up on this."
57-1-1-2-1-3,Early on he requested a full and complete list of all spies that the US employs.These events are much darker for us than most people understand. We may see a very bad attack on the US as a direct result.
57-1-1-2-1-3-1,"And obviously this is classified information, but I would not be surprised to find our overseas intelligence people are dying and/disappearing at an alarming rate."
57-1-1-2-1-3-1-2,"Yeah, there’s a story recently that supports your theory.  It’s already happened.   "
57-1-1-4,"Attempting to do so would just be yet another crime.Let’s not elect another openly corrupt and compromised individual ever again, kay?"
57-1-1-5,"uhhmmmm....how about NO???? the implications would be MASSIVE. i'm just disappointed that our government allowed something so easy to foresee happen. russian agent .45 never acted in good faith at any point of his human existence, and we place him in office with access to intelligence that could kick off the next true world war?? the hell we thought was going to happen when his presidency ended? that he would go away quietly with his dignity as a former president of the united states?at this point, any and EVERYONE could possess copies of any one of the HUNDREDS of TS documents gone from the white house. we're already fucked, people....now we'll conduct damage assessments for the foreseeable future in order to determine just HOW BAD we're fucked."
57-1-2,"A quid pro quo involving extortion *and* blackmail. This is a former US President, folks. We've left the next two generations with nothing but cleaning up our messes because of this. Seems to me that the conservative base is always saying ""Fuck the future"" when it comes to democracy, the world stage, and financial stability."
57-1-2-1,"Progressives want to make a better world to live in, and conservatives want to stop them because they would rather complain about the one we have"
57-1-2-1-1,"The core of American “conservative” philosophy is evangelical Christianity, which is a death cult that’s obsessed with things getting so bad the world ends and they ascend to heaven. So yeah, you can see why they are actively trying to screw the world over. They genuinely think they’re doing the right thing by hurting people. It’s farked."
57-1-2-1-1-3,">... the world ends and they ascend to heaven...They can just jump from a cliff, as long as they don't drag their kids with them.Far easier than a nuclear holocaust or environmental disaster."
57-1-2-1-1-3-1,"They truly believe they and their children (so long as they're not LGBT) will be ""raptured"" and magically physically ascend to heaven to live in utopia while the infidels down here burn in an apocalyptic hellscape. They're ushering in either one of those options because they fully believe they will not be around to experience that suffering."
57-1-3,What the hell else does the US government need? Why isn't every building owned by Trump or by anyone close to Trump being swarmed by the FBI right now? How isn't Trump and everyone close to him taken in right now? What does it take for the US to arrest a famous wealthy person?
57-1-3-1,"They are trying to minimize how bad the situation actually is so we ""feel safe"". The problem is, most of the sane Americans feel going this lightly is making us far more unsafe..."
57-1-3-1-1,Because it is. Treating Seditionists and Insurrectionists with kid gloves just means you get more Sedition and Insurrection.
57-1-3-1-1-1,"This is the one single instance in which I support the government acting with overwhelming force.  Protecting our fucking nuclear secrets.  We have over 5000 nukes.  5000.  Compromising the security of our nuclear arsenal or sharing it's secrets is so impactful to the political landscape of the world, has such great potential for damage on a scale the world has never known, that you should crush anyone and everyone who attempts to compromise it.  Decisively, without hesitation, and with no regards to collateral damage.  It's the most clear cut instance I can imagine where overwhelming force is appropriate."
57-1-3-1-1-2,"This is what I don't get. I'm watching from outside the country as a Canadian and the approach taken seems to be to minimize the waves so there is less conflict. But that's been the approach for how long and things just keep getting worse. You guys are the frog in the slowly boiling pot of water.With the increase of ignorant rhetoric from the right, which shows absolutely zero willingness to compromise or back down, where can things go other than violence?"
57-1-3-1-1-2-1,"It's because prosecutors have only one chance to get this right. If they mess this up, ANY hope of nailing DJT and Company is gone. Every move they make they have to make sure it's damning."
57-1-3-1-1-2-1-2,"yea, when they make the move, it has to be a checkmate else gg democracy and justice will lose the cause and evil will reign"
57-1-3-4,I agree but they need probable cause of a crime being committed. They need more witnesses to come forward and attest to seeing these documents. It won't be long in my opinion.
57-1-3-4-1,"If you dig up a body on one of someone's properties, isn't that sufficient for warrants on all the properties?"
57-1-3-4-1-2,They won't go anywhere without knowing they will find what they are looking for. Searching and finding nothing is worse than not searching.
57-1-3-4-1-2-1,"Exactly. The right is already pushing the idea that the warrant was politically-motivated. The last thing you can do is just search every one of his properties and find nothing. The fact that they searched MAL was really quite remarkable, and there must have been some intense debate about how to do it."
57-1-3-4-1-2-1-1,"Not for nothing,  but also likely half the FBI are magas.  Everything you do is also being sabotaged every step of the way."
57-1-4,"I feel like that would have been the case if a bunch of American spies and informants hadn't already died. My personal suspicion is that he took those documents and immediately gave them to every and any ally within arm's reach, as a favor to the authoritarians he admires."
57-1-4-3,He took it for money. He was selling info. He does everything for money.
57-1-5,That is Trumps m.o. Even if he doesn’t have the goods he will tease that he does ala Obama’s birth certificate.
57-2,"I've always thought he'd have a shot at holding those documents hostage. Like "" If you let me walk I won't hit ' send '. Of COURSE he has copies."
57-2-1,I would be surprised if he did that given his intelligence level.
57-2-1-1,Well his intelligence level is much higher now that he's stolen a bunch of it
57-2-1-1-1,He can't read.
57-2-1-2,"He's a malignant narcissist, not an actual idiot.He can't conceptualize that anyone else has standalone feelings or desires that differ from his own, and he won't bother figuring out anything that won't directly and immediately benefit him.The one thing he is incredibly good at, because it gives him immediate benefit, is criminal stuff. On those items, he is probably at the top of his field as evidenced by the fact that he has not yet gone to jail."
57-2-1-2-1,"Too much credit there IMHO.  He attempts a bunch of civil (e.g., not paying his debts) and criminal wrongdoings but is rarely held to account because he sits behind a wall of lawyers who have a variety of competence levels.  Rich folks with decent lawyers never go to jail - they just pay fines (or in his case declare bankruptcy to avoid paying fines)."
57-2-1-2-1-2,His English usage and style are at an elementary level.
57-2-1-2-2,"No he's an actual idiot. He just happens to have a lot of daddy's money he can pay smarter people to make the ""copy these classified documents"" decisions for him."
57-2-1-2-2-1,Does it bother you that he made that money himself 
57-2-1-2-2-1-1,He inherited nearly half a billion from his father
57-2-1-2-2-1-1-1,"He even lied about his inheritance when he was running in 2015.  I actually heard him say ""I only inherited 100 mil from my father"".It was the Journalists (!) Thank heavens for reporters, who did the digging and found out it was 450 Million.   He can't be honest about anything."
57-2-1-2-2-1-2,"Well no if it was from actual work.  Instead he takes investor's money on projects then cancels it and keeps the money.  He doesn't pay his contractors, lawyers, and certainly hasn't paid the fines he owes in cities where he held his rallies.  He also conned people out of money with Trump University which should have been the biggest red flag for anyone who supports him.  But no, he ""says it like it is"", ""a good business man"" and ""he's smart he knows how to play the game"" no this orange urinal cake with a wig is the most crooked president in the history of the United States.  Even surpassing Nixon at this point.Edit: I said cooked as if he was about to be well done...If only."
57-2-1-2-2-1-2-1,He’s an idiot but I’m on Reddit so I’m intelligent
57-2-1-2-2-1-4,Imagine being some poor rube that got conned by a guy who was a multi-hundred millionaire the second he was born into believing he worked hard and earned his millions through his own merits and then defend that guy online even though he'd sooner watch you get eaten by a pack of wild dogs than give even the slightest bit of a fuck about your life.You. I'm describing you.
57-2-1-2-2-1-4-2,Can you imagine someone inhereting shit loads of money and not going broke the next year like most people do and starting a business and having your name plastered all over buildings and hotels around the world?? Yea no and you never will know what that’s like from your parents basement
57-2-1-2-2-1-5,Look into his finances and family inheritance.  He's basically the beneficiary of his fathers wealth.  He is more unsuccessful than successful in business endeavors.  His companies have filed bankruptcy 6 times.  This motherfucker gets bailouts while the middle and lower classes get poorer.  This dude is a fuckin leech and grifter.  Do your fuckin homework.
57-2-1-2-3,"He is *not* a good criminal. Good criminals **don't get caught**. His own son tweeted out emails proving that trump and his family and his campaign had worked with Russia to corrupt the 2016 election. He himself released the transcript of his ""perfect"" call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where he very blatantly extorted the Ukrainian President to manufacture dirt on his political opponent.There's video, filmed and originally made public by his staff, of him at a private party he threw at mar a lago where the only guests were himself, Jeffrey Epstein, and 30 call girls. He hasn't coasted his entire life with minimal consequences because he's a master criminal. He's just a rich old white dude who can afford to bury legal troubles in paperwork long enough that they go away."
57-2-1-2-4,He's an actual idiot.There were classified docs in his desk. His personal desk. Ignorance and laziness were his only defenses here and that's a pretty hard argument to make when you have blindingly well-marked docs in your personal desk.
57-2-1-2-4-1,Says the dude on Reddit talking about one of the richest man on earth at point and our last president. Not giving a f#<k  isn’t being stupid but not being able to tell the difference is
57-2-1-2-4-1-1,Nope. Sorry but he is legitimately stupid. I’d love to simply ask him to explain Pythagoreans theorem. No fucking way he gets that 8th grade question. The single MOST important thing to know if building a structure and he would NOT know it. I’d bet a hefty sum on that. He’s been passed thru his whole life. Never told no. Never made to stand in his own and demonstrate any actual competency.
57-2-1-2-5,"Yeah, I definitely think it can be both. Just listening to him speak for a few minutes seems to confirm that. I’m not actually sure how any of his followers actually believe he is smart, aside from the obvious that they also are not-or the classic dunning-Kruger effect at play in both him and his supporters."
57-2-1-3,"Ugh, please... Yeah, he comes off as a buffoon. But, underestimating his intelligence is what got us here. We laughed at his presidential bid, he used that against us and won. We told ourselves he's an idiot and he came extremely close to overthrowing the government and taking over the country by force. Please, for the love of all that is, stop insinuating that he's stupid. The perception of his lack of intelligence has gotten him to where we are today. A divided nation that was dangerously close to being taken over by a fool with ""low intelligence"". He's a fucking menace. I'm not insinuating that he's a genius, but he's far more intelligent than we give him credit for, which in turn leads us to not viewing him as a serious threat. Which he's obviously proven himself to be. Over. And. Over."
57-2-1-4,"He doesn't think for himself, he has people do that for him. When he tries thinking for himself he ends up digging himself a bigger hole. Have you heard the guy speak? I don't think any more needs to be said here."
57-2-1-5,Mobsters are idiotic individuals. But they're great criminals. Trump is a typical mobster.
57-2-2,"Trump doesn’t do electronics. No chance he has taken pictures or scanned them digitally. They only exist as-is, in the physical. This has been well known for years"
57-2-2-1,"His enablers have certainly created electronic versions, as has anyone that has been given (or stolen) these documents while they were just chilling in a non-secure location."
57-2-2-1-1,I just don’t see how it’s possible. These documents are not physical and not meant to be photographed.
57-2-2-1-1-1,"Well that solves it then, if they weren’t meant to be photographed then surely they haven’t been!"
57-2-2-1-1-1-1,"I think what the person you are replying to means is that high security documents have physical and technological anti-photography anti-copying properties. Try to scan a 100 dollar bill and you'll likely end up with the feds at your door. I'm sure there are work arounds, but initially it either won't work or will alert the feds."
57-2-2-1-1-1-1-2,"An analog silver halide black and white camera, like old spy movies, works 100% to bypass any anti-copying protection."
57-2-2-3,"You're completely off here. Why else would they have taken documents out of the room and out of their boxes, just to place them back in there? Just to peruse? It's clear there have been copies made of these specific documents."
57-2-2-5,He also don't know how to pilot helicopters but still own and fly in them. Because he hire people to do it for him.
57-2-5,If he made one single fucking copy there should be shackles ready and no questions asked
57-3,This is what happens when you give clearance to someone who couldn't actually pass a background check.
57-3-1,Large amounts of debt is one of the biggest red flags for insider threats.
57-3-1-1,"This. I went through the process of getting a top secret clearance (for a job I ultimately didn't take), and when I was doing my ~3 hour interview, a disproportionate number of questions were surrounding my financial history to make sure it was as squeaky clean as I said it was. I told them all about my extensive recreational drug use in college, which is historically a big no-no for them, and they still grilled me way more about my finances."
57-3-1-1-3,"A neighbor of ours was getting a clearance for a job and they contacted us. I didn’t know him that well so I answered some basic questions and that was it. I could’ve lied if I actually knew him (if he was doing illegal stuff or anything) but it was simple stuff. No idea if he ever got it, I literally never talk to the guy. My dad had to get security clearance for his government job and I remember him telling me it was intense, but I was a little kid so I don’t remember being questioned. And he just did financial analysis and data crunching for projects around building M1-Abrams. After he gave up his clearance when he retired he stayed on to work but it was mostly expense reports for employee travel reimbursements and he got sick of it and actually left."
57-3-3,I wish that in order to file to run for office you had to first qualify for a security clearance. It would keep a lot of idiots out.
57-3-4,Didn't he get clearance for a bunch of his kids also?
57-3-4-1,Yeah his fat ass forced the clearances thru. For Jared as well.
57-4,Realistically speaking chances those documents haven't been copied multiple times by now and spread far beyond Trump are small to none.
57-4-1,I hope intelligence is already working under the premise that it's been compromised.
57-4-1-2,They are Edit: paywall free link 
57-4-1-2-1,"You're very careful not to mention that this article is from 2021, and has nothing to do with the documents Trump stole.Edit: I don't know when Trump stole the documents. I don't have any magic ability to discern the truth behind this. *But niether do any of you*. If you all want to make assumptions based on your biases, be my fucking guest. It doesn't make you right (ethically or literally) just because Trump is an evil person."
57-4-1-4,"They have to, really. God only knows who has what by now. Hell, for all we know, the Saudi prince might have framed copies of super top secret docs hanging on the wall in his office. After all, Jared’s $2B windfall required more than his massively overvalued private equity firm, alone."
57-4-3,Photocopied?I'd bet that someone just took pictures on his iphone or whatever of every single page. Probably being shared on some facebook group or something right now.
57-4-3-1,Photocopiers often store the images on an internal hard drive. Imagine if they seized that and found it had
57-4-3-1-2,"Well, you see those were presidential photocopiers and therefore anything copied on them is automatically declassified. /s"
57-5,"Sounds like there will be more searches performed in the future.I said this previously, but you might as well just assume all intelligence is compromised."
57-5-1,This absolutely wrecks any hope of a human intel pipeline for the foreseeable future.  Central Intelligence must be dry-heaving.
57-5-1-1,"It takes years and decades of work to build up those sources. These are sources that keep Americans safe.  But this is what happens when you get a bankrupt corrupt crime family in the White House.     The Republicans don’t seem to understand that with compromise sources, there could be real danger to Americans. There is some school of thought that they would put Americans in danger so they could come in with large(r) military budget and take over the government.   Their actions are antithetical to law and order.  Republicans are great at creating a crisis that they could “solve”.  At this point, you cannot put anything past the Republicans and the magas.    And now they’re calling for the FBI to be refunded."
57-5-1-1-2,"> The Republicans don’t seem to understand that with compromise sources, there could be real danger to Americans. and they suddenly care, why?"
57-5-1-1-2-1,I remember when Republicans publicly outed a CIA agent because her husband was pointing out the lies in their argument for going to war in Iraq.
57-5-1-1-2-1-1,Pepperidge Farm remembers.Dick Cheney has never been charged for any of these crimes. 8(
57-5-1-1-2-2,"They don't. Danger to America is a good thing for them. If there is another terrorist attack on US Soil from a person with ties to a country with resources and no nuclear weapons, a GOP admin will use it as casus belli to start funneling tax dollars back to KBR/Haliburton/whatever"
57-5-1-1-2-3,They don’t care they are seditionists that hate America. I’m not being hyperbolic.
57-5-1-1-2-3-1,"They love America. It’s just that they love the America of its real history—genocide, racism, imperialism—and not the America of its purported values—democracy, individual liberty, equal opportunity."
57-5-1-1-3,">The Republicans don’t seem to understand that with compromise sources, there could be real danger to Americans.I think they know. But they've been conditioned by AM talk radio and FoxNews to be loyal to party at all costs. Anyone, including the FBI, who is not deemed to be sufficiently loyal to the Republican Party is considered ""the enemy."" Just look at their knee-jerk hatred of schoolteachers. It makes no sense."
57-5-1-1-3-1,"Republicans think that anyone that is NOT a Republican IS their enemy. They do not care about their fellow Americans, they only care about their team and winning. Otherwise they wouldn’t gerrymander and stack the courts."
57-5-1-1-3-1-1,True. Party over common sense or common decency or anything good for the country.  Power and consolidation of that power is the goal.  Keep scaring the shit out of predominantly old school white people so that they can be given and fed their opinions by Tucker and Fox’s BS.  The Murdoch’s have brought the worst out in people and should be booted from the US.
57-5-1-1-5,"*sources that help keep developing nations destabilized.But yeah. Like fuck Trump and I hope this brings him down, but it's funny how people are suddenly defending an organization that has helped install more dictatorships world wide then literally any other single entity in history. The one that has torture facilities. The one that funneled crack into poor and black communities in the 70s and 80s. Seriously fuck the CIA."
57-5-1-1-5-1,"On the other hand, the CIA is also very likely one of the reasons Ukraine still has a free capital city."
57-5-1-1-5-1-2,Personally I think the massive amount of military equipment and air based Intel given to Ukraine that's doing the majority of that work.
57-5-1-2,"Conservatives will feel so silly when they realize he was a literal traitor who was aiding and abetting the enemy.Haha, just kidding. They'll blame the democrats and minorities."
57-5-1-2-1,"I'm calling it now — the literal excuse will be, ""if Democrats knew Trump was a traitor all this time, why didn't they stop him earlier? Clearly they were the ones perpetrating anything.""Etc."
57-5-1-3,It’s almost like people were predicting this train wreck 6 years ago
57-5-1-4,They would be pretty bad at their job if they didn’t know this was going on. I mean I don’t have the tools or access that these dudes and I could have told you that Trump was a compromised foreign asset years ago.
57-5-2,The damage done by Trump will be felt for decades and it’s possible the US will never regain the full trust of its allies.
57-5-2-1,They shouldn't trust us; we're essentially suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder as long as the pro-fascism minority in the country have inflated representation. Every 4 years they run the risk of getting a MAGA instead of a sane ally.
57-5-2-1-1,"You nailed the core of the US democracy problem: inflated representation in low population States.If the US switches to a real representative democracy, Republicans would lose power for generations."
57-5-2-1-1-2,"That's not how it works. Right now they're stuck between a rock and a hard place: their political power is an unhappy marriage between plutocrats and Jesus freaks. That bloc is fracturing as one side focuses on accumulating wealth, and the other keeps fighting lost culture wars.If this coalition breaks (which was happening before trump, backing him was them flailing around trying to stay competitive with a hail Mary), then that policy marriage folds and the party retreats back to center (this will happen before they die or form a new party). It's not so different to the death of the Great Society/New Deal democrats after getting crushed in 1980 (except the serious damage done to the health of democratic norms done by republicans in order to outsize their underwater representation as far as they dared - and farther) where dems suddenly facing a loss of popularity doubled down and lost more as well."
57-5-2-1-1-2-1,">which was happening before trump, backing him was them flailing around trying to stay competitive with a hail MaryAGREED, I really think it was a bad idea for conservatives to open themselves to attack by backing Trump so completely."
57-5-2-1-1-3,"In their current state you are correct.  If they were a healthy political movement, they would modify their platform (or you know, have one) to be a collection of initiatives and policy positions that voters would support...thats how its supposed to work.Pre-Trump, they used to have one, but Trump brought so much enthusiasm to them that they abandoned it in favor of whatever he wanted.  The problem now is that this has disaffected more moderate Republicans (but unfortunately has radicalized some of them as well). Their options as I see them are1) Continue on the crazy train2) Purge MAGA and return to mainstream politics.  This will cost them in the short term but may save the life of the party.3) The party dies or splits in two."
57-5-2-2,"10+ years I remember every kid wanting to go to the US for a school year abroad or visiting the US. Ever since trump became president, I barely hear anyone dreaming about the US anymore"
57-5-3,"Most people don't seem to realize that, whether Trump gave out secret information or not, enormous damage has already been done to the US intelligence community.  They can't know anything for sure and have to plan for the worst.  It will end up costing the taxpayer millions if not billions of dollars."
57-5-3-1,"Someone in Langley is very happy for the new budget. His colleagues in operations, not so much."
57-5-4,He HID the docs. He lied about having the docs. That means every building he owns should be closed down and seized until every document that can be found is found. He did this to himself. He fucked this country over so bad. He should be in jail awaiting trial RIGHT NOW.
57-5-4-1,"If the FBI is not watch him and his cast of comic book character’s every movement they are fooling themselves. If it looks like a duck it’s a duck. Obviously, Trump is working with others in his treason."
57-5-4-1-1,>him and his cast of comic character’sRight? He's almost a campy cartoony super-villain at this point He just keeps moving the goal posts and pushing the envelope to see what he can get away with. Really hoping he's pushed it too far this time...
57-5-5,>you might as well just assume all intelligence is compromised.I assumed that the day Trump won the 2016 election :(
58,Trump trashes his own right-wing majority in the Supreme Court after they denied his attempt to hide his tax returns.
58-1,"That's a masterwork of manipulation:- ""Why would anyone be surprised"" *you are correct to question this*- ""the Supreme Court ruled against me, they always do"" *I am a victim*- ""it's unprecedented to hand over tax returns"" *don't believe your own eyes*- ""Has Joe Biden"" *they are all corrupt*- ""he made illegally from Hunter"" *Hunter did illegal things and Joe is directly responsible for Hunter**Question what's happening. I am a victim; don't believe your own eyes if they tell you I am not. Believe only me.***The big lie: No President has ever had to provide tax returns. We are above the law.***Everyone is corrupt and I'm the only one you can trust. Biden's son is corrupt. Biden is corrupt by extension.*"
58-1-1,"Not only that, but he intentionally avoids talking about Joe Biden's handing over of tax returns (The same thing the court ruled on) and instead pivoted to the taxes he hasn't paid based on an entirely unfounded conspiracy claim. If Trump says ""Joe Biden didn't show his taxes!"" everyone will be like ""Yes he did, everyone did, except you"" and the game would be up. But he *alludes* to Biden's taxes to make unthinking people focus on the made-up part instead of the reality part."
58-1-1-1,"The way I read ""Has JOE BIDEN paid taxes on all of the money he earned ILLEGALLY...""    Is Trump admitting he has earned money illegally and thinks he doesn't need to pay taxes on that because of his fantasy that Joe Biden didn't either."
58-1-1-1-1,"Projection. People like Trump assume everyone else is doing the same things they are, because they can't wrap their heads the idea that other people think different than them. When confrontdd they just assume people are lying about their motivations, or they're covering it up. They can't accept that they might be wrong, or the bad guy."
58-1-2,"Frankly I think you missed the most important part of his statement, since every lie is an admission:> Has Joe Biden paid taxes on all the money he made illegallyNow, my expertise may be in bird law, but I like to think I have learned something in 40 years of the Donald trump show, and that is that Donald just admitted he makes money illegally and doesn't pay taxes on it."
58-1-2-3,Pretty much. I mean.. I don't think that's even up for debate. Plus many of his supporters are anti tax ppl anyways.Perhaps the joke there is most those ppl hate that the elite get tax breaks and the system is rigged for those type pplDonald Trump is one of the ppl they theoretically should hate. But for some reason don't.All though I do think it's starting to cave on him and most of the ppl that support him are the straight up lunatics. People that can see legit hard evidence he stole campaign money and used it for other shit.. or even hard evidence of him betraying the country.Think there is a certain group of ppl will always be loyal to him as they have never had a president represent them. The white supremacist groups and militias. He knew if he didn't criticize them he would be their king regardless.
58-1-3,"> ""it's unprecedented to hand over tax returns""It has LITERALLY ONLY EVER BEEN DONE by every single president except Trump, and by all of them willingly and voluntarily, without a legal struggle which can have no possible purpose except to conceal crimes...THEY REFUSED TO EVEN LOOK AT THE ELECTION HOAX OF 2020 merely because there is not a scrap of evidence to support my obviously self-serving claims!!!Seriously, fuck this absurd circus-peanut-colored shitheel. I'm tired of even hoping justice will eventually be served."
58-1-3-2,"The sad part is this never ends until he is dead. Nothing else ends it. Not arrest, trial, even conviction. His poison doesnt stop til hes in the ground."
58-1-4,You got it here man. Right out of a Nazi playbook.
58-2,"Biden’s taxes are public.Edit: thank you for the gold,kind Redditor!"
58-2-1,Will his cult believe that though
58-2-1-1,"Just find them, post them on truth social as a big leak, put the right tags and they might believe they're real.BIG NEWS BIDENS TAX RETURN LEAK, SEE HOW POOR HE IS COMPARED TO TRUMP RABBLEDABBLE #MAGA #LETSGOBRANDON #TRUMP2024"
58-2-1-1-1,"Sometimes, I do consider infiltrating the far-Right and spreading truth as if it's something that would actually appeal to them."
58-2-1-1-1-5,"Which is all too ironic, considering the name."
58-2-2,The SC has never had to order it because no one else has ever refused to do it.
58-2-2-1,It's not simply breaking the norm of voluntarily releasing tax returns. The Supreme Court ruled against Trump because no president in history has been so full-on crimey. Nixon was small potatoes in comparison.
58-2-2-1-1,Yup. Every time you find out more about that motherfucker it's worse. I loathe him on a molecular level.
58-3,"""Biden does not pay taxes for his illegally made money, why should I?!"" He should stop assuming everyone does what he does, it is telling on him."
58-3-1,"Why should he stop? It hasn’t hurt him yet. Fucker was elected president, caught red handed with stolen classified documents, and he’s still a free man. I don’t condone any of this, of course - I think he belongs in prison. But we’re way past the point where we should think looking bad in public will somehow hurt Trump."
58-3-1-1,"Motherfucker lead a coup, they stormed the capital building. Feels like I'm taking crazy pills."
58-3-1-1-1,200 years ago they would have hung him. I can't believe they haven't even filed charges yet its been 2 years.
58-3-1-2,"The man has recorded audio of him admitting he molested beauty pageant contestants, and was still elected president afterwards. There are no rules for the Right, as long as you're as hostile and despicable towards anyone who isn't a cishet white Christian theofascist as possible, you can get away with rape, murder, and treason. This isn't fucking hyperbole, this is literally a truth that everyone in the USA and beyond knows and people just accept it and say ""it really sucks, somebody should do something about it."" The January 6th committee is the last chance at doing something and I bet it'll be as limp-dicked as every other attempt to prosecute Trump has been. The system has fucking failed you and Americans with all their gun-toting machismo have proven to be the most frail fucking impotent and domesticated electorate on the planet."
58-3-4,"Same reason he cheats at golf, he thinks everyone does it, so he can and should."
58-3-4-1,"Which is why almost all cases of actual election fraud are perpetrated by his supporters, who figure ""hey the dems are clearly cheating so I will too"".  Nut jobs all of 'em."
58-3-5,Every accusation from Trump and the Right is a confession.
58-3-5-1,"I just don't see how his followers can't see that there is no right or wrong decision for Trump, just what he assumes to be beneficial for himself. Trump's ego and privilege has put him in a mental state where corrupt officials are the norm, so he sees actual abiding by the law as corruption. It really is a bizarro world he lives in."
58-4,"I don't think ""the courts *always* rule against me"" is as good a defense as he thinks it is."
58-5,"""The Supreme Court has lost its honor, prestige, and standing, & has become nothing more than a political body, with our Country paying the price.""Is there a word or phrase in English that describes agreeing with someone's statement word for word, for the exact opposite underlying reasons? We need that word in English if we don't have it."
58-5-1,irony?
58-5-1-1,One of the primary goals of a Russian operative is to discredit public institutions.
58-5-1-1-1,"This is true. And it can be simultaneously true that certain public institutions genuinely deserve to be discredited based on their actual conduct. Which we shouldn't lose sight of, even if it does partially overlap with certain Russian goals"
58-5-2,It's probably a German word.
58-5-2-2,Schaedenfucker: feeling glee at Trump's pain.
58-5-2-2-4,ShaedenTrumpin?
58-5-2-3,"If the phrase gets used more than ten times, Germans will just remove the spaces from between the words and call it a new word.  That's how new German words are born.  They call it Entfernensiedieleerzeichenzwischendenwörternundnennensieeseinneueswort."
58-5-2-3-1,I love how so many German words are just a bunch of smaller words wearing a trench coat and spitting on you.
58-5-2-3-1-1,"My favorite is the word for glove, handshoe"
58-5-2-3-1-1-2,You're all sleeping on the German word for birth control.  I kid you not: antibabypille.
58-5-2-3-1-1-2-1,I just call it son block.
58-5-2-3-2,"I don't get why this always blows non german speakers minds. All we do is merge words.So instead of writing ""cheese burger"" it's just a ""cheeseburger"". Gramatically it's still a burger. And when spoken it's not distinguishable, unless you awkwardly emphasize spaces.Other way around, if it was a bag of pre sliced cheese intended for burgers, it would be burgercheese."
58-5-2-3-2-1,somehow 'burgercheese' sounds way less appetizing than 'cheeseburger'
58-5-2-3-2-1-1,"Well tbf, I don't think anybody does it in that case... But you could. I just wanted to give a relatable example of how it works, while being very hungry... Most people would just say cheeseslices"
58-5-2-3-2-2,"I think its because when you grow up with a certain amount of spaces in certain places, you kinda rely on them to parse what you are reading.  To me ""Entfernensiedieleerzeichenzwischendenwörternundnennensieeseinneueswort"" looks pretty much *exactly* like ""Entfernsadjfhiousuewrhuiwerfjnisdjnksdjnsdfvhuierwuhiowerfjnkkljsdfjkhbasdfueswort"".  (they're both gibberish afaik, but the point is to my english reading brain they are indistinguishable without spaces.)That said, I do think English should combine a few words.  ""eachother"" should 100% be one word for example."
58-5-3,"It is called a ""Janus Sentence""Edit - Since it's apparently some sort of tv reference people think I am referring to..A Janus Sentence is based on the two faced god, where everything has a left/right meaning depending on how you read it.The most common one you probably know is""May you live in interesting times"" where some refer to this as a blessing and others refer to it as a curse.It's also used to say something negative in a positive way. ""You would be lucky to have Redditor work for you"" It can be interpreted as is, and that you are lucky if you can employ this person, but also the complete opposite in that if you hire this person, you will be lucky if they actually do any work."
58-5-3-3,Ok I spent longer than I should have trying to understand what I thought was a reference to the nasally-voiced clingy character on Friends before looking this up.Glad to have learned something.
58-5-3-3-1,"The only reason I know it is because of my Chemistry teacher talking to my English teacher.He said ""Everytime Yorae0 speaks, I don't know if I have just been complimented or insulted."" and the English teacher told him about Janus Sentences and then he told me later about it."
58-5-3-5,I could be wrong but I think Australia being referred to as “the lucky country” is one of these. I’ve heard that it was originally a joke because Australia was so difficult to live in for the first colonisers but then over the next two centuries it became a genuinely nice country to live in and now people living here do consider themselves lucky (for the most part).
58-5-3-5-2,"Donald Horne wrote ‘The Lucky Country’ in it he says: When I invented the phrase in 1964 to describe Australia, I said: 'Australia is a lucky country run by second rate people who share its luck."
58-5-4,">The Supreme Court has lost its honor, prestige, and standing, & has become nothing more than a political body, with our Country paying the priceWhen you are right but for the wrong reasons."
58-5-4-1,It's weird when he issues this complaint when they finally do something that's not obviously partisan.
58-5-4-1-1,Its intentional. He wants to ride the coat tails of legitimate discourse until people buy in. Then once these people are ready for him to shoot someone on 5th street he empties thier pockets and raids the governments coffers. Just dont listen to the dude. He gets his rocks off by taking advantage of otherwise trusting people.
58-5-4-1-1-1,Fascinating. I’ve always been amazed that fascist have to use the existing systems to gain access and power and instantly dismantle it once inside. I wonder why they never invent an alternative system from the jump and convince people to support that?
58-5-4-2,"You're not wrong Walter,  you're just an asshole."
59,Trump is going to die of old age before they find the courage to indict him
59-1,"Yeah, this part baffled me when J6 occurred and I sat there’s watching it on tv. When is was over, everyone just up and went home like it was a school field trip! Insane."
59-1-1,"Not only that... they were shocked when they got arrested like 6 months later.""What do you mean that was illegal? Trump told us to do it!"""
59-1-1-1,"Every single Jan 6th participant: ""Trump told me to do this"" ""Trump gave us the go ahead"" ""This was Trump's idea"" ""We were following Trump's orders"" ""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Trump"" ""Trump said this was the plan""Trump: I didn't do anythingDOJ: Well I guess Trump isn't responsible!"
59-1-1-1-1,Every sane observer: Just indict his arse already
59-1-1-1-1-1,The fact that everyone who has been convicted has gotten slaps on the wrists is crazy. The fact that Trump is still walking around is crazy. I have 0 faith in the justice system when traitors get off and white supremacists/republicans can terrorize people willy nilly.
59-1-1-1-1-1-5,"The earliest cases were the ones that were really easy to prosecute, people who went in, did a little petty vandalism, and left when they got bored without ever attacking anybody. They were minor crimes on an individual level and got light sentences. The more serious cases involving violence or seditious conspiracy that need much more investigation and evidence have only more recently started making it to trial and are resulting in much longer sentences.In general, the January 6 insurrection benefited from their leader still being the one in charge of the federal government and choosing not to activate the national guard. If they had waited until Biden was in power, there may have been a much larger military response and an easier time making arrests as well."
59-1-1-1-1-2,"It’s like the new Nuremberg Defense perverted. Not only is “just following orders” not a defense, The one giving the orders is beyond reproach. Just like corporate America. Workers suffer, owners skate. Every. Fkn. Time. You thought Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz got away with Guantánamo murder… You ain’t seen nothing yet."
59-1-1-1-1-2-1,Ron DeSantis (governor of Florida and likely next GOP President) was literally a lawyer in Guantanamo Bay overseeing enhanced interrogation.
59-1-1-1-1-2-1-1,Enhanced interrogation Enemy CombatantHomelandA whole new American lexicon introduced post 9-11
59-1-1-1-1-2-2,Reminds me of those Wells fargo tellers fraudulently opening accounts without clients knowledge. Bad thing to do. Except district managers knew it was happening and still increased pressure on tellers to keep numbers going up. Worse thing to do. Congress had a hearing and laid out how Executives may be responsible. Of course Executives acted like they didn't entirely know what was going on.  The worst thing you could do. And the only ones permanently punished were the tellers making less than $20 per hour.
59-1-1-1-1-2-3,Or all the kids that Obama killed in Yemen. He sent more bombs than anybody else. Killing kids and farmers left and right while being praised for his humanity lmao
59-1-1-1-1-3,"fascists having the Supreme Court majority is really bad, but if Garland was going to judge the same way he runs the justice department, kinda glad he didn't get the spot afterall."
59-1-1-1-1-3-1,"I don’t know man. He’s being fastidious to make sure it’s done right. Indicting a former president shouldn’t be easy, otherwise we slide into a troubling scenario where the morons who just got McCarthy to kowtow would indict every former Democratic President they could. People who haven’t drank the Kool-Aid can easily see that he should be indicted, he had essentially been bragging about the crimes publicly as is.So if he was going to be this careful on the bench, he probably would have been decent. I doubt he would have been using laws from before the founding of America as basis for laws of today for example."
59-1-1-1-1-4,It's been my conspiracy theory that they're not acting against him because they don't want to set the precedent of holding a president accountable for crimes committed while in office.
59-1-1-1-1-4-1,"Ulysses S. Grant was arrested for speeding. If he can be arrested for that, but Trump can’t b for sedition, then that’s pathetic."
59-1-1-1-1-4-1-3,"Grant never showed up to court, nor was he pursued so he was never convicted."
59-1-1-1-1-4-2,Just flee to Florida. Bolsanaro's there. Trump is there. Evidently it's now a haven for failed coup leaders and wannabe right wing dictators. Are they going to have to extradite Trump to DC or Georgia for him to stand trial?    /s
59-1-1-1-2,Then you have the MAGA dweebs on the internet who want to claim that some random dude in the crowd was **actually** responsible for what happened on Jan 6.
59-1-1-1-2-1,And also that random dude is antifabillclintonfbirussiandemocrat
59-1-1-1-2-3,Are you talking about the Fed that was literally yelling to storm the capital?
59-1-1-1-2-4,>Ron DeSantis (governor of Florida and likely next GOP President) was literally a lawyer in Guantanamo Bay This Covid which is no worse than the common cold is a Chinese virus funded by Soros and made by Fauci!  /s
59-1-1-1-3,"The DOJ hasn't said anything of the sort yet - the investigation is still ongoing. These things take time (arguably, too much time - but they're hopefully doing it right.)"
59-1-1-1-3-1,"Nope.  I watched crazy shit go down for four years while he was president.  I watched Jan 6th.  Nobody's done SHIT.  I'm all outta ""these things take time.""  That's what they said about the Mueller investigation.They're gonna drag things out, tell us, 'These things take time."" until people lose real interest and investment, so that when nothing is done, the people won't react.In the next 20 years, someone with the same morals, but less crazy and incompetent than Trump will gain office, and they'll succeed where Trump failed.  They'll do it because they see we drag our feet and nothing is ever done.  There are no consequences to failing a coup."
59-1-1-1-3-1-2,The criminals were in charge for those four years - Barr blocked any real possibility of Trump being held accountable. Merrick Garland has been AG for less than two years and we already have multiple special investigations into Trump (the Mar-a-Lago documents and January 6th) proceeding.
59-1-1-1-3-1-3,Mueller rolling over for his masters was the first tell.I'll never forget how they touted him as an honest Republican with principles. Lol what a con. He was a Republican. Period.
59-1-1-1-3-1-4,"I agree. Every single dayt of his presidency was an absolute shit show. Between all the lies and corruption, there were his hundreds of daily tweets to keep everyone misinformed, outraged, and off-balance. The news headlines were complete chaos. Sadly we all got so used to it we were numb. And when Biden took office....well,  the peace and quiet had been so long overdue. I think half of us still have 'chaos ptsd' from that godawful sack of shit."
59-1-1-1-3-2,"It's been two years, bro. Trump gonna be in the ground before any charges are levied."
59-1-1-1-3-2-1,"The Watergate investigation took 2 years and resulted in 69 indictments with 48 convictions.  This involved *thousands* of people, it's going to take time."
59-1-1-1-3-2-2,"Get ready for trump to never be charged, the DoJ refusing to ever comment on it, than 8 years from now merrick garland will write his memoir and say there wasn't enough evidence to charge trump."
59-1-1-1-3-2-2-1,> 8 years from now merrick garland will write his memoir and say there wasn't enough evidence to charge trump.Correction: he'll write his memoirs about how there WAS enough evidence to convict him but they didn't for X Y Z reasons and he'll use the BOMBSHELL to sell his books just like that coward Bolton.
59-1-1-1-3-3,"The Feds could have arrested him day 1 of Biden's presidency, based on the concluded Muller investigation alone."
59-1-1-1-3-3-1,Yes. Or the stormy daniels matter.
59-1-1-1-3-3-1-1,"Or the daily displays of blatant criminality and corruption. His crony in the post office disrupting the mail, pocketing COVID funds, not divesting from business and openly accepting bribes via his DC hotel, breaking nepotism laws to install family members into positions of power that they used only to enrich themselves, threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless the nation fabricated evidence against his political rival... and it's all just endlessly ""under investigation, please be patient.""Fucking Republican POS Merrick Garland, the explicitly Christian-fascist Republican party endlessly propping him up, and the status quo ""moderate"" Democrats who don't want to rock the boat with concepts like criminal accountability. Don't tell me to be patient.Arrest him! he violated a House subpoena just the other month! He stole our national secrets for resale!"
59-1-1-2,"> ""What do you mean that was illegal? **Trump told us to do it!**""I just fucking hate how it's all so obvious that Trump played a obvious and quite clearly knowing role in all of this, and yet we have to prove to some sort of impossible level that he knew in his mind that endlessly and publicly questioning the election and saying it was stolen and saying let them bring guns actually constituted him committing a crime. Meanwhile you can be charged with murder for driving the car of someone who robbed a store and killed someone."
59-1-1-2-1,Which makes them all guilty in the death of A. Babbit.
59-1-1-2-1-1,"Not that I would have any sympathy for any of them if Babbit's death was somehow used against them, but, to my knowledge, if using the store robbery scenario I used earlier, I don't believe the driver would be charged with murder if the person robbing the store was killed in the process."
59-1-1-2-1-1-2,Comission of a crime resulting in death. Not sure about DC laws though.
59-1-1-3,"I happen to know a dad whose two sons ""were just there."" The way he explains how his sons were treated, you'd think they were some sort of terrorists.Fuck around and find out."
59-1-1-3-1,It's amazing how many people were just walking around minding their own business in a crowd full of people chanting 'Hang Mike Pence' and then were swept into the Capital by no fault of their own after watching people beating on the doors and windows with fire extinguishers and rocks. If only a police officer had kindly directed them to move away from the Capital... surely they would have complied.
59-1-1-3-1-1,"The brothers were behind the person breaking a window. I'm sorry but if a government building is being actively attacked, I'm gonna go the other way."
59-1-1-3-1-1-1,I don't even like being in a crowd of people that are in a good mood... I have no idea how people can go to Trump rallies.
59-1-1-4,"Brainwashing is a real thing.4 years of Trump's tabloid politics that normalized rightwing and racist violence and demonized his political opposition did some real damage to susceptible minds.The Republican Party endorsed it all with their inaction, defense, and support."
59-1-1-4-1,Don’t pretend this started with trump. Conservatives have been dog whistling their base for years. trump just stoped using it.
59-1-1-4-1-1,True. I say it started with Gingrich in 90s and eroded to outright sedition over the next 30 years
59-1-1-4-1-1-1,I would go further back with Reagan. The similarities between him and trump are scary.
59-1-1-4-1-1-1-1,You misspelled Nixon.
59-1-1-5,"When you’re sent by the president, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the podium. You can do anything."
59-1-1-5-1,Speaking of podiums... that guy only got 75 days in prison.Although he does live in Florida... not sure if they counted that as time served.
59-1-2,"I'm a pacifist, but the weirdest part was armed police being crushed and bludgeoned by people with fire extinguishers and bats and flagpoles. Like, there's too much Police violence in the USA, and I know Kent State continues to cast a long shadow on the National Guard, but if there was ever a time to discharge your service weapon, it is when a screaming mob that has built a massive gallows outside is storming the literal capitol of your country. If you are being crushed to death, it's time to put some rounds on target. Even St. Augustine thought that it was permissable for good people to engage in violence to restrain the evil people from hurting the innocent."
59-1-2-1,They were in on it because when Roe was reversed it was VERY planned for.
59-1-2-1-2,J6 was planned for! Everyone even vaguely plugged in with antifascist outlets/research knew it was coming. I still have the texts I sent to my family on J5 telling them it would happen.The level of police preparation on J6 was EXACTLY what the people giving orders wanted it to be.
59-1-2-1-2-1,I remember seeing it all over Twitter. How can certain agencies claim that they had no idea?!
59-1-2-1-3,"> it was VERY planned forIncluding the Capitol Police. Minimal manning with no reserves. The Chief never got on the radio once the entire day. Intelligence about the attack was known by the Secret Service for days, they didn't tell Democrats. Republicans gave the attackers a tour the day before even though the Capitol was closed for Covid. They showed them the offices of Democrats and escape routes. Not a single Republican, SS agent, or Capitol Police leader has ever been charged."
59-1-2-2,"I agree with you on the face of it, but I think a big part of why they didn't is because they knew there were a lot of armed people in that crowd *looking* for a reason to escalate and nowhere near enough capitol police to do anything about it with or without guns.Shooting into that push, even when justified, could have easily thrown the crowd into an even greater, consuming frenzy and escalated that situation to an even greater degree than what it already was. I do have the dark thought that maybe if it was even worse (instead of a largely impotent, self-incriminating, live-streaming event given the scale and potentiality that was there) that maybe the country as a whole would take it more seriously, but it could also have steeled those broken, conservative victim mentalities even further too."
59-1-2-2-2,">Shooting into that push, even when justified, could have easily thrown the crowd into an even greater, consuming frenzy and escalated that situation to an even greater degree than what it already was.Shoot one.Then say, ""Yeah, you'll all beat me as a crowd, but I've got 5 more bullets.  Who's first."""
59-1-2-2-4,"I don't think they actually saw/recovered very many rioter firearms at the scene at all, but I might be wrong. I thought it was like literally a dozen or something among the whole crowd (which Newsweek claims numbered as many as 120,000 on the mall at its peak)."
59-1-2-2-4-2,"There were a number of people armed with firearms, knives, and other makeshift weapons. There were also pipe bombs strategically planted and most likely stashes of munitions. Don't be naïve. Babbitt's shooting was justified; Capitol police would have been justified in shooting many more. Many of the rioters were there to kill."
59-1-2-2-5,"You're giving the rioters way too much credit.  The fact that there were few if any actual guns in the crowd makes it clear that they were not expecting a real battle.  A few bullets from the police would have scattered them. That said, it could have made the conspiracy theories after the fact worse."
59-1-2-2-5-1,"There were plenty of guns in the crowd, if you ask me. And if we had arrested people that day, we would’ve found them. There is a reason why folk gathered outside of the metal detectors that trump had set up for his speech. And when Trump figured out that people weren’t so excited to go through the metal detectors he ordered them to be removed."
59-1-2-2-5-1-1,">There were plenty of guns in the crowd, if you ask me. And if we had arrested people that day, we would’ve found them.If your speculation were true it would mean they had guns and chose not to use them."
59-1-2-3,"To be fair, that's what the assholes wanted to happen. Why they had a ""QRF"" of idiots waiting to go in guns blazing. Amazing restraint by the police force"
59-2,"Who among us, watching January 6 unfold live, didn’t think to themselves: “What, they’re just letting them all go??”They had hours to set up new perimeters outside the Capitol, and “kettle” the insurrectionists, herding them right into detainment and processing when they tried to leave.But, our criminal President instead wished them peace and told them that “we” loved them.Only their own stupidity- live-streaming the crime- has allowed so many to be arrested (after plenty of time to destroy other evidence)."
59-2-1,Especially because we saw the “show of force” during the BLM protests. We know what they could have done cuz we all WATCHED them do it few months before. Then we saw them do nothing and eventually saw them escort people out. The whole thing was ridiculous and to this day I’m confused how anyone can look at that and still think we don’t live in two different Americas
59-2-1-3,Imagine if an unknown police force came to toss them in unmarked vans like they did with BLM.
59-2-2,"We have a military that's supposed to protect us from invaders, but they sat on their thumbs while the Capitol was attacked.Makes em look kind of useless."
59-2-2-1,Probably because the leaders told them to stand down. The rot goes deep.
59-2-2-2,>	We have a militaryTrump ordered them to stand down  That's kinda the entire point here
59-2-2-3,"The military is constrained regarding actions it can take against Americans, and that's a good thing.  Trump would have used them against us if he could have."
59-2-2-3-1,Storm Capitol = military stomp. Not general stuff. Not protests. One situation. Storming the US Capitol. This was a major loophole that needs to be closed. Protect the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. They were attacking the Capitol to disrupt the whole democratic process. That should have resulted in the military securing the place.
59-2-2-3-1-1,"I don't disagree, but the CiC orchestrated the coup.I'm not sure under what circumstances the military should act without civilian authority.  We have allowances to refuse unlawful orders, and I think that's all that's safe."
59-2-2-3-1-1-1,Telling soldiers to stand down while a coup is ongoing seems like a hella unlawful order.
59-2-2-3-1-1-2,"Frankly I could see invoking the 25th Ammendment , and or the Commander in Chief being relieved of his duties, in failing to uphold the Constitution, so Vice President Pence, evidently was giving some commands, in the absence of President Trump. I imagine if push came to shove, the command structure could have fallen to Pence in part.Frankly, it seemed abundantly clear after evening fell that with the capitol secured, it was made very clear to Donnie that you give the speech or you won't be president much longer. That was by his own advisors."
59-3,I’m told holding republicans accountable for their actions sets a bad precedent.
59-3-2,But not doing it seats a bad president.
59-5,"Yeah but, Bolsonaro is in Florida, NOT under arrest, so…"
59-5-1,"Because in the US you can't just arrest fascists just because they are behind a coup attempt, that's only for countries with a functional system, like Brazil..."
59-5-1-3,">	that's only for countries with a functional system, like Brazil...I'm Brazilian and let me tell you we don't really have a functional system lol. I'm actually surprised this happened and it's actually amazing that basically every politician is against this pathetic coup attempt (congress, senate, both left and right). It's great that these people have been arrested but I doubt the actual people behind this will be punished (those who financed and organized it). I wouldn't hold my breath, but I am indeed hopeful. And yes I am aware Brasília's (Brazil capital) governor was put on leave for 90 days because of his inaction, but let's see if it amounts to anything real."
59-5-1-3-1,"I know your system is far from perfect, it was more throwing shade at the lunacy that is the incompetence of the US system, than it was praising the brasilian."
60,"Megathread: January 6 Committee Announces Criminal Charge Referrals for Donald Trump and AlliesToday, in what is likely to be its final hearing, the January 6 Committee voted to refer criminal charges for Donald Trump and several of his allies to the Department of Justice. The committee will release its final report on its investigation into the attack at the Capitol later this week. The committee also voted to refer several members of Congress who ignored its subpoenas to the House Ethics Committee."
60-2,"Love this line from the report.*""According to testimony received by the Select Committee, the only advisor present who supported President Trump’s inclination to declare victory was Rudolph Giuliani, who appeared to be inebriated.""*"
60-2-1,"from ""America's Mayor"" to ""that guy with the running hair dye and ill-fitting suit."""
60-2-1-1,"I'll always remember his speech about this election in front of the Four Seasons Total Landscaping building. You know, the one just across from the crematorium and up the street from the adult book store."
60-2-1-1-1,"I'll always remember him saying that there were no terrorist attacks on US soil until Obama was president... Except that he was literally the mayor of NYC during 9/11. ""Never Forget""!"
60-2-1-1-1-1,"I’ll always remember how close he was to being president. Holy shit he had so much good will from just happening to be mayor on 9/11/01. And now, he’s….that."
60-2-1-1-1-1-1,"Realistically, he never had a shot. He was a potential front runner at one point before the voting started but had one of the dumbest primary strategies I’ve ever seen and it sank his candidacy pretty much from day 1.He knew that he had no chance in Iowa and New Hamphsire because the primary voters there were mostly Christian conservatives. So instead of competing, he just skipped them entirely choosing instead to focus on Florida, thinking that the big delegate haul there would propel him to victory.Problem there was that Florida didn’t vote until Super Tuesday and he took a string of losses in states he skipped leading up to it. Not surprisingly, by the time Florida rolled around, he was labeled a loser and had no chance there either.Was probably inebriated then too."
60-2-1-1-1-3,Republicans have this weird thing where they view 9/11 as somehow unavoidable. So they just don't count it.
60-2-1-1-1-3-1,"No no no they just blame Obama. I'll never forget the video of the guy asking, ""Where was Obama during 9/11"" thinking it happened under Obama."
60-2-1-1-1-3-1-1,"Yeah, but like, where was he?! IKEA? Bowling with his children? Playing chess in the park? Riding on the metro? The people have to know!!!"
60-2-1-2,"Who kept farting on live TV during the voter fraud hearings, tried to have sex with a girl he thought was 15, scheduled a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping where he had a very bizarre meltdown that not even South Park or Saturday Night Live could make up, has been divorced 3 times with one of those marriages being to his second cousin for 14 years and another ending after allegations that he was sleeping with a staffer (which he denied, and then married said staffer after the divorce was finalized), started all the weird Hunter Biden laptop conspiracy nonsense, made extremely bizarre references to the movie My Cousin Vinny at a press conference, and there's probably a ton that I've forgotten about because it all got very difficult to keep track of anymore..."
60-2-1-2-1,Don't forget the hair color spray crap running down his face.
60-2-1-2-2,>not even South Park or Saturday Night Live could make upTrey Parker and Matt Stone have talked about how difficult the Trump years made it for them. Coming up with stuff that was more bizarre than what was happening was very difficult.
60-2-1-3,Don’t sell him short. He was also caught in the Borat movie with his pants down trying to bang the Russian chick he thought was underage.
60-3,> Pence says DOJ charges against Trump for Jan. 6 would be ‘terribly divisive’  Charging somebody for breaking the law has nothing to do with whether it's divisive to the people not living in reality.  That is a completely unacceptable datapoint he's trying to introduce.  The people who think Trump shouldn't face accountability are already pretty fucking divided from the rest of us.  You know what's terribly divisive?  Insurrection!
60-3-1,"They never for one moment thought pursuing impeachmebt for Bill Clinton would be divisive.  They never thought years-long campaigns agaisnt Clinton, both when she was secretary of state and a POTUS candidate, were divisive.So we are just doing exactly what they CLAIMED to be doing - pursuing a clearly criminal individual for the purposes of justice.EDIT:  I just want to add I know, obviously, that Republicans knew very well all of these moves would be highly divisive and polarizing and knew so before they did them, and did them not *in spite* of them being divisive, but precisely *because they would be*.That's the point."
60-3-1-1,Bill Clinton did something wrong in his personal life which they insisted on bringing to the forefront of public discussion and Hillary Clinton hasn't been shown to do _anything_ wrong besides maybe not following precise protocols for her personal email server (small potatoes compared to Trump stealing national records). It's not even comparable.
60-3-2,You misunderstand why Pence said that. 2 reasons why he said he doesn’t want Trump charged and prosecuted. 1. Donald Trump will throw absolutely everyone under the bus to get out of jail. Every person who gave him ideas on how to destroy democracy will now have Donald Trump testifying against them so Trumpty Dumpty doesn’t have to sit in a prison cell next to his toilet. 2. Those Republicans that Donald Trump will flip on include Mike Pence. Just because he didn’t go full Mussolini on Jan. 6th doesn’t mean he didn’t try to overturn the election before hand
60-3-2-1,"Good, he can finally drain the swamp and take them all with him"
60-3-2-3,"AFAIK Pence has no legal exposure here, so Trump turning on him just means impotent bitching and lying. Pence has already lost the MAGA crowd, so there isn’t much leverage at all."
